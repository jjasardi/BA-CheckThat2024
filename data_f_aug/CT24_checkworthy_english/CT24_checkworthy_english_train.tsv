180	I want to keep this economic recovery going.	No
16690	This - talking about more people at work - is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living over the last two years - it means that - women and young people had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't do enough to pay the increase in the cost of food and housing and clothing.	Yes

6401	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	No
6897	It's not a government plan.	No
8603	Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	No
25179	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that I will not make age a problem in this campaign.	No
10662	I know how to do this.	No
2831	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	No

29704	We must ensure that they respect and respect communities.	No
34065	That's what Donald thinks.	No
19904	I'm very sensitive to education.	No
10393	That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	No
8117	If we are doing well here, if we are fulfilling our obligations, if we are moving forward, then I think freedom will be guaranteed all over the world.	No
18737	We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.	Yes

14812	Now, I also believe that this meeting of this mission, this responsibility to preserve peace, which I believe is a responsibility of our country, and that we cannot evade our responsibility as the leader of the free world because we are the only ones who can do so.	No
8428	I think it would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	No
16750	In addition, we need to develop our research and development.	No
14912	At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	Yes
11763	I just want to make sure the return is good.	No
32577	Why didn't you?	No
12737	If you don't mind, I would like to use the rest of the time to respond to one of Senator Kennedy's comments on the previous question.	No
7278	Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.	No
16684	I remember when Alf Landon was against social security and, later, President Nixon, 16 years ago, told the public that John Kennedy's proposals would go bankrupt and double the cost.	Yes
15749	And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	No
24116	And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.	No
32736	And I'm pretty good at it.	No
25716	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	No
16152	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	No
20823	Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	No
26223	But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and not everyone has the opportunity to prove that they are qualified, I prefer the right type of affirmative action.	No

14983	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many people who would be given a job are currently wards of the government and it would not be wrong to give them a tax incentive, because they... it does not cost the government either.	No
23063	We're not talking about Third World drugs.	No
17387	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	Yes
29179	My father was a little businessman.	No
114	It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.	No
22244	Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	No
19664	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	No
19753	It's a very difficult environment.	No
1827	That is, I want to lower the rates.	No
24254	And they recognize that we have great difficulties, but they are also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have here tonight.	No
23614	But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	No
17175	No one else thinks they do.	No
25754	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	No
2416	What you did was pass a plan without a single Republican vote.	Yes
18992	I can't say that more clearly.	No
20778	There is a difference of opinion.	No
23977	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	No
8830	Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	No
20600	It will be a wonderful time for the Russians to enter the Balkans and convince Mr Milosevic that it is in his best interest and that of his country to leave.	No
34044	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	No
31891	I'm certainly not proud of that.	No
16331	Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.	No
22920	We're going to build alliances.	No
2074	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	No
264	You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	No
27992	We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	No
16198	Margaret, I'm not sure I have all this in a minute.	No
1780	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	No
30083	And the only way the US troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not.	No
5930	And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	No
1739	Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.	Yes
27280	And what I want to do now is hire more teachers, especially in mathematics and science, because we know we're late in mathematics and science.	No
19049	And we'll continue to spread freedom.	No
28424	Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.	No
23304	You looked at me like my clock was up.	No
6193	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	No
1608	And we did not set an example for our own people.	No
27955	I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	No
25216	"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	Yes
6197	But what I believe in the end is that women, in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are best placed to make this decision.	No
17908	And contrary to what the President says, I think their environmental assessment is inexcusable and often shameful.	No
8430	I prefer higher salaries for teachers.	No
29376	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	No
823	Made him a part of our foreign policy and stoned aid to Contras through convicted drug traffickers.â€°Â¤	Yes
31858	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	No
16766	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	No
10505	Warren would be a very good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm happy to have his support.	No
8177	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move forward.	No
27708	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began protesting, this nation -- me, my administration -- was with them earlier than any country.	Yes
27476	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	No
19559	And a lot of things the President spoke about, he turned to the United Nations.	No
16245	So I think we can all share, with respect, the fact that the message may not come out.	No
13915	I do understand creating jobs.	No
7187	Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	No
20272	He spends more money on tax cuts for the richest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defence all combined.	Yes
15183	That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.	No
7087	In September 2003, it supported amnesty for foreigners in an irregular situation.	Yes
24015	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	Yes
29012	One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	No
28050	I too want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on families whose lives were reversed yes - tod - last night.	No
6777	And that's why I support that.	No
13819	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	No
16689	He has four times as many deficits as Mr. Nixon himself.	Yes
872	I know that the people you choose make a huge difference in your ability to govern and that I set high standards.	No
31940	We saw it after the first debate spent almost a week denigrating an ancient Miss Universe in the most difficult and personal terms.	Yes
12251	We are a big industrial state.	Yes
18213	We just read on the first pages of American newspapers that there are more than 100,000 hours of unheard-of tapes.	Yes
22435	If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	No
23923	I think that the American people will make their own decisions about character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action, I think they need to clearly understand each person's background.	No
6506	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	No
1350	And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	No
25551	And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	No
7667	I am therefore saying that both candidates and vice-chairpersons, I also hope - including Senator Johnson - will have to discuss this issue on every occasion.	No
3968	It's ruled by a handful of tribes.	No
22163	We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	Yes
29580	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	No
16712	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	Yes
14690	Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
34079	And let's be clear about what he's saying and what that means.	No
4249	But if it had been done, it is possible that we could have avoided the question.	No
13537	Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	No
26120	We've got this country going in the right direction.	No
6950	Of course, we respect our obligation to our veterans, and they know that.	No
10662	I know how to do that.	No
27691	We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	Yes
11411	That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	No
19810	I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	No
23090	He added more debt to the US debt in four years than George Washington to Ronald Reagan combined.	Yes
20647	The morale in today's army is too low.	No
3230	This is a typical example, perhaps many others, where this administration overturned an elected government and helped establish a military dictatorship.	Yes
3624	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	No
13938	I'd rather there were jobs left here than see everything heading south, you know?	No
17395	And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	Yes
5984	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	No
21959	But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	No
6472	I'll hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	No
5517	But what we haven't seen yet is a rescue plan for the middle class.	No
19377	Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	No
24321	We're weak in the world.	No
26239	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	No
26677	They sell a lot of cars here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	No
29236	In fact, Donald was one of the people who took root in the housing crisis.	Yes
18059	I don't believe the United States did that.	No
15857	Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	No
28660	I don't think that's the role of the president.	No
23129	Let me see where to start here.	No
18554	But I have a plan to do it.	No
25447	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.	No
33595	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	No
854	But did I feel a desire that Lloyd Bentsen might be your racing companion when you said there were three people on your ticket?	No
9080	It has been a time of illusion and false hope, and the more it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	No
21073	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	Yes
18615	That's why it's essential that we win.	No
27156	You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	No
30056	I participated in a number of efforts to take over the leadership of Al-Qaida when I was Secretary of State, including, of course, taking over the leadership of Bin Laden.	Yes
14941	But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	No
8946	And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.	Yes
15816	He's the one who got us this agreement on arms control.	Yes
17857	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	Yes
28457	So, to answer your question, it takes a clear vision, a willingness to listen to our friends, and credibility for both friends and enemies to understand when America says something, we want it.	No
2380	And three-quarters of them said that it made us less likely to hire people.	Yes
26730	It's God's will, it'll happen.	No
9041	Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.	No
28082	They love him because he doesn't do what I really think I need to do to make decisions to doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to someone other than the HMO or the insurance company, let yourself go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before calling 911, to let you see a specialist if you need, and he has strong bipartite support.	Yes
29377	When I walk around, Lester, I'm telling you, I've been everywhere.	No
13477	This means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here, in all possible circumstances; because the moment when we lose confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it makes gold flow.	No
2909	In many cases, we have concluded agreements, as in Vietnam, which were later revealed to our embarrassment.	Yes
24212	Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	No
3146	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	Yes
31840	And I think it's very important for us to make it clear to our children that our country is really great because we're good.	No
27680	This is important for nuclear weapons.	No
28885	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	No
19574	It's like you said in Texas one day, you know you've increased taxes too much, and you've done it, and you've cut the defense too much, Mr. President, and you've done it.	No
28507	If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	No
33285	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	No
28802	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	Yes
27113	I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.	No
1586	We now spend 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took control of the White House.	Yes
33467	If we got along well, it'd be good.	No
17529	And I don't agree with that.	No
24428	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	No
22970	Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	Yes
2371	Instead, it increased by that amount.	Yes
2517	When Ronald Reagan came to the post, he set out the principles he was going to adopt.	No
16603	Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.	No
27254	We can do better than that, especially in Latin America.	No
24331	We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	No
33069	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	No
8356	Mine has been in the executive branch.	No
16652	But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	Yes
15863	I thank you for that.	No
29699	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	No
21971	I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	Yes
10075	That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander-in-chief.	No
339	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	No
32137	It's good to -- one in three.	No
23977	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	No
32977	I hope they will see how they do it, but if I have the chance to be president, I will act immediately to ensure that we fill it, we have nine judges who can work on behalf of our people.	No
28981	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	No
415	I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep interest rates down.	No
33093	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	No
16317	I think the more we depend on foreign oil, the less our national security is strengthened.	No
13401	In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	No
23264	I have a tax cut.	No
5656	I know how to eliminate programs.	No
24169	This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	Yes
28526	But spending money without a strategic plan can often be wasted.	No
5547	He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.	No
15424	The United States must be a strong nation; the United States must be a secure nation.	No
30338	I will go very quickly.	No
28518	And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
162	So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	No
6054	So here's what my plan does.	No
26915	And so what we see is a rather dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for this region.	No
19982	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	No
6343	And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	No
1064	I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	No
16763	Each of these jobs would have cost taxpayers $25,000.	No
4107	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not Iran's most powerful person.	No
10909	I vote against them, my friends.	No
32594	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	Yes
28233	I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	No
33785	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
8374	I think you have heavy obligations that affect our security, which we will have to respect.	No
25291	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	No
23394	You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	No
13267	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	Yes
3986	And if John wants to disagree with that, he can tell me, that if the United States has Al-Qaida, bin Laden, high-level lieutenants in our eyes, and Pakistan is unable or not able to act, then we should get them out.	No
11873	And for our society to be as hopeful as possible, every child in America must be educated.	No
74	I say that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a particular responsibility, not only to design programs, and I have described in detail the very important, very strong enforcement program and prevention of drug awareness.	No
15326	In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.	No
24221	No one wants any more interference, so let's get the program through.	No
17093	Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	Yes
11671	I wouldn't have sent any troops to Haiti.	No
18467	I don't think he was misleading.	No
4286	I have to say it, Jim.	No
7279	I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	Yes
16127	I am interested in 240 million citizens of this country who share the American dream, all in all parts of this country.	No
16127	I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	No
28387	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	No
24747	But keep in mind that we spend 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million uninsured people, we do not have prevention and primary care.	Yes
22060	That is priority one in this country.	No
1851	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	Yes
12600	Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	Yes
19198	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	No
10718	And some of these programs may not develop as much as we would like, but we can set priorities transparently, by knowing the American people perfectly, and by consulting fully, not done in camera, and by invoking assignments in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even have - sometimes we don't even know for months later.	No
12470	I want to make sure we rebuild our army to maintain peace.	No
27887	I think anyone can check the file.	No
6579	We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.	No
2999	Today - 75 percent were for Israel before.	Yes
15494	We had great success in my own state.	No
19378	But let me respond to what you said.	No
21213	And whoever thinks I say it, it will be the first bill I'm sending to Congress.	No
4149	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	No
10983	I think this is a responsibility in this respect in that we should have health care available and affordable for every American citizen, for every member of the family.	No
25034	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	No
26317	I'll keep my word for you.	No
31996	He had to pay a $850,000 fine to one of the women.	Yes
17481	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	No
14725	With regard to employment -- that's the top priority, and I believe that my program to stimulate investment, encourage small businesses, adopt a new approach to education, strengthen the American family and, yes, create more exports is the way forward.	No
34399	We must repeal and replace Obamacare.	No
7402	I think we've got a lot more work to do.	No
2631	And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	No
11850	A jury found them guilty.	Yes
6935	They have poor health care.	No
29510	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	No
5718	You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	No
25242	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	No
22181	And he literally tells communities, reinventing schools, not just bricks and mortar, but the program and everything else.	No
9047	And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	No
50	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
4318	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	No
2565	It can't do anything, but it can make a difference.	No
21871	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	No
13006	It is about making more progress in the field of civil rights than we have done so that we can be a good example for the whole world - a democracy in action at its best.	No
13678	Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.	Yes
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
15375	It was a promise for less government, less taxes and more freedom for the people.	No
29006	You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	No
6054	That's what my plan does.	No
29327	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win this debate.	No
19793	Maybe in your case maybe just two.	No
29266	We invested in a solar company, our country.	Yes
1038	At the other extreme, uh - only 1 percent of the richest people in our country get 25 percent of all tax benefits.	Yes
26797	It's not about President Clinton.	No
18236	And so the best indication of when we can bring our troops home - what I really want to do, but I don't want to do it to bring them home; I want to do it because we have achieved a goal - is to see the Iraqis accomplish and see the Iraqis intensify and take responsibility.	No
17466	I therefore believe that this is the purpose of law enforcement.	No
2219	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	No
26112	First, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	No
19705	Saddam is probably as strong as he ever was.	No
32882	... but we believed that we could make the country better.	No
16657	We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.	Yes
19463	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	No
14474	And they buried him until after the election.	Yes
34354	Actually, I think it's the opposite.	No
20514	This is important because the next president will appoint three and perhaps even four Supreme Court judges.	No
6309	Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.	No
14097	There are many good ones, but I was glad he recognized it.	No
26944	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	No
17424	Before campaigning as a Democrat for a Republican presidential candidate, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	No
32416	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	Yes
22260	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	No
1548	There was a restoration of faith, trust and confidence in the presidency because I was open, frank and frank.	No
16480	For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	Yes
7922	And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	No
18872	And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	No
27770	They steal our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hack our computers, counterfeit our property.	Yes
975	We live and bring everyone.	No
14603	We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	Yes
15573	Ann, the Vice-President made this commitment.	No
27171	But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	No
19244	Actually, I was going home, my mom was telling me, Bob, all I have is my social security and my Medicare, don't cut it off.	No
11475	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	Yes
25564	The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	Yes
3097	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one third of what it is under that administration.	Yes
22194	But she's absolutely right.	No
21939	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	No
16546	I've heard of these dividends in the past; it always happens.	No
13544	Let us remember that the way to win is not to step back and not surrender.	No
2564	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	No
13000	We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	No
16916	Mr. Ford vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills a year as Mr.Nixon.	Yes
24776	Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	No
12332	And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	No
23373	They leave the sky and the environment behind.	No
17042	I believe we can all work together to ensure that people in the future have more and that we can all work together to build a better America.	No
24081	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my efforts because they are deeply concerned that we have taken away the American dream from them.	No
8356	Mine's been in the executive.	No
34403	This is part of my commitment to raising taxes on the rich.	No
32111	What about the other 15,000?	No
17186	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	No
12705	The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.	No
28716	You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	No
12464	I'm running to get some things done for America.	No
12966	Why did we offer the Congo three hundred students last June when they had had the immense revolt?	No
15356	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	No
17194	It must defend the values of decency that the American people defend, and it must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world towards a safer world.	No
2840	I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.	No
17853	So far, it is only a beginning.	No
28925	And in some cases, he may still be at large.	No
2506	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	No
27509	And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	Yes
21251	I want to thank everyone who looked and listened tonight because this is really a crucial period in American history.	No
13544	Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	No
26396	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	No
20931	You don't test every year.	No
14837	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	No
17687	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	Yes
12196	And second, I'll tell you again...	No
12695	We're quarantined Mr. Castro today.	Yes
24905	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	Yes
17466	So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	No
7780	That is why we have passed an authorization - not an aid bill - that was the first time, in fact, since the Inter-American Bank, founded a year ago, was developed, that we really looked at the needs of Latin America, that we partnered with these people.	Yes
29503	And believe me: The day Obama leaves, and he leaves, and goes to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed doesn't do their job.	No
9133	They're barely enough to pay for my food and an apartment.	No
16134	So that's not where we should go.	No
10124	So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	No
12739	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	Yes
57	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	No
20174	And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	No
14477	I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.	No
32488	That in itself is a big difference.	No
30262	We are a country that owes $20 trillion.	Yes
26678	And this is very important for the economy, but I think we want to make sure.	No
2228	And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	Yes
18015	And that's what people now see in Afghanistan.	No
2381	I just don't know how the president could have taken office, faced 23 million people without work, the rise in unemployment, an economic crisis at the kitchen table, and spent his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	Yes
34278	It would take a lot of negotiation.	No
2195	And every health care economist who examines it says that over time, what will happen is that the traditional health insurance system will collapse.	No
1574	And I believe we need someone who can work in harmony with Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country and who can bring a new image and spirit to Washington.	No
16109	That is absolutely not true.	No
14898	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	Yes
25219	After that, once again, our embassy exploded.	Yes
20841	Here is the role of the federal government.	No
17591	The system is still where it was with regard to progressivity, as I said, and that has not been changed.	No
13461	And it is because of my conviction that if America is going to have the growth that it talks about and that we want to do, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people from going out and discovering more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	No
18526	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	No
1296	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	Yes
12752	Now, when we have a candidate for the presidency, for example - Senator Kennedy - saying again and again that the United States is second in space and the fact is that the score of space today is twenty-eight to eight - we have had twenty-eight successful shots, they have had eight; when he says that we are second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I have seen ours, and we are not; that we are second in science because they can be ahead in one field or another, when on the whole we are well ahead of the Soviet Union and all the other countries in science; when he says, as he did in January of this year, that we have the worst slums, that we have the most overcrowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like that, what does that do to American prestige?	Yes
25167	We will, as I say, be busy trying to find the centres from which these operations come, and reprisals will be taken.	No
24030	And I don't want to do that.	No
14492	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	No
16963	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	Yes
16918	I think that under the presidents for Nixon and Eisenhower, they voted about 60 to 75 per cent of their legislation.	Yes
18273	I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.	No
27137	That's the kind of leadership we're going to continue to show.	No
22580	The president gave the first per cent of the income-earnings in America, earned $89 billion last year, more than the 80 per cent of those earning $100,000 or less all together.	Yes
8490	I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	No
26512	Now, if he's going to do it again or not, I've heard some say, well, that's the model we should use and if he's been re-elected, maybe he'll come back and try again.	No
20227	I want to take half the surplus and spend it on social security.	No
27524	Bob, let me just respond.	No
29225	And what you're doing is you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	No
24626	Barbara, I think, is doing an excellent job of destroying the myth about AIDS.	No
2004	You've been president for four years.	No
10724	"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	No
33077	We must therefore look at this issue in depth.	No
29461	Let's start the clock again, Lester.	No
90	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	No
13899	This does not mean that we must write it in the law.	No
14188	It wasn't the best for me and I knew it at first.	No
7508	And, with faith in God and with conviction in America's mission, I believe that we can reach higher.	No
13156	It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	No
1679	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your birthday.	No
1447	Now we've had this break, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - say that this break for a month or two was healthy, because we couldn't honestly have maintained a growth rate of 9.2 percent that we had in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
11337	We have young people who have the grades, the will and the motivation to go to college, but they don't have the money.	No
17031	In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	No
31872	And this is happening on a weekly basis.	No
10324	Government does not create jobs.	No
32855	To go back to the first question.	No
2841	I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	No
25309	I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	No
13397	It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.	No
27536	And we're going to keep pressuring to make sure they don't have nuclear weapons.	No
33333	One of my first actions will be to get all the drug lords, all the bad ones -- we have bad and bad people in this country that have to go out.	No
12367	I feel very strongly the same place.	No
19642	So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	No
573	I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	No
28255	I think we -- I think we should make our schools the number one priority of doing the best in the world, all schools.	No
18610	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	No
3115	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	No
21049	I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	No
29955	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	Yes
11700	Let me begin by commenting on what the Vice-President said.	No
27397	Bob, I just need to comment on this.	No
5550	And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.	Yes
491	I think it is good.	No
171	We've had enough, ladies and gentlemen.	No
22012	One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	No
239	But we need to have a knowledge base.	No
6795	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	No
22852	And if we have to be hard on Iran, believe me, we'll be tough.	No
20907	All schools, all school districts, the students themselves, and the required teacher tests, which goes a step further than Governor Bush was prepared to go.	No
6731	I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.	No
29132	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	Yes
26530	A good starting point is to say that no managed care provider can win a doctor and turn the doctor away from the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	No
3036	It's for their security as well as ours.	No
21389	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.	No
16912	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	No
25228	Different people with different points of view fight each other.	No
31926	And that's what I want to talk about.	No
1463	Savings accounts lose money instead of making money.	No
25045	A President must know those things.	No
4203	You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	No
20874	His science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	No
17154	"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	No
9277	20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out an act of migratory bird to attack them on a criminal basis.	Yes
7953	I think it may be necessary for us to have more taxes.	No
8448	Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.	No
14273	Governor Clinton said, well, I could have been with the minority, let the sanctions work - but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	Yes
1516	At the present time we're at peace.	No
6206	I supported this effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	Yes
2011	And this... I love the idea of four trillion dollars in cuts.	No
11984	But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	No
3269	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	No
34165	And you'll see the dozens of sources checking that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
24961	I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	No
7281	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	No
1677	It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	No
2876	Of course, this is another indication of trying to use the defence budget for political purposes, which he is trying to do tonight.	No
15749	And if we move forward with the kind of policies that the Vice-President suggests tonight that have in the past, this debt will grow more and more.	No
29515	When we have a country that hurts so much, that is torn apart by all the countries of the world, that's the kind of thought our country needs, because everyone -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all the countries we do business with, almost $800 billion a year.	Yes
22134	So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	No
1441	Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.	Yes
17408	We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	Yes
32705	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	Yes
9015	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	No
12462	Jim, thank you so much.	No
3191	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	No
12364	We may have different approaches to how we deal with local people.	No
20671	The warning signs are real.	No
10175	-- we didn't have the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartite basis.	No
28691	I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.	No
33318	I was in New Hampshire the other day.	No
25486	I don't trust the Russians.	No
23174	You should have come to the Senate and voted in his favour.	No
14923	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	No
20786	$665 billion over ten years for the richest 1%.	Yes
28418	You may not be one of them, but you're not one of the right people.	No
62	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	No
32103	And then, please, go to...	No
7532	Over the next four years, we will continue to work to ensure that health care is available and affordable.	No
7017	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	No
18365	And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	No
8662	The man who should be here tonight to answer these accusations chose not to attend.	No
3885	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	No
23054	Four years ago, in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people import drugs from Canada?	No
5670	Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.	No
24912	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	No
13274	Number three, the Vice-President, on 15 May after flight U-2, indicated that the flights were in progress, even though the Administration and the President had cancelled the flights on 12 May.	Yes
4157	It's an error characterizing my position.	No
474	And what he's saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's willing to call a woman a criminal for making that choice.	No
2069	The first two weeks she has them, some are sitting on the floor until they are reassigned.	No
422	There are two very different issues here, and they need to be dealt with separately.	No
29275	So I will tell you this.	No
14106	On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.	Yes
29497	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	Yes
21645	So you have to create jobs.	No
23651	You know, it's just not that simple.	No
22454	Now it's gonna change America.	No
22842	Now they have the bombs and we're less secure.	Yes
28252	And only one out of every 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition fee at the private school.	Yes
1922	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	No
20616	But I think we need to be very careful in the current situation before inviting the Russians to play a leading role in mediation.	No
2898	Every time we made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it was because the American people were excluded from the process.	No
22142	If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	No
15058	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	No
32163	Number three, women cannot be billed more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it was before the Affordable Care Act.	Yes
21376	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	Yes
33575	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	No
4027	And I know how difficult it is for an army and an army to recover.	No
2762	I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	No
12248	And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	No
32772	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	No
14432	And what you see on this whole door of Iraq is a bunch of people who were wrong during the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do some revisionism.	No
10187	And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	No
2301	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	No
21602	Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	Yes
19815	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association, which sent many delegates to the democratic convention, which gave 99.5 percent of their money, the Democrats, and the president, and many teachers sent their children to private schools or better public schools.	Yes
26053	And three of those checks were my grandparents'.	No
23489	The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	Yes
16862	I believe in tax fairness for middle-income taxpayers, by increasing the personal exemption.	No
19152	One seventh of the total economy, 17 new taxes, price control, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	Yes
26424	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	No
13986	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	No
21948	It's a black church just outside Washington, DC.	No
3269	And the United States will maintain our interest in national security in the Panama Canal.	No
2460	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're watching 50 million people lose health insurance...	Yes
2476	In my opinion, the government is not effective in reducing the cost of almost anything.	No
24095	The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	Yes
17363	They want the equal rights amendment to be ratified.	No
25634	They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	No
25625	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	No
22966	Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.	No
18672	And, yes, he would have been stronger if we hadn't dealt with him.	No
6114	And you can go buy your own insurance.	No
14869	Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	Yes
19785	I'm very forward-looking.	No
15459	I did not have the experience that the President had in carrying out this mandate, but I think of myself as the governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh economic power in the world - I too had a few moments and lonely decisions to make.	Yes
15563	I hear this talk about a blank check.	No
24051	I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	No
11861	I think, however -- I think, as sure as I'm sitting here, most Americans really care.	No
13082	I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.	No
3884	An election law these last few days.	No
2211	So that's -- that's number one.	No
33867	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	Yes
20499	This nation can certainly come together to promote the value of life.	No
10888	We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.	Yes
25815	"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	No
2135	My grandfather died a while ago.	No
14033	And you're looking at one who's in these campaigns around the two candidates.	No
11239	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	No
19846	I don't know what time it is, but he's probably late.	No
24823	I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	No
17133	I told the American people that it was a real problem, that it could destroy long-term economic growth, and I told you what I think should be done.	No
854	But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	No
23996	I believe that the way to reduce the deficit is to control the growth of compulsory spending programs, not to increase taxes on the American people.	No
33255	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	Yes
14235	I love the fact that everyone, especially in the media, passes over town hall.	No
19963	They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	No
22084	Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	Yes
18754	And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.	No
8760	But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	Yes
2004	You've been president four years.	No
25325	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	No
29012	One of the reasons people are skeptical is that people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	No
7107	We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	No
15372	But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	No
19629	In my view, the policy has failed.	No
6267	In some cases, we will have to invest.	No
17893	Are we building the future that this nation needs?	No
7398	There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	No
17615	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion in Medicare.	Yes
226	Let me say this about AIDS.	No
23782	The Commission of 11 September published a report according to which America is safer, but not yet sure.	Yes
31889	I apologize to my family.	No
12926	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	Yes
18317	And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes.	No
25773	We have to respect one another.	No
25701	And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	No
8978	And I can only tell him that we have reduced per capita spending, per capita government size, as a proportion of other states - we have only increased the size of the government one-twelfth of what it had increased in the previous eight years.	Yes
23608	I'll tell that person exactly what I'm gonna tell you right now.	No
7792	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	No
26455	In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.	Yes
10042	I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.	No
23228	This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	Yes
1796	That's not my analysis.	No
2633	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	No
28875	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't follow the new drugs.	No
17819	Many people predict a recession.	No
2045	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	Yes
17204	I don't think a leader should spend his time in Ovale's office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	No
14082	And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	No
22991	The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	No
12116	It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.	No
8111	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	No
124	I'll say that...	No
12989	We are talking about schools - three times more classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	Yes
25828	But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	No
1407	I had the opportunity to appoint a person to the Supreme Court and chose the Illinois Court of Appeal judge, John Paul Stevens.	No
3267	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	No
25326	And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	No
3283	But let me comment on the report.	No
15752	We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.	No
19146	I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.	Yes
13803	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	No
29695	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	Yes
10986	But it is certainly my responsibility.	No
22145	I shall conclude on this point.	No
19320	How does he avoid conflict?	No
27809	That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	No
29777	Property crime is down 40 percent.	Yes
4357	All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.	No
11000	Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	Yes
18725	So I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to involve other nations, right next to us.	No
32611	Because she was a disaster as a senator.	No
11760	I thought the President had done the right thing with Mexico and strongly supported the Mexican administration.	No
14146	They weren't ready.	No
18920	And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	No
7591	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	No
9295	How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	No
14627	I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.	No
20212	I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	No
27250	We will do this by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear power and our renewable energies.	No
29695	Since the first day of my campaign, I have therefore called for criminal justice reform.	Yes
20148	I would like to leave you with the idea that the things I do as president are essentially motivated by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what is or is not happening in this country.	No
7210	We have to make sure they're educated.	No
8760	But also, I think it is safe to say that we have energy sources that have not yet been used or found.	Yes
19882	You are for school uniforms and curfews and you are opposed to absenteeism.	No
708	We're not making those choices.	No
24414	This is something I learned by forging this great and very successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	No
7701	We sit on a conspicuous stage.	No
16850	But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	No
29474	And when you look at what you're proposing...	No
34392	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	No
24810	And then I think about the elderly people who are retired.	No
2658	I'm not talking about it.	No
31862	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	Yes
34080	He's denigrating -- he's talking about our democracy.	No
32710	We need to worry about ISIS before we can get involved too much.	No
9393	I'd get rid of it.	No
13920	Everyone says it'll create jobs.	No
22165	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	No
19553	But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	No
33461	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	No
28059	It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	No
8213	A record is never something to stand on.	No
2746	We had 43 consecutive months with unemployment above 8%.	Yes
14710	He was tried for 12 years and failed.	Yes
1321	However, I honour the right of people seeking constitutional amendments on the school bus, on prayer in schools and on abortion.	No
24180	And we're going to start setting up teams to set up - to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	No
18209	The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	No
13835	The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	No
7846	I do not yet understand why this administration and Mr Nixon are opposed to providing medical care to the elderly under social security to ensure their security.	Yes
34287	And so we are going to do very careful and thorough checks.	No
10948	That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.	No
21450	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	Yes
8821	I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.	No
8934	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	No
8803	we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	Yes
21015	We have moved from a triple recession in the last 12 years to a triple stock market.	Yes
5984	Of course, we have an immediate crisis right now.	No
32339	But it's important to us as a politician, you know, not to say, as Donald said, we're going to ban people based on religion.	Yes
398	Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.	No
11497	One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	No
14850	There are always problems in the world, and the way these troubled areas are dealt with by a single president in this oval office directly affects our nation, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	No
21499	So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	No
20091	He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	No
7810	It is above all an ideological battle - a battle for the minds, hearts and souls of men.	No
29465	Then you didn't read it.	No
1385	The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	No
9690	Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	No
6940	This may explain why Medicare patients complain about being expelled from Medicare.	No
11530	I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	No
5769	For me, it was so hurtful.	No
27956	And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	Yes
7972	In the Truman administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain, including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	Yes
25510	It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	No
22981	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
26845	So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.	No
22345	I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	No
10782	The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	No
4028	And he did it and we're going to win this one and we're not going home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	No
392	And we should be prepared to provide these funds.	No
12795	I do not think that even if this effort fails, it will be necessary to carry out tests in the atmosphere that pollute the atmosphere.	No
15096	And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	No
3178	Under this administration, this force was not realized.	No
23724	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	No
10353	We don't have to settle for four-dollar gas.	No
11207	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	No
8343	I have met with the legislative leaders.	No
23751	We're not doing it today.	No
23610	I'm a Catholic. I raised a Catholic.	No
2095	In fact, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small businesses, drilling operators and so on.	Yes
17518	Well, as far as this personal choice is concerned, isn't that what the murderer insists on, his right to kill someone because of some fault they think they justify?	No
27310	They're still number one today.	Yes
15029	Those who suffered discrimination because of their race or sex certainly knew that we had a racial problem.	No
18103	Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	Yes
32158	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	No
2012	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	Yes
24938	I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	Yes
14154	It wasn't failing to serve.	No
20751	We're talking about a massive government, folks.	No
96	Panama is a friendly country.	No
1030	The major effort we must make is to put our people back to work.	No
17396	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	Yes
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
34033	I think they're going to see through it.	No
31862	Last year, we had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion.	Yes
12631	And that's what concerns me.	No
13800	I think it is important to elect a president who is committed to reviving the economy and who realizes that we must abandon the trickle-down economy and put the American people first, and who will send programs to Congress within the first hundred days to address the crucial issues that America calls for leadership on - jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	No
24098	We need to invest and grow.	No
22313	Just a fact clarification real quickly.	No
25585	I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	No
14656	And so I'm going to make the call on a wide range of questions.	No
12932	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	No
11668	I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.	No
33989	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	Yes
8614	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
29793	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	No
12099	It is to make health care affordable and available in this way.	No
26712	When you have 900 files gathered by a guy who's a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at a file, an FBI file.	Yes
24079	And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.	No
9438	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	Yes
26622	Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	Yes
14495	The people must take over their government.	No
24051	I do not agree with the fact that we need 150,000 soldiers to fulfil our role in Europe.	No
15574	He broke it three times last year.	Yes
32778	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	Yes
9473	Over the last 15 years.	No
8021	Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	No
21592	That happened when I was president.	Yes
21980	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	Yes
17449	I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	No
5628	If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	No
28131	And you asked a good question because they're not just elderly people.	No
8524	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	No
351	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	No
16349	Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	No
18846	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	No
1710	Let me talk about what I think we need to do.	No
12653	They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.	Yes
17352	And they want an American foreign policy that leads to a safer world.	No
21495	Thank God, the networks have a fact check so I don't need to go blue in the face anymore.	No
14818	I've seen four wars in my life.	No
31984	His was what he's done to women.	No
8027	I firmly believe that we should do so in Formosa and I believe that we should honour our commitments to all the countries we have guaranteed security.	No
2703	"But in the end, part of a principle, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what you intend to do, not just say, ""I'm going to sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	No
22373	Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	No
13240	And I can only say that I am very proud that President Eisenhower has restored dignity and decency and, frankly, a good formulation of the conduct of the United States presidency.	No
17406	When we took up our duties, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many dangers, safety deficiencies, that we stopped buying additional land until we corrected that with what was supposed to be a five-year program -- but it's almost over -- a billion dollars.	Yes
12735	Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	No
14233	And the average citizen here works hard every day.	No
335	I want to see - when I spoke at our congress about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the huge number of shelters and organizations that help.	No
5558	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	No
13595	But my plan is to get away from the trickle-down economy, just cut taxes on the richest Americans and get out of the way.	No
33527	"Look at the ""start"" they signed."	No
32543	You see, I understand the tax code better than anyone who comes to the chair.	No
7083	There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	No
15236	The coal which the President has spoken of - yes, we have - yet one eighth of our total coal resources is not being used at all now.	Yes
8067	Now that means the best leadership.	No
297	And I think I'm more in touch with the American public.	No
13193	And by the way, Senator Johnson was one of those who rejected this position - they voted with the seventy against the twelve.	Yes
32241	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	No
16781	I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.	Yes
1915	My priority is putting people back to work in America.	No
17394	I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	Yes
26079	And I hope we have a chance to talk more about it.	No
19492	The President is not quite right.	No
2903	So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	No
26659	But I'm very -- this is one of the real successes here of the work we've done.	No
19733	I want to be very serious.	No
3812	And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.	No
15432	It is a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open government, the work is very rewarding.	No
27104	And on behalf of the governor, you helped us enter Libya and the coalition we organized.	Yes
29990	And we recently learned that, you know, it's one of their favorite methods of trying to wreak havoc and gather information.	Yes
1848	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	No
23618	I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	No
13316	We can't have it in our hearts.	No
24	You need to know more about the users.	No
16149	And I believe that the answer to the agricultural economy is not to involve the government more, but to do what I propose.	No
3091	But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	No
28842	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	No
23926	Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	No
21934	I want to think they'll be able to afford an education.	No
16956	It is important for our future, economic security, that this work be non-political and separate from the executive and legislative branches.	No
26977	Of course, I disagree with what the President said about my own file and the things I said.	No
25969	That's what drug it out.	No
5983	And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	No
25043	He said these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could call them back if you decided there was a calculation error.	Yes
19117	I have three very special people with me tonight: my wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who never let me down, and a guy named Frank Carafa from New York, with Ollie Manninen who helped me in the mountains of Italy a few years ago.	No
28948	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	Yes
24204	This country desperately needs an employment programme, and my first priority would be to pass an employment programme, to present it on the first day I was inaugurated.	No
20838	They went to Austin High School.	No
29389	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	No
19116	I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	No
18679	The world is more dangerous.	No
22016	And you can't just go upstairs and say I'm gonna fix it.	No
6255	Of course, we have to get together.	No
10128	But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	No
22486	This year, my State ranks first in the country in terms of employment growth, fourth in manufacturing in terms of employment growth, fourth in income growth, and fourth in terms of poverty decline.	Yes
10072	And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	No
301	I'm not questioning his patriotism.	No
10961	As you can see, he's starting to talk about the government.	No
21921	But they must have a strong base economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and a chain around you.	No
17360	They want to go back to science, and they want a President-led policy that helps bridge the widening gap between the United States, Europe and Japan.	No
761	And since that action, terrorist action against American citizens has diminished.	Yes
17352	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	No
33228	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	Yes
6452	We're proud to be here.	No
2889	Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	No
17017	On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.	No
11531	But the fact is that it was the situation that remained when I got there.	No
16456	And I think it would be, uh - it would be, uh, easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong inflationary pressures that it would be necessary.	No
17745	I'm going to give the President some credit.	No
29566	So if he paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for veterinarians, zero for schools or health.	No
7991	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	Yes
19833	This will be a great opportunity for many people.	No
14135	I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	No
4408	I don't think one of us can say that our position in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	No
15540	The Vice President talks about national security.	No
25570	Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	No
17445	I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	No
21400	Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.	Yes
21365	I ask everyone to look at my economic ideas and nine Nobel laureates and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including many Republicans said, that's how you have to go.	Yes
28494	And I supported the biggest salary increase in several years, and I support another one now.	Yes
15971	Republican governors and democratic governors.	No
28173	Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	Yes
19459	We should keep the weapons out of the hands of criminals.	No
1717	I want to give tax relief to companies that invest here in the United States.	No
22998	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	No
676	What we are talking about is a combination of strong, effective and credible nuclear deterrence.	No
11155	Senator McCain suggests that, in a way, you know, I'm green behind my ears and, you know, I just die, and he's sober and responsible.	No
21932	I love my grandchildren...	No
9440	Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	Yes
6562	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	No
12273	People care a lot about their land and their environment.	No
9742	And I think it's a mistake.	No
17148	I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	No
15153	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	No
23886	They're right.	No
6850	Let me give you an excellent example.	No
15454	This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	No
3673	With all due respect, you've already given them to the oil companies.	Yes
17896	Will we be better off if we begin this escalation of star wars in the heavens?	No
14031	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	Yes
845	So, judge the man on his file not on the pile of rumors and Innuendo and try to cheat around with his name.	No
15008	And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	No
8593	The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	Yes
28202	In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	No
25505	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	Yes
20711	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	No
6842	We're starting to do it.	No
15199	He calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can pose a threat to each other.	No
29408	She tells us how to fight ISIS.	No
17208	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	No
26970	You said that we should not adopt nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted in their favour.	Yes
8421	Now, why should we ask ourselves whether the federal government is helping teachers pay their salaries?	No
894	I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	No
15894	We took the child to New York.	No
13105	Von Fremd, it would be totally irresponsible for a presidential candidate, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	No
20310	If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	Yes
9038	And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.	No
1520	If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.	No
19101	Now let's move on to the tax cuts for children's education and education, help with medical emergencies, and buy a home.	No
3617	I can tell you, it's rife.	No
18911	I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	No
16999	We must restore the faith and confidence of the American people in their own government.	No
3341	One of the most embarrassing failures of the Ford administration, which is specifically related to human rights, is its refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, go to Laos, go to Cambodia and try to exchange information on missing persons in these wars.	Yes
5674	And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	No
18834	There's nothing wrong with that.	No
14837	And with each of these decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	No
24254	And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	No
28847	Are you for this without quotas?	No
15209	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each of the railway cars, you would have a TNT load - a TNT train load extending across this nation.	Yes
21728	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	Yes
9279	I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	No
15022	Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.	Yes
18364	And I honor their sacrifices.	No
11860	And as we become a diverse society, we will have to tackle it more and more.	No
27218	I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	No
14252	And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	Yes
17446	Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.	No
12907	But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	Yes
5852	And what's important is to make sure we don't agree without being unpleasant.	No
8767	It will cause a shortage in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one by the American Petroleum Institute itself, which, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere towards the end of this decade, total global oil demand will simply exceed the total supply available.	Yes
3172	We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.	Yes
14154	He didn't fail to serve.	No
6492	We are doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	No
8607	In 1935, when the Social Security Act was drafted, ninety-four Republicans out of ninety-five voted against it.	Yes
32772	There are many very important plans under way, and some of them are to point out to the Sunnis of the region, as well as to the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we must all participate in them.	No
7605	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	Yes
142	And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	No
33222	And I regret it, because what I would like to see is that people come together and say: Of course, we will protect and defend the second amendment.	No
16630	When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	Yes
24417	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	No
29559	Then you have to ask yourself, why won't he publish his tax returns?	No
34269	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	No
18293	And that's what I did with that vote.	No
16404	I want to lean on that.	No
13327	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	No
12046	The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	No
12850	The Soviet Union does understand strength.	No
18408	So what I'm trying to do is tell the truth to the American people and the whole world.	No
12818	I do not think that we can wait for the next president to be inaugurated and then - choose a new team and then every month of negotiations that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, in collaboration with the current president, President Eisenhower - for breaking the Soviet filibustre.	No
12240	We have to be bold.	No
28498	You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	Yes
23483	Any action taken against terrorists requires a court order, control.	No
11914	We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	No
25684	I want to thank my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank people who listen and look all over America.	No
9147	And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	No
32215	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	Yes
22859	Secondly, of course, we were involved with Iran.	No
27280	And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	No
22084	Number 2, with respect to social security, this program -- many of you may not know -- produces a $70 billion surplus per year.	Yes
15911	(Applause) And I think it must be the woman, in the exercise of her conscience and religious beliefs, who makes this decision.	No
20148	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	No
29786	We need to have more second chance programs.	No
26127	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	No
19459	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	No
18358	Secondly, when we entered, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	Yes
11976	And I think that's how it should be.	No
32379	They never supported a presidential candidate.	Yes
26828	I promise you the economy is going to get better.	No
29274	He doubled it in almost eight years, seven and a half years, to be semi-exact.	Yes
16769	For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	Yes
29116	Let's make sure we have affordable child care and a debt-free college.	No
3684	There are some things that I think have to be done.	No
19238	But it was simply wrong to finance their last plan to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it wilting on the vine.	No
1124	I firmly believe, Mr Kraft, that it is not wise for a President to indicate in advance the options he might consider if an international problem arises.	No
32469	But you wouldn't change it, because all these people gave you the money so you could make negative ads about Donald Trump.	Yes
13236	One thing I have noted as I have travelled in the country is the huge number of children who come to see the presidential candidates.	No
12953	Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	Yes
26120	We have this country in the right direction.	No
17917	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments: ""We are tall, but we can be taller."""	No
12646	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	Yes
19634	When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.	Yes
32268	If they don't, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	No
3081	So strong economy is very important.	No
18119	He believes, as I believe, that Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	No
14981	And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	No
16097	I don't want the federal government to allow grandmothers.	No
20789	Let me give you some specific examples.	No
575	But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.	No
1665	And housing started to grow.	Yes
24911	A President is called the Commander in Chief.	No
25693	Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	No
914	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	No
24304	We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.	No
13350	This is a difficult and delicate question.	No
299	You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.	No
22315	There are nine countries that spend more than we do on public education.	Yes
29041	The biggest private property in the house, but I'll make a promise here.	Yes
18550	That's what we have to do.	No
15004	I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.	No
909	But I also think that we need an agricultural policy that does not cost us between 15 and 20 to 25 billion dollars a year and that has been costing us for three or four years under this administration.	Yes
24103	I don't think it's fair to slap a 50 cent gallon tax on people who have to drive to live, people who go long distances.	No
12553	It can and will grow even more in the next four years.	No
14754	"The ""we"" is you and me."	No
26731	The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.	No
2810	Even the Republican platform criticized Ford's lack of leadership and criticized the foreign policy of that administration.	Yes
24098	We've got to invest and grow.	No
14707	I just think it's time to change.	No
23684	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake in Iraq?"""	No
28612	I would like our farmers feeding the world.	No
17188	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the elections, so that the American people can participate in this decision.	No
7667	And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	No
24699	And just remember this, folks.	No
14932	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share the rarity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing things with less.	No
22860	I fully understand the threat.	No
23249	He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	No
4007	Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	Yes
582	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.	No
1936	Number two is to cut spending.	No
7973	In this administration, we arrested them in Quemoy and Matsu; we arrested them in Indochina; we arrested them in Lebanon; we arrested them in other parts of the world.	Yes
24162	I can't handle this in a minute, but I hope we can get back to it later.	No
26811	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	Yes
17088	In fact, it is the economic recovery programme that we presented when I took up my duties in 1981.	Yes
28404	If you want someone who believes that we were better than eight years ago and that we should go back to the kind of policies we had at the time, focusing on tax cuts mainly for the rich, here's your man.	No
19482	The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	Yes
33967	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	Yes
9029	And I noticed that everyone who's for abortion is already born.	No
20680	This is one of the top priorities of my administration.	No
7992	And he defined it as someone who uses beans instead of meat.	No
13516	Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	Yes
24240	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulating them.	No
25422	We must be hard on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	No
19860	I have been a strong force for reform.	No
26934	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	Yes
2215	So they don't have to pay any extra money, no extra $6,000.	Yes
17234	We must see the facts before we can draw any conclusions from them.	No
12212	We're working hard to sign up children.	No
24743	A few days ago, a bipartite commission of Republicans and Democrats - more Republicans than Democrats - declared that my plan would save the average family $1200 per year more than the Bush plan by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion over the next 12 years, $400 billion per year by the end of this decade.	Yes
15929	So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.	No
10906	You know who voted against it?	No
16560	It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	No
23311	Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	Yes
5547	He looked at some of Senator McCain's announcements.	No
20616	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	No
29562	Secondly, he may not be as charitable as he claims.	No
29528	And in a way, I should complain.	No
27360	And then, in a way, you will also face the deficit we already have.	No
31933	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	No
12472	The warning signs are clear.	No
23447	And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	No
24291	We must help Russia succeed in its revolution and in all its republics.	No
25234	But it takes more than that.	No
27758	The Secretary of Defense called these trillions of dollars in cuts to our devastating soldier.	Yes
17758	I would like the President to say: Yes, the CBO is right.	No
24280	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	No
538	That's the problem I have with the big Liberals spending.	No
13818	You've got to free up the private sector.	No
18712	And I understand that in some capitals of the world, it was not a popular gesture.	No
2235	And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	No
6790	"Faith without works is dead. """	No
16176	I am for clean water.	No
18111	The greatest disaster that could happen is that we are not succeeding in Iraq.	No
21151	It's not good for the country and it's not good.	No
724	And second, with regard to the Coast Guard Cup, the Controlled Democratic Congress, so please help us with that, which cut $70 million from the Coast Guard from the narcotics ban effort.	Yes
8234	It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
22708	I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	No
3428	And you're wondering, how that's gonna affect me?	No
13602	On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	Yes
13729	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, I ran a small grocery store around the corner, so I'm extrapolating that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	No
18123	And our alliance is strong.	No
18193	I don't think we want to know how he's gonna pay for all these promises.	No
18018	That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.	No
20439	I congratulate you for supporting this.	No
7594	Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	No
18989	Because China is also interested in the outcome.	No
14011	I thought we were gonna have the same time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other two.	No
13678	Let me remind you that this was a democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I followed.	Yes
9603	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	No
20129	Many people deserve to be rewarded, Mr. President.	No
27175	The former Joint Chief of Staff said Admiral Mullen said our debt was the greatest threat to national security.	Yes
20321	The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	No
3008	These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	No
12134	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	No
14160	I feel very strong about the people who are fighting for our country.	No
2952	In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the Secretary of State for the Vatican - I cannot under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would accept by signing this agreement which the thirty-five nations have handed over to the nations of the Warsaw Pact the domination of Eastern Europe.	Yes
13099	As far as Berlin is concerned, there is no question about the need to defend Berlin; the rights of people to be free there; and there is no question about what the United American people - Republicans and Democrats - would do in case the Communists try to take control of Berlin.	No
21507	I'm not interested in his character.	No
22306	Now I think we should try to help families and see if that will do what I think -- make all schools better.	No
1666	But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.	No
6018	And I need -- we need education and training programs for displaced workers who work, going to our community colleges.	No
22259	Everyone told me they were profitable.	No
2224	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	No
30054	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	Yes
29374	I'm very proud of that.	No
8965	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	Yes
23204	We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	Yes
14913	Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	Yes
26184	You're almost not old enough to remember this.	No
28149	And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	No
7344	I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	No
26825	And I'll make you a promise, my word is good.	No
16974	Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	No
29668	I'll give you an example.	No
18173	And there are a long list of thing.	No
25864	What service are you in?	No
5853	And that means that we can have tough and vigorous debates on the issues.	No
8166	I think our generation of Americans has the same date.	No
1127	It's a fact they did.	Yes
6099	You won't pay a fine, because...	No
28637	And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	No
7765	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	Yes
13084	And so on this issue I do not think there is any doubt in the minds of an American; I hope there is no doubt in the minds of a member of the West Berlin community; I am sure there is no doubt in the minds of the Russians.	No
8791	But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.	No
7868	President Eisenhower leaves on 20 January and the next four years are crucial years.	No
1253	That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.	Yes
28371	And so, rich people will get it.	No
8425	We need higher teachers' salaries.	No
8826	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.	Yes
6140	I want you to be able to choose health care for you and your family.	No
9454	No tax on your savings.	No
12520	And so, if we want to have peace, we need to know how to deal with the communists and their leaders.	No
11700	First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.	No
9970	I don't check it so often.	No
16990	It's a time for unity.	No
12138	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	Yes
4372	They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	Yes
24435	I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	No
9999	And it's time for them to take it seriously.	No
7911	Otherwise, if we find that the heads of State meet and do not progress, we will find that the cause of peace has been injured rather than aided.	No
8574	Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.	Yes
1009	I believe that the American people, if they had the leadership I expected to give, would be prepared to give this impetus to preserve the peace and restraint needed at home to keep the veil on spending so that we can, I think, have a tax cut expected and fully justified for middle-income people.	No
856	I think the American people have the right to judge us on this issue, on how we have chosen a race companion, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	No
30075	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are going up the volume and really working hard.	No
7820	On the other hand, we found that the bill had entered into legislative difficulties and, as a result, no action has been taken.	Yes
29164	I think that trade is an important issue.	No
16687	We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.	Yes
12465	Too many unresolved problems remain.	No
33386	I voted for border security, and there are...	Yes
23788	The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	No
11766	I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	No
28318	They put about, you know, 60% of the ropes where you have to fill the paperwork.	Yes
8619	If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	No
9191	And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	No
29500	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	No
13741	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	No
13886	You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	No
350	I'd say around 30 percent.	No
32344	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	No
24289	I hope we can talk more about that.	No
3667	Again, you can look it up.	No
6290	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	No
27472	This is something that could only have been seen if all the other ways had been tried in their entirety.	No
25958	Cocaine use up 160 percent.	Yes
3465	But I want to highlight one point for all Americans tonight.	No
33092	His children are incredibly capable and dedicated, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	No
15454	This country doesn't need to be in shape.	No
199	But, George, that's no answer.	No
23542	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	Yes
12189	Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	Yes
14838	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	No
18238	And I hope it's as soon as possible.	No
26536	17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
1851	But according to Governor Romney's definition, there are a bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	Yes
14565	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
28401	It's not about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	No
21254	And we have a very important decision to make.	No
15688	And that's the kind of America I want.	No
33756	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	No
13837	General Motors' experience is therefore relevant.	No
2516	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.	No
24293	We've got to help them.	No
1023	These things can be done if we have the right vision, restraint and leadership.	No
16132	That's something we're paying now to have a safe retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a safe retirement.	No
1402	The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	No
20665	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we have tried all the other ways, if we are sure that military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportional to the benefits, we should get involved.	No
23872	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	No
2990	I would never say that food is an element of a trade embargo.	No
1552	We have peace with freedom.	No
25073	Your definition of national force is to throw money into the Department of Defense.	No
27629	And I say that because I know a lot of people who think we should brush our hands and leave.	No
26773	And we're all proud of it.	No
27329	The good news is (inaudible).	No
27601	"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	No
11954	I'm not sure where he's coming from.	No
24154	Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.	No
7029	He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	No
963	They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	No
19456	You don't buy any gun.	No
437	Massachusetts's permission program was unique.	No
26613	In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.	Yes
24131	I would tell them to look at the recycling programmes we are proposing.	No
7800	Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	No
25951	Maybe -- they're probably addictive.	No
11328	I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	No
3956	Now, on the issue of aid to Pakistan, if you're targeting a weapon on someone, George Shultz, our great Secretary of State, once told me that you'd better be ready to pull the trigger.	No
14941	But we will have a very poor nation and a very bad economy if we follow this path.	No
19657	The President held it up.	Yes
30009	And I'm very proud of it.	No
26472	But I will return to the economic package because, once again, I think it is very important.	No
3224	On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	Yes
28333	There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	No
12622	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	No
20111	We cut taxes to 15 million working Americans again, and now I have a plan that's been here for two years, it could have already passed, but instead, the Republicans closed the government to try to force their budget and plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	Yes
25958	Cocaine consumes more than 160 percent.	Yes
2492	Actually, Governor, that's not what your plan does.	No
15603	He has raised taxes several times.	Yes
14055	But I don't -- I think you need to look at the integrity and honour of people who are lobbyized and those who are lobbyists.	No
15342	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	No
23630	I'm trying to decipher that.	No
28828	Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	No
13884	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	Yes
30052	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	Yes
22580	The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	Yes
17245	Thus, the whole question of what to do with social security has been resolved by bipartite legislation, and it is on a solid basis now as long as you can see in the next century.	Yes
16536	Keep my promises to the American people.	No
13229	If you'd pass that message on to him.	No
8313	I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.	No
19961	And I think you'll take a look at it.	No
26349	It was a tax credit for the employer.	No
34212	You should ask Bernie Sanders who he supports the presidency.	No
17998	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	No
27652	You know, I had lunch with some -- a Minnesota veteran who had been a doctor dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	No
15312	That's not true.	No
19517	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	Yes
25852	Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	Yes
2109	What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	No
22792	We didn't have enough forces.	No
29499	And we better be very careful.	No
19293	It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.	Yes
14660	The whole world has had economic problems.	No
24359	The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	Yes
821	Very serious errors of judgment have been made.	No
3582	Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	Yes
709	And spending billions and billions of dollars as Bush apparently wants, although he himself has been everywhere on this issue recently-on Star Wars-in my judgment has no meaning at all.	No
17126	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	No
27599	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	No
22496	We need to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	No
16640	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	Yes
2654	I propose that we class our schools so that parents know which schools succeed and fail, so that they can take their child to a school that he is more successful.	No
17847	Maybe I'm expected to ask the same question.	No
10611	I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	No
10543	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	No
15463	We have repaid $5.7 billion in tax refunds, credits and reductions to our people.	Yes
27786	But it can't go on.	No
22885	The all-volunteer army is working.	No
29701	So we have to do two things, as I said.	No
840	And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	No
14757	Together we can get anything done.	No
19888	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choices you had, and the kind of choices that many people have in America.	No
14518	Now, when you're out of Congress, you're really swinging.	No
19273	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	No
2452	And the fact is that when Obamacare is fully implemented, we will be able to show that costs will fall.	No
2839	I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	No
14662	And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.	No
16618	For example, we have completely revised our prison system.	No
1893	Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.	No
1585	We have almost become a welfare state.	No
1809	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	No
26465	Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	No
17553	What does this mean in real life?	No
28861	If you want to buy health insurance, you will get help with that.	No
5747	Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.	No
33221	They're throwing millions of dollars at me.	Yes
851	I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	No
32685	You don't even know who the rebels are.	No
2977	He also showed a weakness to yield to pressure.	No
5765	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	No
16594	I intend to do the same if I'm elected president.	No
22802	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	No
30186	And that's exactly what he did.	No
18941	Again, I cannot tell you how wrong it is, in my view, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
12397	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and my positions.	No
11877	The program that works and the voice must be an integral part of our reading program.	No
17143	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	Yes
8621	I want them to say that these are the years when the tide came; these are the years when the United States started moving again.	No
2571	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	No
1492	I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.	No
32215	And as I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	Yes
26213	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	No
2130	We're going to have to change the way it was by Ronald Reagan and the President -- the O'Neill Democratic President's Council.	No
3607	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	Yes
30410	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	No
14400	Then at the end of the war, when they had to testify about it, their stories were completely disconnected from what they said in August, September and October.	Yes
7906	I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	No
11970	Well, I have no idea.	No
32289	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	No
26766	We therefore want to put an end to discrimination.	No
879	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	No
11808	I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	No
23102	It's in my health care proposal.	Yes
20754	There's a big difference in this campaign.	No
4340	It's going to be critical.	No
9730	And what we have done when it comes to trade is not only to sign three trade agreements to open up new markets, but we have also set up a task force for trade that goes after anyone who benefits from American workers or companies and does not create fair conditions.	Yes
33949	I'm very proud of that.	No
2444	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	No
15410	But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	Yes
28348	We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	No
1668	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, turn to the rich and back down the rules, we'll be better.	Yes
29020	Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.	No
16751	In my energy independence program, we have increased, for example, solar energy research, from about $84 million per year to about $120 million per year.	Yes
7749	It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	Yes
5703	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	Yes
7972	In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	Yes
12977	I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	No
2368	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	Yes
8581	I fully agree with Senator Kennedy on this point.	No
15863	Thank you.	No
17762	It's going to go the other way, as they estimated.	No
25831	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	Yes
32465	Why didn't you change when you were a senator?	No
19309	I had a person in the oval office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	Yes
25001	I just thought that when I took office, it was time for a realistic discussion with and about the Soviet Union.	No
2336	That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	Yes
12704	They have to include the other countries of Latin America.	No
22116	And I think I have a good plan to help solve these problems at home.	No
723	Each of the joint chiefs will testify to the fact that the state of preparedness is at a high historical level.	No
29954	I don't think you can deny that.	No
22304	School choice -- public, private or religious.	No
7213	You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	No
25340	And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	Yes
2240	And that is why they supported the approach we adopted.	No
21866	You bought a front row seat and you are not satisfied with your health care and you say tonight that we have poor health care but very expensive health care.	No
14332	It's to the national honor.	No
15538	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a race companion.	No
19275	First of all, it is a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that President Clinton has defeated.	Yes
2990	I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.	No
12573	First, let me try to correct the file on the issue of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
34004	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	No
179	One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	No
8888	Now, the federal government will turn around and say, well, you have this problem; we will now give you the money to do it.	No
7133	And, America, it is one of those issues that separates the President and myself.	No
14673	I am focusing on the fact that we are always avoiding the issue of the Glaspie newspapers.	Yes
17983	We have pursued Al-Qaida wherever Al-Qaida is trying to hide.	No
32638	I would therefore go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have done today.	No
12110	They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.	No
7656	And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer, for example, to our attitude towards sit-in strikes.	No
34434	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	No
21179	People who occupy the highest position of the earth must be responsible for the decisions they make in life.	No
18605	The assessment of national intelligence that was given to the President in July said, better scenario, more the same as we see today; worse scenario, civil war.	Yes
11050	We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	Yes
6322	And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	No
1069	But on the other hand, on July 4 of this year, I found a new spirit born in America.	No
17800	Why deficits are a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone panicked about it, he said, no, he thought it should be more important, because a larger deficit would stimulate the economy and help eliminate unemployment.	Yes
33191	I understand and respect the tradition of possession of weapons.	No
33148	And I firmly believe that the Supreme Court must stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of powerful societies and rich people.	No
15757	I want the men and women of our armed forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	No
15529	And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	No
6908	I think they're gonna choose it, because it's a net over $5 billion for them.	Yes
21632	But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	No
1812	So there's no economist who can say that Mitt Romney's tax plan adds five trillion dollars if I say I'm not going to add to the deficit with my tax plan.	No
23370	The labels don't go, ladies and gentlemen.	No
29057	I think it's people's money.	No
16625	But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	No
20740	I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	No
24189	Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.	No
7426	I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	No
3888	That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	No
19466	The administration says they support instant control.	Yes
16577	And I plead for a grace for crooks.	No
14929	But this cannot hide the fact that there are eight million unemployed men and women in America today, and two million of those who have lost their jobs in recent months.	Yes
32514	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	No
25638	What they'll say about us in 100 years depends on how we keep our date with fate.	No
16322	and has to do what he's talking about now.	No
32971	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	No
15314	Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.	No
5943	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	No
22230	The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.	Yes
24500	Our funding for recovery is on the rise, recovery of drug addicts.	Yes
20874	Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	No
27171	But in order for us to promote these principles of peace, we must be strong.	No
24649	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	No
26001	First of all, there are two different things.	No
13413	But we can and must go faster, and that is why I am so firmly committed to programs that will advance America in the 1960s, move it forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	No
860	And in fact, I think for most people, the notion of President Quayle is a very disturbing thought.	No
15728	We are not going to spend billions on MXs on railway cars, which is a system of weapons that we do not need, cannot afford and will not help our defence posture at all.	Yes
26210	And he stands here and says that politicians making promises like that should be ignored.	No
33747	I have fought against that as a senator.	Yes
19244	In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	No
2334	That's why I'd have regulation.	No
18152	First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	Yes
443	But when a drug dealer comes in and kills a cop, I think he should pay with his life.	No
12111	Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	Yes
7809	The other point I would like to raise with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States should not simply do so here.	No
12042	"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."	No
8160	Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbour in Latin America because he was a good neighbour in the United States.	No
17118	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	No
21620	If you had a veto, you could shoot down the pig.	No
26655	We have concluded trade agreements with Japan.	Yes
20819	We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.	No
2479	This is the private market.	No
20517	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what she thinks she has to do.	No
4168	I've known him for 35 years.	No
630	And I think I got this.	No
13459	If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	No
18854	I'm trying to put a leash on them.	No
7697	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	No
911	And thanks to Congress, we now have a farm credit bill that helps and improve the situation with at least some of our farmers.	Yes
13413	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	No
26630	Did you say you're unemployed?	No
3998	And therefore, we have lost our legitimacy in Pakistan.	Yes
3995	We could allow our troops to be defensive and absorb these blows over and over again, if Pakistan does not want to cooperate, or if we have to start making decisions.	No
27870	And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	No
3084	And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	No
13255	I noted, for example, by reading a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after his statement about regrets, that he made the statement that he thought these particular flights were flights that should not have occurred at that time, and the indication was how Mr. Khrushchev would have felt if we had had a flight over the unit, how we would have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had had a flight over the United States while he was visiting here.	No
11484	Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	No
16541	It seems to me that our current tax structure has too high rates.	No
19345	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	No
22845	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	No
747	We've got to treat it as international crime.	No
25636	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	No
34035	But I think they're going to see through it.	No
23208	And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	Yes
12981	And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	No
3107	Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	No
23904	I was 19 or 20 years old flying over an aircraft carrier and it shaped me to be commander-in-chief of the armed forces.	No
8744	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	No
32762	I do not think that American troops should have territory, which they would have to do as an occupying force.	No
12069	And that is where our society must be directed if we are to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	No
27173	Unfortunately, the economy is no stronger.	No
13902	In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.	Yes
24657	I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.	No
26817	We should protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	No
29933	Well, just listen to what you heard.	No
9652	In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	Yes
20677	The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	No
2930	The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	Yes
25640	You know, I thank you all for giving me the opportunity to serve you over the past four years, and I ask for re-election because I want more than anything to try to complete the new beginning we made four years ago.	No
22472	I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.	No
19095	Now there's a record: ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, declining crime rates and well-being rolls, a peaceful America.	Yes
16288	We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	No
20005	Two thirds of the worst toxic waste landfills are cleaned.	No
15588	No, I'm not sure I can promise, I don't think either of us can really do it.	No
24041	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure construction over the next 10 years.	Yes
12212	We work hard to register children.	No
20827	It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	No
28202	In the health insurance reform, I'm talking about it and I'm saying that if you're an elder, you can stay in health insurance if you like it, and that's good, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do it, just like they do federal employees.	No
7475	And some would say maybe me more so than others.	No
4377	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	No
21326	So I have just negotiated with the President of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the Prime Minister of Canada, I could add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are growing much faster than jobs that have moved abroad.	Yes
16362	I think that tells the American people a lot about the standards we will set and the quality of the people we will choose to serve in our administration.	No
32464	Well, why didn't she change it?	No
2026	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	No
21414	People -- high school graduates aged 18-24 10 years ago were doing more than they do now.	Yes
3373	We can be once again.	No
7806	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	No
22132	We have agreements, but they're still here.	No
4053	A testimony to you, Jim.	No
1484	Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	No
105	Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	No
23943	You doubted my patriotism.	No
24094	People work harder for less money than they did 10 years ago, 2- 3rd of our people -- a $1,600 drop in average income over the last two years.	Yes
9489	He had 60 minutes only two weeks ago and was asked: Is it just for someone like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or bus driver, someone making $50,000 a year?	No
16255	"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	No
26066	This places a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	No
7193	But let me go a little further.	No
17602	All these deductions are legal, deductible in the calculation of your tax, and it was a one-year history with him.	Yes
23385	And I just told you the facts, sir.	No
25903	I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	No
6912	You want to buy into it, you can.	No
15868	These are basic American values.	No
20612	But since they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the legitimate winner of the election, I am not sure that it is right for us to invite the President of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we may not like the results that result.	No
28190	We share a common border with another nation.	No
23249	He came to ask for a tax reduction -- we wanted a tax reduction to get the economy going.	No
11405	I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	No
10678	We will have to give priority, as a family must give priority.	No
11239	And some say that's what Putin wanted in the first place.	No
16250	I understand, after the Vice-President's debate, why Mr Bush would not want any more debates.	No
1056	Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.	Yes
3648	We had an energy bill in front of the United States Senate.	No
13175	And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	Yes
29791	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	Yes
7988	And I have a responsibility to correct it every time it makes a mistake; and I intend to continue to do so.	No
17503	And it's a personal and private moral judgment.	No
3653	You've got to look at our record.	No
3714	I know how to do that.	No
20453	I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	No
27160	I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	No
10563	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	Yes
13021	We're on the side of freedom.	No
28955	We both made promises in this campaign.	No
19149	I think the fundamental difference is, and I've had some experience in this, I think the fundamental difference, I trust people.	No
15374	That is why I believe that there will be millions of democrats voting with us this time, because they also want this promise to be respected.	No
17139	These people depend on us all for the little security they have, and I'm not gonna do it that way.	No
32831	But I'll tell you, she's all talking.	No
32437	I don't have any loans from Russia.	Yes
17583	From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	Yes
17011	I owe nothing to the particular interests.	No
31845	If we set these goals and go together to try to achieve them, there is nothing in my opinion that America cannot do.	No
27377	We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	Yes
13927	We cannot lose those jobs.	No
28662	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	No
16191	But I'm not going to do that.	No
636	We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.	Yes
11332	The same goes for Michelle, and I'm sure the same goes for many of you.	No
18964	And so I've told him my opinion.	No
19352	And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	No
8530	We have been concerned about communism in the United States in the past.	No
8660	Mrs Loomis, I think it is quite appropriate that the first question in this first debate on the '80 campaign concerns the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are really concerned about the low performance rate of the American economy over the last four years.	No
15593	That's not what we are going to do.	No
28741	And that is the current campaign financing system.	No
4404	My father came from Kenya.	No
24649	We need to give one person the responsibility for the fight against AIDS so that it affects all the agencies involved in it.	No
3765	Not only -- Even if we recover all the $700 billion, suppose markets are recovering, we hold enough assets for taxpayers to eventually recover it and what happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt bought a bunch of houses, over time, the house's values came back and the government actually made a profit.	Yes
34451	Our city centers are a disaster.	No
26942	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	No
32336	And we need to do our part.	No
32721	Let me tell you something.	No
22476	Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	No
34059	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	Yes
26093	Reduce the rate of capital gains.	No
26635	Reduce the rate of capital gains.	No
29698	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	No
29796	So there are things we can do, and we should do it in a bipartite way.	No
755	Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.	No
19856	I called for the expansion of the choice options for public schools and said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states finance.	Yes
25537	Mr. Mondale recently announced his plan to bring democracies together and work with the world to turn to democracy.	Yes
30244	He describes the problem well.	No
19897	But I want to go there and give all our children a better chance of education, and that's why I vetoed the budget that you adopted with $30 billion in cuts in education.	Yes
3786	So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	Yes
30076	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
32607	I mean, I think we should be allowed to...	No
25510	It is a great communist movement that takes control of the Philippines.	No
11815	Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	No
27408	And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	No
9048	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 small colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have in our power to start the world over again.	No
1522	So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
21417	And what's happened in the meantime?	No
4138	I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.	No
133	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	No
23172	He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	No
17911	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	No
10182	We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	No
17241	And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	No
18470	As the politics change, his positions change.	No
12877	But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	No
20566	It is likely that they would support Roe v. Wade.	No
14586	He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
290	I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	No
8205	What happened to you?	No
32414	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	No
14963	In California - I am surprised that Governor Reagan has spoken about this - he has had the three biggest tax increases in the history of this state under his administration.	Yes
8120	Are we as strong as we should be?	No
23483	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	No
19199	That's America.	No
13944	It tells you a little where taxes, year after year, have to come from.	No
19580	There are very few differences in the budget I have proposed and in the Republican budget over the next six years.	Yes
10310	Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.	No
3011	It's a matter of being consistent.	No
24104	I don't think we need to do it.	No
19181	In fact, women's wages fell by 2.2 per cent.	Yes
1730	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	Yes
22497	I entered this race because I didn't want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than his parents.	No
11013	And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	No
13405	That is why, in this whole area of civil rights, equal opportunities for employment and education are not only for the benefit of minority groups, it is for the benefit of the nation so that we can get scientists and engineers and everything else we need.	No
19476	And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	Yes
16273	I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	No
22124	And only the United States could do it.	No
2343	That is one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we have had.	No
8436	But I don't think the way to get more salaries for teachers is to get the federal government with a massive program.	No
12866	We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	Yes
23635	It's a way to reduce abortions.	No
12599	Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?	Yes
24265	These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.	No
15284	The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	No
27524	Bob, let me answer it.	No
6775	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	No
17879	"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	No
4405	That's where I get my name.	No
33399	But under Obama, millions of people have been displaced from that country.	Yes
29121	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	No
10440	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	No
22730	I meet with them all the time.	No
6552	It's called bait and switch.	No
11560	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	No
3257	He had ordered his representative to surrender to full Panamanian sovereignty over the Panama Canal area at the end of a certain period of time.	Yes
937	But there are two main focal points of this election.	No
17730	It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.	Yes
28294	I have already mentioned that local communities have more difficulty in passing bond issues.	No
9939	Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	No
29952	It doesn't work that way.	No
5611	I haven't made a promise about...	No
12020	He is for registration of guns.	Yes
26955	And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.	No
28459	I see a future where the world will be at peace, where the United States of America will defend the values of democracy, human rights and freedom all over the world.	No
30407	Where did you get this?	No
14094	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on one thing -- the first time he said something nice about this administration.	No
6304	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers with higher salaries in return for increased support.	No
8150	A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or milk producer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself from the forces of supply and demand in the market; but he can work together in effective government programs that he can do.	No
17126	In other words, it does not converge as suggested by the President.	No
24062	He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.	Yes
3149	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limits and capabilities of atomic energy.	No
24297	This is a very unstable situation.	No
24329	Well, we're still the envy of the world in terms of our military.	No
7475	And some might say more than others than I do.	No
4157	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	No
17210	I only want to hear arguments about whether it's good or bad for people -- is it morally right?	No
34281	So I think we could reach an agreement and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that it was something that we believe is in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us in our fight against ISIS.	No
8028	But I do not believe that this line in the event of war should be drawn on these islands, but rather on the island of Formosa.	No
3478	We haven't seen the language yet.	No
24952	Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.	No
1243	This has not been done, unfortunately.	No
11028	I have heard a lot of criticism about America, about our national security policy, and all this, and much of this criticism is justified.	No
23394	You wonder, Nikki, why people don't like us in some parts of the world.	No
20703	We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	No
26804	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	No
17149	And, in fact, the biggest tax increase in our country's history took place in 1977.	Yes
23990	I do not think that we should go back to Mondale's or Dukakis' proposals on taxes and expenditure.	No
21362	Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	No
22369	I hope a lot of...	No
571	The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	No
30256	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	No
33634	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	Yes
24451	I have seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	No
19095	Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	Yes
2018	Well, the economy continues to grow slowly.	Yes
310	Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	No
23636	My opponent voted against the ban.	Yes
28807	The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	No
11857	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to ensure that Arab Americans are treated with respect.	Yes
1212	I have added funds for the National Parks Service in the current year's budget.	Yes
2809	And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	No
33305	You have thousands of mothers, fathers and parents all over the country.	No
10660	My friends, we will not be able to provide the same benefits to the current workers as we are going -- that the current retirees have today.	No
20409	And in the long term, we need to provide new incentives for the development of domestic resources such as deep gas in the western Gulf, such as oil stripper wells, but also renewable energy sources.	No
5557	In fact, independent studies have examined our respective plans and have concluded that I grant three times as much tax relief to middle-class families as Senator McCain.	Yes
24672	"""Because we're going to get rid of them, and Congress will listen to people."""	No
33394	"He underpaid the undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what many employers do: ""You complain, I'll have you deported."""	Yes
23659	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	No
21873	You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.	No
25286	I am convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.	No
10094	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	No
17874	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	No
30163	When I had an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, the first time someone asked me that, I said very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	No
21609	And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	No
13703	So we've got to do that.	No
13712	Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.	Yes
14458	Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	No
24627	And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	No
2627	When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.	Yes
29933	Listen to what you heard.	No
3375	It should not be a bombardment and threat force.	No
33218	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	No
12332	And I believe that -- that we should recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking measures that preserve the environment in a way that is beneficial to them.	No
32818	African-Americans now 45 per cent of poverty in city centres.	Yes
9034	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that a woman is called upon to make is whether or not to carry a pregnancy in the long term.	No
10691	Senator McCain mentioned that she reviewed our files.	No
24000	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	No
7932	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	No
29128	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	Yes
33484	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	No
12081	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States in relation to any other country in the world, it seems to me quite obvious that if we respect the rights of hunters and athletes, we need common sense security measures to stem this flow of weapons coming into the wrong hands.	No
2399	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.	Yes
24614	So I think the call is yes, we care.	No
16140	That is where we should go, and these are the programmes that we should first look at.	No
21020	The key is vocational training, education, investments in health care and education, the environment, pension security.	No
32986	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	No
8225	Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	No
5826	We may have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we have a difference in health care policy, but we have a difference in health care policy.	No
12890	And yet, let us see what we have done for Poland, aid of half a billion dollars has been paid to Poland, mainly economic, mainly to go to the Polish people.	Yes
18261	And the reason he didn't, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	Yes
13262	For the very reason that these senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not tell the communists in advance that you are going to give up an area that is free.	No
27692	We haven't done that yet.	No
20735	I believe that the reform of social assistance must move to the next stage.	No
22902	We won't have a project until I'm the president.	No
15984	I wasn't there when this stock market let go of my hands and told me that it was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it's not the end of the world.	No
10257	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	No
33591	I want us to do more to help small businesses.	No
25970	Meanwhile, we started -- also in 1993 to see if cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit cigarette companies from advertising, marketing and distributing their products to our children.	Yes
28865	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	No
2329	So the question is: Does anyone think that the big problem we had was that there was too much monitoring and regulation of Wall Street?	No
26350	Instead of the federal government, we got this tax credit, cashing in some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement, it's a cost.	No
19995	You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	No
18262	And he said our troops would be occupants in a bitterly hostile country.	No
21107	But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	No
18819	I agree with my opponent that we should not hire troops.	No
1111	I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	Yes
24829	Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	No
33633	We have to say to Japan in a very nice way, we have to say to Germany, to all these countries, to South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us.	No
33069	But I also want to make sure we don't leave people behind.	No
24241	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits, as Mr. Bush did.	Yes
494	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people grow up in, and that brings me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	No
2920	This is a responsibility of the president.	No
12155	There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	No
13672	I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	No
24168	That is what I want to do.	No
13109	This is the history of dealing with dictators.	No
11903	Don't you realize we have a hate crime law?	No
27727	That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	Yes
1013	Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.	No
12818	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	No
25259	I know it'll be a surprise for Mr. Mondale, but I'm in charge.	No
19668	Maybe we bit more than we could chew, but we're continuing a step-by-step reform now.	No
24699	And don't forget that, guys.	No
6056	If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	Yes
11724	Our army is supposed to fight and win the war.	No
10908	I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.	No
15053	With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.	Yes
28635	I'm in a big farm condition.	No
9666	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everyone participates and women get the same good business as men.	No
21312	There is no environmental control, no pollution control and no retirement.	No
14601	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	Yes
15389	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	Yes
27573	But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	No
13477	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	No
5857	Bob, you asked me a direct question.	No
23226	He's the first president to lose his job in 72 years.	Yes
27583	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	No
6255	Of course, we have to come together.	No
2582	That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	No
262	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	No
34293	But I just have to...	No
5574	We're not doing this in my administration.	No
3265	I might even be prepared to reduce to some extent our military deployments in the Panama Zane Canal, but I would not give up the practical control of the Panama Zane Canal at any time in the foreseeable future.	No
18455	My opponent just said something extraordinary.	No
25617	I thank the Women's Voting League, the panelists, the moderator and the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	No
2317	You had people borrowing money to buy a house they couldn't afford.	No
21458	It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	No
29441	Because we have -- we have a president who can't sit around a table and get them to approve something.	No
29263	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	No
11663	And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	No
19808	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against the creation of the Ministry of Education.	Yes
13225	They may - are not my style.	No
28304	And once again, I want to allow all middle-class families to send their children to university and more Pell grants for those in low-income groups too, and then I want to make sure that we have vocational training in addition to that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with teachers in public schools.	No
25066	And he even opposed President Carter when, towards the end of his term, President Carter wanted to increase the defence budget.	Yes
9878	I'm not gonna put lovers on for people who come here illegally.	No
16786	And yet, it condemns the vetoes that I have made - which saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	Yes
32013	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	No
17897	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	No
6253	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	No
10363	The president said he would.	No
5998	And what I said was that we should include them and make them enforceable.	No
6342	Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.	No
11643	I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	No
21857	I think it's a good program.	No
26466	That would be my answer to that question.	No
28833	This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	No
23549	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find remedies.	Yes
27685	But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	No
20317	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	No
28497	I think it would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we have succeeded in Kosovo, Bosnia and Haiti and elsewhere is to have the technological advantage.	No
16794	Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	Yes
26059	But at the same time, if you want to leave Medicare, return to the general public, we will provide jobs.	No
26753	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	No
8285	We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	Yes
19292	We worked too hard to lower it.	No
24162	I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.	No
32936	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
6660	What I can promise you is that I will make the rules of the game as fair as possible, that I will make sure, for example, that with regard to the tax system, you as a worker in America do not subsidize the loss of your job.	No
20342	Let me give you one quick example.	No
8020	To leave this in the air, that we will defend it under certain conditions, but not in others, I think it is a mistake.	No
28512	Soldiers need to understand why we're leaving.	No
23482	As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.	No
25716	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	No
21925	I think the national debt affects everyone.	No
15280	If it is well known that I am opposed to California's air pollution laws, the only thing I can think of is that the president must suggest the law that the federal government has tried to impose on the state of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive a car within the limits of a Californian city, or to have a place to put it if you have driven it against their regulations.	Yes
30040	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	No
26500	Well, one thing I did was to oppose the government's assumption of health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we feared that what you mentioned would happen.	Yes
8118	If we fail, then freedom fails.	No
6224	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	No
23762	I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	No
514	I know what strong political leadership is.	No
25013	So, I can say there are a great many interests.	No
29884	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	No
20092	But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	No
33742	I'll be against it when I'm president.	No
16990	It's unit time.	No
29132	They are devaluing their currency, and there is no one in our government to fight them.	Yes
24441	I think we should strengthen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we should ask ourselves whether we should lift the arms embargo that is currently being imposed on Bosniaks, because they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed adversary who was dealing with ethnic cleansing.	Yes
30274	I looked at it the other night.	No
17026	I think the real problem in this campaign, and what you have to decide on the second of November, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years' time at the White House.	No
33761	Let me ask a simple question.	No
15018	This has been a very successful effort.	No
18533	I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	No
23488	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because some parts of the FBI could not talk to each other.	Yes
30207	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	No
30119	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should ask -- we defend them, and they should at least pay us what they're supposed to pay by treaty and contract.	Yes
74	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
26942	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	No
19269	Well, the people need it, that's the point.	No
16843	You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	Yes
21041	Today, 300,000 people are smaller than eight years ago.	Yes
13004	It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.	No
25942	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	Yes
7136	We do not have the right to vote.	Yes
10442	It hasn't worked out that way.	No
17015	And I believe that if we can take advantage of the enormous untapped reservoir of innate force in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest, strongest and best country on earth.	No
10144	And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	No
18787	For sanctions to be effective, we should have worked with the British, the French, the Germans and other countries.	No
3758	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	No
15260	The Department of Energy has a budget of more than $10 billion.	Yes
24344	But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	No
12364	We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	No
24320	Our dollar is at any time low in relation to certain foreign currencies.	Yes
23571	Let me give you some examples, I suppose, of the kind of person I wouldn't choose.	No
12407	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	Yes
8538	The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	No
15767	The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	No
16515	Well, actually there are.	No
27176	This -- we have weakened our economy.	Yes
23111	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	Yes
5775	And it is a question of fact that Senator Obama spent more money on negative announcements than any political campaign in history.	Yes
16625	But efficiency, simplicity, and the ability of people to understand and control their own government was a substantial benefit of a complete reorganization.	No
30340	At the moment, it is becoming more and more difficult to defeat them, because they are increasingly in places, more and more states, more and more nations.	Yes
13428	This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	Yes
3807	And I want to tell you that now that we succeed and our troops will return home, not in defeat, we will see a stable ally in the region and an emerging democracy.	No
16198	Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.	No
4003	Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	No
12637	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	No
28793	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	No
16998	The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.	No
7707	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	No
34113	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	No
15262	And so that Mr. Carter suggests that I want to remove the safety laws and those that relate to clean water and clean air, and so on.	No
2332	Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	No
19153	Don't forget that, it happened in 1993.	Yes
3496	But -- but let me point out, I also cautioned against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and cautioned against greed and excess business, and against CEO compensation, and all that.	No
13264	Because they know that Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do, you will encourage them to become more aggressive.	No
8039	It is not the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	No
16189	Come on, give me five.	No
21508	I want to change the character of the presidency.	No
1369	I think a limited approach to the issue would be... desirable, and - and I think, appropriate.	No
314	My parents came to this country as immigrants.	No
23069	You know what he did?	No
18157	No, the way to win is to be firm and resolved and follow the plan I just described.	No
16572	Well, I think it's... very difficult for President Ford to explain the difference between President Nixon's pardon and his attitude towards those who violated the bill.	No
14566	If the money does not come to pay for these programs, we will reduce other government spending or we will slow down the gradual introduction of programs.	No
21605	And I need everyone's help across this country to make it go through Congress in a substantial way.	No
7911	Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	No
9010	I think this is a moral issue that should be left to the individual's freedom of conscience.	No
34428	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	No
25531	But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.	No
1172	I'd say, several hundred of them.	No
757	Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	Yes
15501	You see, I think some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so scandalous, and I would say especially those that cause the death of a police officer, for these really brutal crimes, I believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I think we need it.	No
25924	When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and bring them together and they spoke alone for three hours, I was convinced that they should have a chance to make that peace.	Yes
14418	But let's look where I think the real mistake was made.	No
15516	He had two terms in the Congress.	No
4323	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	No
1942	I want to cut spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	No
8686	Now I know that it was called inflationist by my opponent and by the man who is not here tonight.	No
4257	And I must say, Senator McCain and myself, that I agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of examining a matter.	No
24825	This debate tonight has highlighted a challenge as old as America - the choice between hope and fear, change or more, the courage to enter a new tomorrow or listen to the crowd that says things could be worse.	No
13679	And I said I make a mistake.	No
12081	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	No
2497	This is the largest expansion of private insurance.	Yes
3105	It now stands at five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
10562	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with the owners to make sure they can stay in their house.	No
21321	We got to cut it out.	No
24134	I mean, we have big economic problems, but we're not going to split up, we're ready for a recovery.	No
12893	Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	No
2294	It's the biggest kiss I've ever seen at New York banks.	No
17445	I believed that in appointing the judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	No
16770	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	Yes
24408	It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.	Yes
29	Everybody ought to be in this thing.	No
3622	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after asking for $932 million in pork bar bill projects.	Yes
22902	We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.	No
22649	I always thought he was a threat.	No
26362	I only have 30 seconds.	No
25315	Georgie Anne, we, I believe, strongly supported Bill Simpson-Mazzoli -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	Yes
18364	And I honor their sacrifices.	No
17746	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	No
2063	And part of the way we do it is not to grant tax relief to businesses that ship jobs abroad.	No
25823	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	No
6037	And Detroit had dragged his feet too long for that to happen.	No
7804	We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	No
3716	And we fixed it and we killed it and people ended up in federal jail, so I know how to do it because I've been involved in these problems for many years.	Yes
21579	I made the commitment we would make.	No
17909	These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	No
3601	And I pay for every dime of it.	No
25800	First of all, let me say what we have done.	No
10119	Most recently out in Aurora.	No
9045	We landed on this east bank, and then went to the mountains, meadows, deserts and distant mountains from the west to the Pacific, building cities and farms, schools and churches.	No
12075	But I'm very convinced of that.	No
844	And he has my full confidence and he will have the trust of the people who are in their 30 â ¬s and 40 â ¬s and more.	No
24321	We are weak in the world.	No
21398	I do not think that would stimulate any kind of growth.	No
16013	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	No
15333	I preferred the other bill and thought it would be better for the elderly and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	No
15581	No, we need a head of the executive who is ready to lead; who will not blame Congress; who will lead to reducing this deficit, who will make difficult choices about spending.	No
661	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is that wheat will happen in Eastern Europe.	No
8750	So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.	No
17992	We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	No
20558	I have just told you the criteria on which I will appoint judges.	No
25227	A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	No
23314	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	Yes
11732	That's what we did in Haiti.	No
24843	Take a look at the Middle East.	No
11579	If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	No
8294	Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	No
29226	We wish you a lot of luck.	No
12847	The Soviet Union refused to accept this, and we went to the top and it was disastrous.	Yes
33424	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	No
29800	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	No
19372	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	Yes
5855	And this has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	No
15965	And that is totally unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	No
3943	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where no one had anything to do with September 11 before entering, where, in fact, there was no Al-Qaida before entering, but we have four times more troops there than in Afghanistan.	Yes
7914	I have no disagreement with the Vice-President's position on this.	No
18774	Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.	Yes
33324	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	No
12467	I would like to unite this country to make a programme that will talk about the hopes and aspirations of the future.	No
17180	Now, for three times, one after the other, our embassies were attacked in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	Yes
32589	You know, under our Constitution, the presidents have something called the veto.	No
13174	He forgets that in the same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted - what he did - he voted against an amendment, or was registered against an amendment - and on that particular point - or on an amendment, I would say - which adopted the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	Yes
28776	There's a man in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	No
17386	We did it, 25% on the whole.	Yes
29610	And the reason I'm saying it's not a way to brag.	No
16769	For example, as I said, we have added some four million jobs over the past seventeen months.	Yes
12927	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	Yes
17211	And on this basis and on this basis alone, we make a decision on each issue.	No
34143	Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	No
33309	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	Yes
2532	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	No
15809	I agree with the governor on athletics.	No
24715	And I think that's how you cut the deficit, not through the tax and expenditure program that we hear every four years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, or anyone else.	No
25989	No one should smoke, young or old, but especially young people should not smoke, but my file is here.	No
22179	It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.	Yes
7999	Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	No
25991	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	No
14685	They don't want us to talk about each other.	No
22142	If I can get you to defend myself and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	No
8088	It's the importance of the party, only if it talks about the file.	No
582	That's not how you deal with the Soviets.	No
7950	Well, I think we should be no - without any illusions as to what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the 1960s.	No
367	And while I am all about Bill McKinney, that, in itself, will simply not do so.	No
7811	We must not meet the communists only in the field of raw atheistic materialism.	No
12462	Jim, thank you very much.	No
26149	You should expect this from both of us.	No
33940	Why don't you give back the money?	No
24677	So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --	No
9986	His best immigration advisor is the guy who designed Arizona's law, the whole one; not E-Verify, the whole one.	Yes
15489	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had in recent years, even though the Vice-President was at least supposedly responsible for this war.	No
15263	As the Governor of California, I have taken over the passage of the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been passed in the United States.	Yes
6923	The Lewin report is a group of people who are not politically affiliated.	No
1566	But our country is innately very strong.	No
16496	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	No
12607	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact and yet, when the Iraqi Government was amended, the Baghdad Pact was broken.	Yes
557	I think that's one of the things Mr Bush said about Mr Reagan in 1980.	No
17553	What does that mean in real life?	No
3283	But let me comment on the report.	No
8202	We often hear about gross national product and, in this regard, I can say that when we compare the growth of this administration with that of the previous administration, there has been a total growth of 11 per cent over seven years; in this administration, there has been a total growth of 19 per cent over seven years.	Yes
14029	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	No
22414	No, but just let me stay with the American people in two and a half weeks, we're going to choose who should sit in this oval office, who is leading the economic recovery, who is the leader of the free world, who is lowering the deficit.	No
5507	We should put the owners first.	No
17037	The member of a union must have its rights strengthened and expanded and our children in their education should have the opportunity to improve according to their talents and abilities.	No
16970	So I think that in this case, as well as in the reorganization of intelligence agencies, as I did, we have to do by order-in-council.	No
28917	I'm proud that we're empowering people.	No
30216	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	Yes
11704	But one of the problems we have in the army is that we are in many places around the world.	Yes
23695	Now you've asked what mistakes.	No
8397	And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	No
25045	A president must know these things.	No
33687	He does not have the merit of taking very difficult positions.	No
30331	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	No
20168	I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	No
17350	They don't want this arms race.	No
9133	They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	No
18756	While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.	Yes
24985	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	No
26160	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience, and intelligence.	No
8498	Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.	No
28048	It is in fact a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this point, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartite bill, is a bill that I support and that the Governor does not.	Yes
16952	As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.	No
17856	The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.	Yes
17767	Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?	No
26057	You won't go without food and you won't go without medical care.	No
33632	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	No
11713	Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	No
28825	I know what a commitment to diversity means.	No
10249	We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	No
21118	That's what it is.	No
12683	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	Yes
25065	Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	No
26930	Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	Yes
31979	I am a person who has a great deal of respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	No
12769	I served this country for fourteen years in Congress and before that in the service.	No
22092	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	No
15958	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	No
12868	I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	No
6970	And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.	No
179	One thing I won't do is get all the companies in the country and, therefore, throw some people out of work.	No
28092	And I think I can.	No
18305	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	No
27751	We can work with them, we can work with them, if they are willing to be responsible.	No
5731	So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	Yes
23893	I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	No
18260	The president's father did not go to Iraq, to Baghdad, beyond Basra.	No
8621	I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	No
3186	The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	No
326	Not the labels we attach to each other, the questions about patriotism and the loyalty of the other.	No
18538	"You cannot wage the war on terrorism if you continue to change your position on the war on terrorism and say things like, ""Well, it's only a great diversion."""	No
26112	First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	No
8163	I want the people of Latin America, Africa and Asia to start looking to America; to see how we do things; to ask me what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese communists.	No
28220	One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	No
14164	I look on this as history.	No
20898	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	Yes
28166	I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	No
16860	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	No
12924	Well, Mr. Nixon, back in 1955.	No
21407	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	No
21251	I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.	No
29385	It can't... it can't stand.	No
28921	I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	No
7786	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	No
14971	The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	Yes
662	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	No
14587	He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
31981	But that was something that happened.	No
29175	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	No
33548	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	Yes
107	First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	No
21120	It's time to have a leader who doesn't push back tomorrow what we should do today.	No
26350	Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.	No
26633	And that's the economic package again.	No
11563	I hope that our European friends will become peacekeepers in Bosnia and the Balkans.	No
28448	We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	No
25704	I was going to applaud, too.	No
7425	I've reached across the aisle.	No
368	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.	No
4074	This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.	No
6056	If you have health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	Yes
20129	A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.	No
20131	I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	No
17178	There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.	No
21259	Because you are the ones who have the most time to pay taxes, the hardest time to make ends meet.	No
30243	It's a good one, though.	No
14863	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	No
29687	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	No
23710	That ammo is now being used against our kids.	No
19660	If you change your job, you'll be covered.	Yes
9679	I don't think so, Candy.	No
28188	And we have uninsured people in my state.	No
26401	Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.	No
17464	Only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision did the Federal Government intervene in what has always been a State policy.	Yes
4346	And it's the biggest country on Earth.	No
22283	You'll never spend less.	No
33644	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and elsewhere.	Yes
7309	And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	Yes
18954	No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	No
24804	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	Yes
32489	We're going to prosper again.	No
20112	But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	No
8155	I think we can do a better job.	No
4170	And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.	No
4332	That is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	No
1266	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	Yes
15310	That is the way it will stay.	No
13229	If you could give him that message.	No
25626	I remember driving down the California coast one day.	No
26637	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	No
121	If he continues, he will be Joe Isuzu of American politics.	No
34185	Chris, we're not making anything.	No
1920	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	Yes
6500	I don't really think about him very much.	No
8220	They just seem to retrace the programs of the Truman Administration that preceded it.	No
2340	Let me mention another rule in Dodd-Frank.	No
16185	I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	No
2368	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	Yes
27691	We will also need to put in place a more effective and comprehensive strategy to help the world move away from terror and Islamic extremism.	Yes
14729	We live in an interconnected world.	No
744	And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.	Yes
3069	We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.	Yes
29343	I wrote this in my book...	No
21741	Now, what this really means is that you can live -- we become so worried about the rights of the criminal that we have forgotten the rights of the innocent.	No
25011	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	No
12024	It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	No
19194	They talk about family income being up.	No
1169	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	No
5837	And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	No
14242	You want to have a new program in this country.	No
11827	But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.	No
19566	That would be my position.	No
17584	Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	No
17590	Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	No
9912	If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.	No
25199	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	No
11106	They're plotting to kill the Americans right now.	Yes
23609	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	No
6092	That's not the case, and I just described it...	No
2963	I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	No
13235	But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	No
8713	Fifteen months ago, he was a co-signator and advocated the tax reduction that I am proposing, and said that this would be a step forward in the fight against inflation, and that it would be beneficial for the workers in this country.	Yes
14276	And in that case, I am glad that we have done so, because if we had let the sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on this, Saddam Hussein would now be in Saudi Arabia controlling the global supply of oil, and he might be there with a nuclear weapon.	No
10139	And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	No
14517	But White House staff have increased their spending much more than Congress has done in the last four years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush has asked them to spend.	Yes
26430	For the first time in the 20th century, the president did this over the four years and that's why I don't want to see us make a big hole in the deficit with a tax program that we can't pay, so your interest rates will rise, and you'll have to pay back at higher interest rates what you would have gotten in a tax reduction, so I say continue working on market expansion.	Yes
28379	He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	No
19845	I'd better correct the president.	No
12995	He went to another country.	No
29653	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	No
20637	I would take the use of force very seriously.	No
13238	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	No
17918	We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.	No
1256	We have an extraordinarily high unemployment rate in urban ghettos in the city centre, especially among the very poor and especially among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 per cent.	Yes
27073	It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	No
30085	The question you asked is: What are we doing here in the United States?	No
24576	We don't have a person to waste in this country.	No
11867	Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	No
14369	I don't think we have a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a cabinet and appointments that look like America but meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
22483	Our schools are now better.	No
27062	And so everything we do, we do it in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel, which obviously has a great interest in seeing what is happening in Syria, in coordination with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this regard.	Yes
13540	And to come back to this question that we talked about at the beginning, that of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
1921	It's just -- it's -- we have -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the previous year.	Yes
17746	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of mind, morale, common sense in this country, and he has the right to deserve it.	No
13641	My plan balances the budget in six years.	Yes
7876	Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	Yes
20947	But dictator Milosevic was hanging.	No
13693	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	Yes
2734	I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.	No
16018	Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.	No
9499	And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	No
13018	Do I try to point out that we have no problems in Africa, Latin America or Asia?	No
29778	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	No
26934	I got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a result, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the Benghazi events marching and saying that America is our friend.	Yes
33725	Now she wants to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
7868	President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	No
18332	They withdrew after Sergio de Mello was killed.	Yes
8557	And I think we have a powerful country.	No
28132	Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	Yes
10390	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, it wasn't a document.	No
21959	But I think in terms of recession, of course you feel it when you are President of the United States.	No
19242	I thought it was a good program.	No
27155	But what is also important to us to understand is that for America to succeed in this region, there are things that we will have to do here too.	No
33628	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	No
8392	I think we're gonna have to.	No
29771	But we must always ensure that people are safe.	No
23200	Everyone received tax relief to get out of the recession.	No
33106	So I consider that a compliment.	No
19406	The tragedy is that our youth continue to increase their drug use to about 11 percent in total with marijuana, and I regret that.	Yes
1830	And the reason is that small businesses pay this individual rate; 54 percent of U.S. workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	Yes
9637	This is what I have done.	No
12590	I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	No
8797	In fact, today, the shortages of NCOs that John spoke of are such that if we tried to get a draft today, we wouldn't have NCOs to train NCOs.	Yes
7281	I think we need to check the background in weapons exhibits or anywhere to make sure that weapons don't come into the hands of people who shouldn't have them.	No
8388	The program - the Javits-Nixon program or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if it were fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	Yes
17504	I don't know the answer to when life begins.	No
1413	I could correct what Governor Carter said, speaking of arms control, yes, that's right, I think the sale of S-Saturday Night should be cut off, but he wants to record the handguns.	Yes
24785	I make no bones about it.	No
14898	that his own partner, George Bush, described as a voodoo economy, and said it would lead to an inflation rate of 30%.	Yes
13427	And the vice-president voted against federal support for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented it from being added.	Yes
9214	And we would have lost a million jobs.	Yes
32237	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	No
13124	"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	Yes
25944	And during this period, about 3,000 young children started smoking every day.	Yes
19706	We fired, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two per piece, and hit a radar, which repaired in a couple, three days.	Yes
34055	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	Yes
9058	But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	No
13627	So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	No
24302	And we've focused on the tactical.	No
25965	We proposed a regulation six months after I became president under the law he mentioned.	Yes
17173	And it's also unfair to drop those huge bills on our children.	No
11942	I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	No
28453	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	No
24298	You have all the rich countries in the Middle East trying to buy nuclear weapons.	Yes
27653	When he came home and wanted to be a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	No
1578	As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	Yes
10122	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	No
16542	But I am very pleased to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administration, we have had ten million people removed from tax lists at the lower end of the tax zone.	Yes
7132	It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.	No
28932	I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.	No
11985	I will do nothing to violate the rights of hunters or athletes.	No
29323	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	Yes
11335	Wages and incomes have gone down.	Yes
8077	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will moves in this way.	No
26322	The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.	No
14341	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	No
11857	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	Yes
28044	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	No
8084	It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	No
23032	I have an obligation to make sure that our government is doing everything it can to protect you.	No
18984	Because this is one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	No
15836	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	No
27176	This -- we have weakened our economy.	Yes
24237	But I think the important thing -- the important thing -- is to use the powers available to the President on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we will keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce debt at the same time.	No
1853	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	No
27198	They don't vote for war.	No
25307	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	No
11087	Unfortunately, nearly 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
19893	You, it's amazing for me, you're all having more responsibility at the local level for anything but schools.	No
15493	And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	No
32448	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
26924	Well, my first job as commander-in-chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	No
15438	There is a partnership in our country.	No
16568	I do not agree with that point of view.	No
16041	But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	No
21383	And I think that would discipline not only Congress, which needs it, but also the executive.	No
32570	They started from this small area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	Yes
21401	We're going to owe another $1 billion, just over $1 billion each working day of the year.	Yes
16780	These make-up, temporary jobs - as they are - are not the kind of jobs we want for our people.	No
23921	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	No
24284	Believe it or not, you can't ship it abroad, you have to do it here.	No
3167	I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	No
15329	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	No
26635	Reduce the capital gains rate.	No
6055	If you have health insurance, then you have nothing to do.	No
24565	In athletics, we know it.	No
29040	Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	Yes
13972	Let me point out that even today, in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, which was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a lifetime Conservative Republican, approved my candidacy because he knows that I will have a free and fair trade policy, a firm, realistic policy, and not let myself be caught up in everything the Bush administration has done.	Yes
23125	Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	No
21085	You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.	No
7096	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	Yes
11776	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	No
19212	That's what I want to focus on.	No
21496	Mr. Bush once again said that I was going to have $150 billion in tax increases.	Yes
18208	We will reform our intelligence services to ensure that we get the best information possible.	No
12303	That's not the way I would have done it.	No
26366	The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.	Yes
33305	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	No
16328	Yes, and I will apply it to Congress too.	No
4238	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I are mostly in agreement on these issues.	No
3048	We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	No
31	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	No
1580	We are still the fifteenth largest nation in the world in the area of infant mortality.	Yes
14839	I also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	No
12722	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his firm would be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	Yes
19277	This is the balance of a budget by 2002.	No
2427	At the moment, the CBO says that up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare enters into force next year.	Yes
16866	President Truman put his veto on average, while he was president, about 38 bills per year.	Yes
31840	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	No
22571	Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
8237	Does that mean his program is better than ours?	No
14496	You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	No
1126	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	No
17496	One final point: President Reagan, as the Governor of California, has signed a bill that is perhaps the most liberal bill in any state of the Union.	Yes
15023	We also are pursuing housing programs.	No
10821	That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	No
19764	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	No
11088	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	No
3074	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	Yes
6964	And if we do not act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	No
6980	Now, my compatriots, this is an invitation to disaster.	No
25181	"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I could add, Mr Trewhitt, that it was Seneca or Cicero, I don't know which one, who said, ""If it wasn't for the elders who corrected the mistakes of the young, there would be no state."""	No
2343	It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	No
375	Mr. Bush spoke of values.	No
19191	For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	Yes
23161	Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	No
23838	I think we've dramatically changed the world.	No
5976	We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, without problems.	No
33274	If you go with what Hillary says, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the mother's uterus just before the baby's birth.	Yes
20453	I'm against the removal of dams in the northwest.	No
12663	The purpose of all this is, it is a struggle in which we are engaged.	No
9447	Because I'm going to lower prices for everyone, but I'm going to limit deductions, exemptions and credits, especially for high-level people, because I'm not going to have people at high-wage levels less than they pay now.	No
7020	The jobs created by the President are $9,000 less than the jobs we lose.	Yes
22998	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't think we should be there first.	No
8869	Mr. May, I recently saw a study by Princeton University that indicated that the cities of America - the major cities in this country - are now in worse shape than they were in 1960.	Yes
11770	The governor mentioned it earlier.	No
186	But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	No
23054	Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?	No
11840	I think these crimes are different.	No
15425	We must have a society that's just and fair.	No
27175	Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	Yes
32922	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	No
27527	And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	Yes
4354	Senator Obama still does not understand -- or do not understand -- that if we fail in Iraq, he encourages Al-Qaida.	No
20094	So I rolled the dice, I put my career online because I really believe America's future is online.	No
6994	I won't privatize her.	No
884	The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	No
15857	Sam Raybum had a great expression about it.	No
20897	We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.	No
14306	We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	No
14252	And as you know, I insisted that the debate include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	Yes
7536	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we will also spread freedom and freedom.	No
6506	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	No
34387	No, it'll help you.	No
13762	I think we've been fighting since the first day to do something about downtown.	No
27922	When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	Yes
8337	Well, I suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that if you know the President, it was probably a fake remark.	No
13351	But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	No
28907	You cannot let public persuasion influence you, because the job is to enforce the law.	No
29832	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	Yes
1346	of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.	No
19491	So I'm glad I took this fight and I think, with all due respect, that I was right and that he was wrong.	No
18030	And if we lose our will, we lose.	No
1061	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	No
19124	I know that millions of you still have concerns.	No
12017	So we're distributing free of charge in our state of Texas.	Yes
13137	This is a serious issue, and I think we should fully understand whether we disagree and, if so, where.	No
19463	If it says to switch, you won't have a gun.	No
30010	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
32778	The Kurds were our best partners in Syria, as well as in Iraq.	Yes
18728	And China has a lot of influence over North Korea, some means more than we do.	Yes
1461	One of the overwhelming results I've seen in the polls is that people think you can't plan anymore.	No
11207	He will still not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the rise in power in Iraq, and it is the same kind of strategy to go out and keep and allow people to live a normal life.	No
324	I hope that from now on we will address the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, employment, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	No
27579	I see Syria with 30,000 dead civilians, Assad still in power.	Yes
26006	What we need to do is just make some adjustments to take into account the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are more numerous than those who went right before us and those who come right after us.	No
21314	There will be a job-sucking sound going south.	No
3027	He says he wouldn't do that.	No
19436	And I will not comment on other things that have happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	No
15464	As I said earlier, we fell below the national average of inflation when we did.	Yes
29240	Nine million people -- nine million people have lost their jobs.	Yes
13641	My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	Yes
3487	We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	No
19187	Saddam Hussein is probably better than he was four years ago.	No
23140	Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.	Yes
22554	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	Yes
13661	And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	Yes
19237	And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	No
33602	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	Yes
8544	As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	No
17390	I said that we would once again be respected in the world and that we would rebuild our national defence where we could deal on the world stage, and then seek disarmament, arms reduction and, hopefully, the elimination of nuclear weapons.	No
4046	But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	No
12691	Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.	No
3825	We took our eye off the ball.	No
10312	I want high wage, high skill jobs.	No
4019	This was last August, a year ago.	No
6391	The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
6923	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	No
1975	So I proposed a specific deficit reduction plan of $4 trillion.	Yes
2638	Mr President, Mr President, you have the right, as President, to your own plane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
2951	If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	No
12722	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	Yes
12179	But it's not a statement about his heart.	No
33105	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	No
19736	So it's not that we're still in disagreement.	No
25075	There's a big difference between the two of us.	No
12308	As long as people have comments.	No
30096	We are working with NATO, the longest military alliance in world history, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	Yes
22556	Now, the three things they're trying to say that I've changed my position are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	Yes
28242	I see one day in the United States of America where all our public schools are considered excellent, world-class.	No
1247	These programs have been designed to help those most in need.	No
23079	I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.	No
2853	We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.	No
27852	We're going to have to have a president, however, who doesn't think in one way or another the government is investing in -- in automobile companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, manufacturing electric batteries.	No
26418	We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	Yes
18585	Everyone knows it's hard, because there's a determined enemy trying to defeat us.	No
9422	Candy, it's not going to --	No
32804	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out she said the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	Yes
30184	I said, it's a terrible and stupid thing.	No
744	And yet, after meeting after the meeting, he endorsed this decision, approved the sale of arms to Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most erroneous foreign policy decisions we have ever made in this country, and I dare say I encourage others to take hostages as we know now.	Yes
20143	I want to say at the beginning that I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you have given me to be President for the past four years.	No
645	We must move forward with the process of negotiating strategic weapons, with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and with negotiations leading to the reduction of conventional forces in Europe, with greater reductions on the Soviet side, and with Senator Bentsen and I pursuing this policy.	No
22205	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said our schools showed more improvements than any other state in the country except another -- they named two states showing real progress in the 1980s.	Yes
6693	If you're married, we've reduced the marriage penalty.	Yes
28753	They should make their voices heard, but they should not have a megaphone that drowns the American people.	No
9047	And in doing so, at the same time, we built a new human race called an American - a proud, an independent, and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	No
20142	Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.	No
8786	And therefore, the families of some of our young soldiers are on food stamps today.	No
8031	I totally disagree with Senator Kennedy on this point.	No
22217	They could borrow the money and repay it as a percentage of their income or with a few years of service to our nation here at home.	No
19871	It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	Yes
15114	And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	Yes
9652	In my health care bill, I said that insurance companies must provide contraceptive coverage to all insured persons.	Yes
33458	People are coming from Syria.	No
10507	The key is to ensure that the next Secretary of the Treasury understands that this is not enough to help those at the top.	No
22936	You can't lead an alliance if you say, you know, you go alone.	No
10772	So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	No
98	And we want to bring him to justice.	No
27390	I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	No
14591	We are a rising nation.	Yes
1313	In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.	No
2100	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	No
6493	But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	No
21962	I'm glad you clarified it.	No
22458	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the best job that it will be great.	No
3908	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	No
21555	I make those charts you see on television.	No
2171	We will give a better prescription program.	No
3791	I have a long history and the American people know me very well and it is independent and a maverick from the Senate and I am happy to say that I have a partner who is a good maverick with me now.	No
28102	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	No
26483	Let me give you a little example.	No
15910	Who makes the decision, who makes the decision very difficult, very tearing?	No
28948	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment at national level.	Yes
10561	This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	No
12663	The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	No
22835	I don't think you can rely on UN sanctions, Randee.	No
15308	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	No
34173	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	No
23512	We need things that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	No
1855	And I think that would be a mistake.	No
16604	Quality control of health care is different.	No
16352	And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	No
34008	You should have changed the law.	No
25078	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you don't buy strength.	No
34362	It may be because of our experiences.	No
1691	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it will take a different path.	No
2161	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	Yes
7771	In February of this year, a Gallup Poll asked the people, in eight out of nine countries, who, he said, would be in advance by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries declared that the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	Yes
24083	These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.	No
18138	And you're going to see some of those kids in hospitals today who have been mutilated because they don't have weapons.	No
10950	And that's something I'm committed to doing as president.	No
21844	And my program is this.	No
20868	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	No
32930	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
12183	I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.	No
13131	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or there is military action in any region that indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	No
6754	And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.	No
23243	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	Yes
25066	And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.	Yes
15753	And we have serious problems with our conventional forces right now, and they will get worse if we don't have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.	No
33229	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	Yes
3997	"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	No
13820	For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	Yes
13157	But I hope that the next administration — and if I have something to do with it, the next administration — will make a final major effort to ensure the control of nuclear tests, the control of nuclear weapons, if possible, the control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to start over the subject of general disarmament.	No
15041	Since I was president, for example, I have appointed more than twice as many black federal judges as all the previous presidents of this country's history.	Yes
16175	But the only way to express your love for clean water is to double the credits for clean water, then fight against the deficit.	No
11242	You know, in April, I made a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in those disputed territories.	Yes
8720	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the current energy problem, because all you do then is to avoid, in the near future, the day when you reach the end of the energy supply.	No
25388	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	No
22038	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	No
17384	We have, to one-third of what it was.	Yes
4404	You know, my father came from Kenya.	No
17996	Moreover, we are pursuing a strategy of freedom all over the world, because I understand that free nations will reject terror.	No
28780	I don't care whether he's a Republican or a Democrat.	No
17095	We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	Yes
18848	I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	No
18745	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	No
6755	I think we have to respect that.	No
8900	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	Yes
7337	This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	Yes
12273	People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.	No
20652	So I want to rebuild military power.	No
8326	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him by law during the war.	Yes
11989	I am therefore in favour of closing the loophole in the issue of weapons.	No
780	You're being judged by the entire case.	No
10772	So let's not raise anyone's taxes, my friends, and you'll say it very clearly, I'm not in favour of tax reductions for the rich.	No
17042	I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	No
20303	The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.	Yes
10377	There is a fundamentally different vision of how we move our country forward.	No
29537	As soon as she releases them, I'll release them.	No
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
283	But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.	No
24062	He did not tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax reduction because it would be paid by increasing the tax on the rich and that he vetoed an investment tax credit paid by increasing the tax on the rich.	Yes
29053	I want the army to keep peace.	No
1952	So I'll get rid of that.	No
23597	You just know you're reading a good court decision.	No
5826	We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	No
18581	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	Yes
21333	I want to continue working after the ratification of this NAFTA agreement this year.	No
13809	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	Yes
11645	We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	Yes
11522	I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	No
27672	But we have work to do.	No
6865	Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	No
10563	The secretary already has the power to do so in the rescue plan, but it has not yet been exercised.	Yes
15020	Of the nine million people who have been working in new jobs since I was in office, 1.3 million have been among black Americans, and another million of those who speak Spanish.	Yes
21790	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I would go like their servant.	No
28112	The problem we have today is like the declaration of the patient's rights, especially with regard to health care, there are a lot of quarrels in Washington, D.C.	No
18823	And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	No
16385	Thank you, and God bless you.	No
20306	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	No
23441	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	No
17885	The president's preferred question is: Are you comfortable?	No
24735	The federal government has reduced Medicare and Medicaid in recent years, the states have reduced Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budgetary pressure.	Yes
22679	And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	No
32786	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	No
4125	And you know what happened?	No
3926	Now, General Petraeus praised the successes, but he said that these successes are fragile and that if we had set a specific date for the withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's initial plan, they would have been out last spring before the push had ever had a chance to succeed.	Yes
6349	And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	No
9515	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	Yes
18002	I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	No
7420	And as president, I am committed to changing that.	No
12022	The criminal won't show up and say hey, give me my ID.	No
12247	We have a very different vision.	No
740	But if there's one thing we understand too, it's that you can't make concessions to terrorists, never, never.	No
11990	In fact, I voted equally for the closure, but the majority in the House of Representatives went to the other side.	Yes
11111	What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	Yes
34071	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	No
15512	And I've never seen such a kick, an unfair kick, on a young senator my whole life.	No
700	We know where they cut.	No
16208	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	Yes
3967	I see how hard this land is.	No
27551	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	Yes
33484	I therefore believe that this is an unprecedented situation.	No
14466	Well, no one has yet addressed the real savings and loan problem -- no one has a business past, I guess.	No
31874	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	No
16790	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when five hundred thousand more people are out of work three months ago, when we have two and a half million more people than when he took office, it affects human beings.	Yes
18559	The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	No
11822	One of my concerns, however, is that I do not want to federalize the local police forces.	No
18835	My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	Yes
17689	Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.	No
22200	And I think you're right, that if we don't change education, we won't be able to compete.	No
14085	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	No
22377	Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	No
15407	All of this could be questioned by men.	No
2891	I have traveled among the people of this country for the past twenty-one months.	No
1938	The presidents would prefer to raise taxes.	No
5939	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	No
32623	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	Yes
18002	I think I'm gonna win, because the Americans know how to lead.	No
22641	He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.	Yes
19217	We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	No
4305	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among other things, because I worked through the driveway.	No
28543	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	No
22841	We were safer before President Bush came to office.	No
675	Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	No
21686	I don't think they're gonna give me a chance, but I'm gonna drop everything and go work on it.	No
6960	First of all, let me make sure that all the seniors who are listening today understand that when we talk about social security reform, they will always have their cheques.	No
2762	I'm gonna keep America strong and get America's middle class back to work.	No
22100	Since I became President, 43, 44 countries have become democratic, are no longer totalitarian, no longer live under dictatorship or communist rule.	Yes
28684	Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	No
32155	Premiums have gotten too high.	Yes
20973	They are often at the forefront of catastrophic situations.	No
8914	Well, we've seen what has happened.	No
24938	I was very interested in hearing about Central America and our process there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate, I would find Mr Mondale in full agreement with what we are doing, because the plan he outlined is the one we have been following for some time, including the diplomatic processes throughout Central America and in close cooperation with the Contadora Group.	Yes
16061	I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	No
21046	I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.	No
33028	But we need much more than wind and solar.	No
1021	With the tax program I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	No
15943	And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	No
11090	I've been in them all my life.	No
27747	They don't want the world to get into -- in various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to make goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of farms every year coming into cities, who need jobs.	Yes
8067	Now it means the best direction.	No
17871	We currently have 543 people.	Yes
7078	It also means that it removes pressure from the border.	No
6669	This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.	Yes
15172	You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	No
19818	I've been in touch with people my whole life.	No
18585	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	No
33934	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	Yes
9569	If the president were re-elected, we would go to nearly $20 trillion in national debt.	Yes
17238	Social security had to go bankrupt before 1983.	Yes
4325	Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	No
2026	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	No
33930	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	Yes
29482	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	Yes
17198	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	No
782	Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	No
21731	I have not been able to comment on this.	No
12891	This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	No
13317	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	No
19970	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to grant a targeted tax reduction - and let me talk about the education tax reduction - to allow people to have a $10,000 deduction for tuition costs at university any year, any type of tuition fees at university; to grant families a tax credit, a dollar for tax reductions for the cost of a typical community college so that we can open this up to everyone.	No
28912	Is the person guilty of the crime?	No
7461	And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	No
17454	In California, some time ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then democratic governor - signed a law that said that any man who abused a pregnant woman that he caused the death of his unborn child would be charged with murder.	Yes
20107	I said I would work for tax relief for middle-class Americans.	Yes
32268	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	No
21937	Are you suggesting that if someone has the means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	No
10763	There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	No
18588	He is the leader of that country.	No
11564	I hope that they will put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and the victory of the war.	No
29582	And if I had to do it again, I would, of course, do it differently.	No
27556	And I was reminded of what it would mean if it were my children.	No
19746	I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	No
28601	I want to change those provisions.	No
24167	There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	Yes
10445	We need to make sure it works.	No
21327	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	No
11705	And I mentioned one, and it's the Balkans.	No
16191	But I'm not gonna do that.	No
627	I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.	No
2633	And so that we can make sure that they have this opportunity and that they can walk through that door, it's vital, not just for these children.	No
596	And he just lifted martial law.	Yes
7848	Five cents a day - that's what the food package represents on average per person.	Yes
6695	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	Yes
141	So let's stay on the issue, and I made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	No
22483	Our schools are now better.	No
509	We have a large number of people, hundreds of thousands of people living with public assistance in this country.	Yes
27091	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came and said we're going to try to get a ceasefire.	No
17454	In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	Yes
32752	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur turns in their graves to the stupidity of what we do in the Middle East.	No
13110	That is something Senator Kennedy and all the Americans need to know.	No
27628	I can tell you at the same time that we will ensure that we look at what is happening in Pakistan and that we recognize that what is happening in Pakistan will have a major impact on success in Afghanistan.	No
11763	I just want to make sure the return is good.	No
1343	The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	Yes
23613	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	No
22489	That's why we had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, including many Republicans, support this campaign.	Yes
11497	One of the reasons why I think it is important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if we need to keep peace in order to be able to tell Saddam Husseinâ ¬¬ â â in the world or Iranians, do not dare to threaten our friends.	No
1358	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.	No
12711	Its influence is strong enough today to prevent us from getting the other Latin American countries to join us in economic quarantine.	No
33831	Because what I saw what they did was a criminal act, by the way, where they tell people to come out and start fist fighting and start violence.	Yes
20347	Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	No
28688	We can have filters on the Internet where public money is spent.	No
22804	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	No
26317	I'm going to keep my word to you.	No
1584	Employment ought to be restored to our people.	No
24448	There has been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	No
7834	But I don't expect it to come.	No
473	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that we all have to make.	No
461	And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	No
1882	The National Federation of Independent Enterprises has stated that this will cost 700,000 jobs.	Yes
2175	In fact, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	No
25189	And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	No
26128	So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	Yes
34202	No, you are the one that's unfit.	No
15277	So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	No
25148	"They went to him five days before they were killed and said, ""Please get them out of there."""	Yes
12986	And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	No
14614	I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	No
23926	Anyone in the White House should have the character of being there.	No
1770	I'll make sure we can keep burning clean coal.	No
2630	And therefore, what we have been able to do is to provide millions of additional help to students, reduce or maintain low interest rates on student loans.	Yes
26588	But these are important issues.	No
19594	Well, I forgot to mention North Korea and Cuba a while ago.	No
32109	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	Yes
14931	And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	Yes
21085	You bet we want to allow young workers to take some of their own money.	No
34214	Which is a big mistake.	No
30011	They never approved anyone on immigration.	Yes
8038	As far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, I think the question is not about these two small pieces of real estate - they are not important.	No
7592	And this position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with the Organization of American States as a whole - that prohibits us from intervening in the internal affairs of any other State and also prohibits them.	Yes
8085	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	No
3355	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	No
22165	That's what prompted me to take part in this race, so that we could rebuild the American economy.	No
30039	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	No
28250	Now, I said there was a contrast.	No
11759	It needs to be available for emergency situations.	No
7119	And we don't do what we should do in terms of technology.	No
19274	This economic package concerns families, but it is a six-point package.	No
17397	All these things have brought an improvement to the college entrance exams for the first time in about 20 years.	Yes
1261	These things would help cities a lot, but we still have one - a very serious problem there.	No
11495	It is better that there is no such thing or that there is a consequence if I am president.	No
29677	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	Yes
24070	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	No
26385	The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	Yes
11867	Let me tell you where the greatest discrimination is.	No
12051	Let me say something about Columbine.	No
8956	I believe that the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and that's a combination of planned tax increases that Carter has integrated into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	No
24345	And we're helping democracy, Ross.	No
25466	In other words, a President has to make choices.	No
23403	Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	No
9628	I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.	No
19286	It's a good package, Mr. President.	No
12515	And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?	No
1330	Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	No
14757	Together, we can do everything in our power.	No
33115	But she fights hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	No
34355	We will have what economists call intermediate growth.	No
14461	But what we need is financial reform; we need real financial reform, legislation on banking reform.	No
24266	We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	Yes
28558	For me, that's how you make society as safe as possible.	No
1522	So you can't compare unemployment, as you've been looking for it - with the current era with the 1950s, because the administration of the time had people in the army - they were at war, they were fighting abroad, and this administration reduced the size of the army by one million four hundred thousand.	Yes
13137	This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	No
23693	I made the right decision.	No
12099	It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	No
17005	I don't claim to know all the answers.	No
17769	And that's how it should be.	No
22821	A president's job is to win the peace.	No
22569	I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.	No
29701	So we have to do two things, as I said.	No
18198	We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	Yes
13299	I disapprove of the problem.	No
12222	The horse's up there.	No
715	At least that's what I read.	No
16858	In this interview, Governor Carter indicated that he would increase taxes on average or average or higher incomes.	Yes
14021	I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.	No
8388	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	Yes
15639	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	No
5511	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	No
29385	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	No
7466	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	No
22424	I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	No
13304	We can't settle for anything but the best.	No
97	I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	Yes
14601	Jim, you allowed Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the country's honour.	Yes
19871	It costs about $27,000 to pay the volunteers.	Yes
18025	The enemy understands that a free Iraq will be a major defeat in its hate ideology.	No
2517	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	No
17605	Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.	No
8578	Not at all Because these are determined men.	No
7706	They set a low level of materialism.	No
22644	He's trying to attack me.	No
923	In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	No
2595	We know that the path we're taking is not working.	No
22989	We are doing our best to share information.	No
15662	And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	No
23979	Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	No
429	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	Yes
12895	If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	No
2847	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.	Yes
29953	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	Yes
33256	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	No
30062	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	No
28972	It's time to have a fresh start.	No
21122	The safest federal investment gives 4%.	Yes
33503	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has passed her every step of the way.	No
22083	You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.	No
26239	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	No
1418	Well, Mr. Kraft, I strongly disagree with your assessment.	No
12551	In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	No
19877	You went to a private school for a while in your life.	No
20736	I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	No
11754	I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	No
12305	But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.	No
3296	But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.	No
4121	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	No
15742	Today, we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads on land, in the air and in the sea.	Yes
28946	We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	Yes
2246	It's... it's a big subject.	No
22466	And for a guy who started with everything he owned in the trunk of his car...	No
24757	As President, I must be sure that these derogations, which we approve everywhere, are covered by the law.	Yes
17722	But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	Yes
33114	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	No
15798	Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	No
23452	I'm not gonna do it, because it would be prostrating.	No
14852	That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	No
12600	Do you know that we don't have a single program sponsored by our government in Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	Yes
32497	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	No
24223	The plans are all over Washington.	No
18513	But I think it's worth it, Jim.	No
24634	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	No
16554	Approximately 14-15 thousand people benefited from this programme.	Yes
8604	Our program was an amendment to Bill Kerr.	No
8474	In my view, a strong Democratic Speaker supported by a democratic majority in the House and Senate can gain the support of these programs.	No
15272	the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	Yes
22891	And I mean, we move troops out of Korea and replace them with more effective weapons.	Yes
21041	It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	Yes
3498	But there is also the question of responsibility.	No
4065	We could impose significant and painful sanctions on Iranians who, I think, could have a beneficial effect.	No
18031	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	No
16667	However, as we look at quality of life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we believe that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the minimal necessary cost that will be required.	No
1212	Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	Yes
8295	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	No
34033	I think they'll see through it.	No
19138	And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.	No
13125	That's the problem.	No
2963	I do not believe that the Poles consider themselves to be dominated by the Soviet Union.	No
26410	That's what we will do.	No
18837	You can't run if you send mixed messages.	No
12198	That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	Yes
16438	First of all, it is a question of recognizing a huge economic force in this country and questioning the work of our people as a top priority.	No
20905	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	No
6927	This would be the largest ever increase in health care.	No
20599	But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	No
8623	I think we're ready to move.	No
25070	I'll tell you where we disagree.	No
4115	"What this means is that we do not do what we have done, that is, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we will not have direct contact with you."""	No
8367	The question is, in fact, which candidate and party can respond to the problems that the United States will face in the 1960s.	No
25945	So you add it up.	No
19434	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (p) you had a lady who said we should consider legalizing drugs.	Yes
26990	I am not going to wear pink glasses with regard to Russia, or Mr Putin.	No
12173	So he can throw away all kinds of numbers.	No
19821	I'm not some extremist out here.	No
23882	I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	No
27271	But, governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small business development ranked 48th, I think of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies you promote do not actually help small businesses.	Yes
16953	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	Yes
18370	She'll be strong as long as I'm the president.	No
12525	In the seven years leading up to the administration's entry into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people were behind the Iron Curtain.	Yes
13343	One of the additional powers I would suggest would be seizure.	No
23592	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	No
19046	We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.	No
2231	Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.	Yes
17575	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	No
21459	And everything in there says what I am for.	No
950	And then it gets down to a question of values.	No
24318	We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
32629	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	No
21886	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	No
32308	So he would have been alive today.	No
293	And I don't agree with them.	No
15759	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we are going to build all these systems, and at the same time invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	No
18655	It is the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	Yes
11150	Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	No
20787	As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	Yes
8018	I think we should defend Formosa.	No
20338	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	Yes
13452	I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	No
21616	Help me succeed in these programs.	No
27668	Then you have the army, then the civilian government.	No
27160	I believe, as the president said, and I said at the time that I supported his action there.	No
13605	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	No
3375	It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.	No
29300	Will they raise incomes in America?	No
25800	First of all, let me say what we did.	No
8384	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	No
19904	I feel strongly about education.	No
6396	And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	No
8688	I believe that we need incentives for the individual, for business and for industry, and I believe that the plan that I have presented, with detailed support, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	Yes
26125	Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	Yes
8150	A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.	No
23417	I think you ought to get the break.	No
12657	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	No
11543	I thought the President had made the right decision to join NATO and bomb Serbia.	No
28709	And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	No
8555	Well, I have to say that the reason why schools were built is because local school districts were willing to raise property taxes to an extremely high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of reducing returns to support these schools.	Yes
26403	We're going to have regulation -- we're going to have litigation reform.	No
21346	Our competitors don't do that.	No
24530	But I can tell you this.	No
16966	It does not seem to me that it is necessary or necessary to have legislation in this regard.	No
27613	You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	No
17321	And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	No
17153	"As far as social security is concerned, I hope there will be more time than this minute to mention it, but I will say this: a president should never say ""never""."	No
20847	Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	No
33457	People will pour into our country.	No
14126	You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	No
29401	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	No
15424	The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	No
15218	I do not think there is any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil will rise.	No
767	The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	No
3148	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	No
12884	And I believe that if we identify with this force, if we identify with it as Lincoln, like Wilson, like Franklin Roosevelt, if we become a friend of freedom, if we maintain freedom, if we help these people fight poverty, ignorance and disease, if we help them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa and Asia, finally in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	No
19191	For the first time in history, you pay about 40% of what you earn.	Yes
17719	Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.	No
23413	Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under the Bush presidency.	Yes
9191	And many of them, as you say, Candy, have long been unemployed.	No
6037	And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	No
13497	We must have control over inflation, and we must also have a favourable trade balance.	No
7283	And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	Yes
6995	I'm not gonna cut the profits.	No
20166	I learned to eat, walk and dress.	No
14474	And they buried it till right after the election.	Yes
23139	There is a bill on the floor of the United States Senate for which he could have stood and voted if he were so in favour.	No
27233	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	No
30369	You asked me a question.	No
11415	I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	No
20448	Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	No
17425	And so, my change had happened earlier than that.	No
1952	I'll get rid of it.	No
16271	That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	No
17198	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea of the leadership factor, since you asked for it.	No
24857	We need to do better in job retraining.	No
16792	"And I said, ""How many adults here are unemployed?"""	No
15754	And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	No
5790	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	No
19199	That's what America is all about.	No
2914	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
11520	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	No
19250	He hasn't fixed it for ten years.	Yes
14421	Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
15706	This is new and very different from what happened, but it is not quite ready to be fully implemented.	No
1979	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	No
29319	And I've done a lot...	No
11356	I know what it's like in dark times.	No
1428	As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	Yes
15355	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	No
2478	Your example of a Cleveland clinic is my case in detail, as well as several others I could describe.	No
16000	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	Yes
18805	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	No
14812	Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	No
14256	And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.	Yes
32266	Muslims must report problems when they see them.	No
2994	I wouldn't single out just food.	No
29354	But you don't have a plan.	No
33486	We have 17 intelligence agencies, both civilian and military, all of which have concluded that these spy attacks, these cyber attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and that they are intended to influence our election.	Yes
22914	They're families who are hurt.	No
17014	I think we can work together.	No
2831	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defence and a bad negotiating position.	No
21376	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend 220 dollars more.	Yes
25940	My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.	Yes
18009	This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	No
4037	And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	No
823	Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.Ã¢â€°Â¤	Yes
14220	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	No
3869	I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	No
1839	"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	No
33955	The earthquake and hurricanes, it devastated Haiti.	No
3143	I believe that the goodwill of both sides, the difficult negotiations on both sides and a reasonable compromise will be in the interest of all parties.	No
9377	And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	No
29555	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait and exchange here.	No
18789	And there, again, he kind of slipped through the question.	No
9569	If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	Yes
24813	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	No
2580	I believe in maintaining the strength of the American army.	No
31989	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	No
7437	I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.	No
27506	I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.	No
8806	This meant that 46% of your people who had registered had no reason to register.	Yes
15797	Members of the clergy who have done the same.	No
16480	Over the past ten years, the US budget has grown from about 11 per cent per year.	Yes
20057	They have all their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	No
26675	It is very difficult to enter the Japanese market, as everyone knows.	No
24338	And so, we've got a good military.	No
23602	Will we have equal pay for women, which is falling back?	No
9611	And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	Yes
25987	They didn't say what's going to happen, if they're going to have it declared addictive.	Yes
23507	I voted for the Patriot Act.	No
15058	This, for me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe that the American people will judge accordingly.	No
6405	It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	No
28750	The HMOs are against the patient rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and this government.	Yes
25297	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	No
20024	That's a problem they raised.	No
31909	No one has more respect for women than I do.	No
16087	I think I've addressed it.	No
25013	So, I can say there's a lot of interest.	No
9290	And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	No
27812	Nothing could be further from the truth.	No
3998	And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	Yes
11418	And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	No
2301	Well, I'd repeal it and replace it.	No
21694	I support the right to keep and carry arms.	No
7915	It - my view is the same as his.	No
34359	I want to invest in your family.	No
27887	The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	No
409	We now serve one million more families.	Yes
33178	This is the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution as it was supposed to be.	No
33757	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	No
17176	I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	No
16784	And Congress surpassing the bills I vetoed, Congress added some $13 billion to federal spending and the federal deficit.	Yes
26318	I'm going to keep my word to the American people.	No
2819	Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	Yes
24842	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	Yes
12655	It speaks of economic growth as a major indicator of freedom.	No
33757	That's why I'm going to have a prosecutor for the first time in history.	No
3459	It has to have accountability and oversight.	No
31888	I'm not proud of that.	No
3624	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can buy their own health care.	No
24836	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	No
8786	And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	No
23947	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country to attack people's patriotism, he was wrong.	No
24625	We must continue to do everything we can at the federal and local levels.	No
14847	In the Middle East, we have worked successfully for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, and we are linked with Israel and Egypt in a common defence capability.	Yes
11200	It is the same overall strategy.	No
19700	And what we did during the Bush administration, the Kurds were in the state department, negotiating, trying to settle their differences.	Yes
1677	It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	No
20347	According to my plan, half of their costs would be paid immediately.	No
18901	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	No
22638	The president wants me to change my mind.	No
2795	Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	No
25169	We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.	No
22270	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	No
16740	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	Yes
13309	Also as far as religion is concerned.	No
16563	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	Yes
32710	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	No
21697	I therefore support Bill Brady, which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state does what Virginia alone has done today, that is, automate its files.	Yes
6174	You were offered a chance to join.	No
24412	And right now, as you know, the United States has taken the lead in a no-flight operation up there in-- no-flight order in the United Nations.	Yes
259	I'm not questioning his passion.	No
11292	I want to make sure that the Iranians are sufficiently put - that we have put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining our allies, imposing significant and severe sanctions to change their behaviour.	No
27970	I want to see growing peace in this country.	No
24622	To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	No
23618	I can talk to people, like my wife Teresa, to make other choices, abstinence, and all the other things we should do as a responsible society.	No
3651	I voted against; Senator Obama voted in his favour.	Yes
2337	It wasn't thought through properly.	No
32725	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	Yes
743	As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	Yes
32721	Let me tell you something.	No
21383	And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	No
30331	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	No
15839	And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.	No
17761	Don't talk about growth, because even if we need growth, it doesn't help.	No
32182	In '17, it implodes by itself.	Yes
2173	They're smart enough to know it's not a good job.	No
20462	We must also have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States meet.	No
33600	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	No
21797	And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.	No
27812	Nothing could be further from the truth.	No
6396	And you have once again confirmed the basic decency and generosity of the American people.	No
17094	Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	No
13719	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	No
23452	I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.	No
32968	I want a Supreme Court to stick to Roe v. Wade and the woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court to stick to the equality of marriage.	No
33888	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but Donald said we couldn't trust to try the fraud and racket case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	Yes
13456	I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	No
31920	We're gonna get America back safe.	No
9904	And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.	No
9709	I went through the small business.	No
18196	My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	Yes
1097	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	No
27628	I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	No
287	I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.	No
15644	I don't think it's about whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	No
15756	That is why I repeat to all of you who have to deal with your domestic budgets and who know how difficult it is for the next president to do the same.	No
26287	We think this is very important because many people take care of their parents.	No
19305	In the case of the Product Liability Bill, which they passed and which I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I really wanted to sign this bill.	Yes
2227	That's the plan that I've put forward.	No
2480	These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	No
34435	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	No
20661	No one should doubt that, at least of all our potential opponents or opponents.	No
18663	We'd be in a stronger place today.	No
14473	Now, you and I never went around these yachts and the fancy stuff they bought, but you and I are paying for it.	Yes
25714	But this progress is only the beginning.	No
12123	And the budget plan I put in place, according to the Los Angeles Times, how these things are generally measured as a percentage of GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.	Yes
12114	And to make health care more affordable, allow associations of companies such as the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans through jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have the ability to have a national pool to lower the cost of insurance.	Yes
30203	I said, there's a person with a temperament that has a problem.	No
18264	There's a sense of American occupation.	No
3014	And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	Yes
13809	The index of poverty - unemployment and inflation added together - was invented by the Democrats - went through the roof.	Yes
11618	And so I don't think our troops should be used for what is called nation building.	No
12199	Upstairs -- let's talk about my tax plan.	No
13024	Because we are the first in the world in space, as I said; we are the first in science; we are the first in education, and we will go even further with the kind of leadership we can provide in those years to come.	Yes
28583	The federal government has declined, the Texas government has increased.	Yes
19330	You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	No
23558	Let me make sure you understand my decision.	No
17722	But when these huge deficits came into effect in 1981, what we call real interest rates -- the gap between inflation and the cost of a loan you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	Yes
27917	I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	No
18963	I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	No
14887	Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	No
2009	If you're re-elected, we'll have a debt of a thousand billion dollars.	Yes
20104	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	Yes
16956	It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	No
19153	Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.	Yes
24159	We need a very careful reflection during the transition phase.	No
19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	No
29263	So I have tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined to move the economy again, building on the progress we have made over the past eight years, but never going back to what has caused us trouble.	No
17447	But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	No
22281	We cannot have tomorrow's industries if we do not have the best trained workforce.	No
634	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	No
21550	I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	No
32276	But the name is there.	No
1995	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	No
13680	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	No
14312	-- and we do not need more of them in the Senate or in the House.	No
2002	But you've been -- but you've been president four years...	No
20030	Especially where it's someone you've had business with.	No
939	I want to keep this expansion going.	No
20293	But we will give you other choices as they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	No
17878	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	No
21410	Now, the facts are we have to fix it.	No
26988	Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	Yes
9916	I met with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term of office.	No
2191	The problem is that because the good would not necessarily match the inflation of health care, it was estimated that this would cost the average elderly about $6,000 per year.	Yes
792	And, so, I think I'd leave her there and you'd judge the whole case.	No
32427	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, for example.	No
13429	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we will have to grow more.	No
13609	Just the basic rules here.	No
13716	We have significantly increased investment and our jobs are growing.	Yes
5862	We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.	Yes
24273	We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	No
31963	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	No
159	And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	Yes
18293	And that's what I did with that vote.	No
24403	Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	No
24702	All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	No
18867	Maybe someone could call it a character trait, maybe someone wouldn't.	No
26398	She finally abandoned him.	No
19910	But this is a very liberal administration.	No
15029	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	No
13238	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	No
9759	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	Yes
19125	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	No
19551	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	Yes
1401	He did not have the help of the administration, of Congress, to carry this out.	Yes
21593	And so I'm very proud of how it happened and I think it's a very, very good start.	No
28984	Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	Yes
32930	But it's in part because those of us who had the great privilege of seeing this work closely and knowing how difficult it is, and it's not only because I saw my husband take a $300 billion deficit and make it a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and the incomes increased for everyone.	Yes
17226	The fact is that the President's budget was intended to reduce social security by 25%.	Yes
8140	He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	Yes
25593	That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	No
16833	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	No
15341	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.	No
29304	And because I have the same standards as I look at all these trade agreements.	No
6970	And they found a variety of ideas for people to look at.	No
2794	In each of these cases, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that Mr Ford and I will have an opportunity to discuss the reasons for these failures.	No
24072	We're trying to solve it.	No
3670	We'd all like to lower taxes on everyone.	No
23044	And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	Yes
7498	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	No
1215	And then, of course, the last thing - the last thing is that I signed and approved more picturesque rivers, more wild areas, since I was president than any other president in the history of the United States.	Yes
7940	Thus, the United States began to prepare for its major actions during the Second World War and the post-war period.	No
26384	We lost 357,000 jobs in manufacturing.	Yes
8280	You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	No
32031	In my opinion, the people who have been working at the FBI for a long time are furious.	No
6472	I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	No
24159	We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.	No
24759	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, which speaks of sound and reasonable civil rights legislation, was the most important piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we have something more than a technical problem.	No
23316	We've got all kinds of giveaways.	No
1759	And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.	No
11446	So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	No
14511	We've turned the country upside down.	No
3615	But, once again, I want to come back.	No
17761	Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	No
25432	But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	No
28879	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	No
25630	And with this thought, I realized what work I had with this letter.	No
2318	You had credit agencies that assimilated it as big A1 investments when they weren't.	Yes
11518	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	No
3874	And you know, after that, we spent a lot of time with them.	No
1974	Now we all know that more needs to be done.	No
8694	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is not the time to reduce the tax, given the emerging signs of new inflation, in addition to imposing restrictions on federal spending 15 months ago, I also suggested that we have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	Yes
709	And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	No
719	Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.	No
13764	I got it in every proposal I sent to Congress.	Yes
16123	The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	No
33413	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	No
7259	That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	No
19407	Let me tell you what I tried to do.	No
2086	... oil, tax relief, and then foreign companies.	No
6516	Bob, we relied on a company in England to supply about half of the influenza vaccines to the American citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they produced was contaminated.	Yes
2973	And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	No
15239	With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.	Yes
18914	That is the magnitude of what President Kennedy has envisaged doing with the nuclear-test-ban treaty.	No
12657	What we are doing in this country, the kind of society we are building, which will indicate whether freedom will be maintained anywhere in the world.	No
19192	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	Yes
14295	Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	Yes
3012	Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	No
8075	They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	No
10576	My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	No
26716	Why should they search your files?	No
29775	Now, I believe in community policing.	No
7619	We expressed our regret for a flight over East Germany under this administration.	Yes
18588	He's the head of this country.	No
11677	I would certainly be as wise in assessing any potential use of American troops abroad.	No
24465	I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	No
3435	Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.	No
8085	The Republican party produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey and Landon.	No
34146	So we're going to take Mosul now.	No
20877	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	No
8869	Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	Yes
7950	Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	No
29266	We've invested in a solar company, our country.	Yes
18010	And that's what they are.	No
21403	I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	No
16795	And still he talks about - uh success.	No
15305	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	Yes
12682	Let's see what that means.	No
26371	We have had a record number of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	Yes
2743	There is no doubt in my mind that if the president were re-elected, you would continue to see pressure from the middle class with declining incomes and rising prices.	No
9564	It's math that doesn't add up.	No
7264	We will be resolved, we will be strong, and we will wage a global war against terrorists.	No
1759	And I do it, both for companies and individuals.	No
31993	I'm absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	No
3828	But we have to use our military wisely.	No
2915	And I would also restore the involvement of Congress.	No
25965	We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	Yes
26964	But as far as our foreign policy is concerned, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s as well as the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	No
19850	So I don't want anyone to think we just voted no, no, no.	No
32149	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	No
20913	Let me give you another example.	No
9573	"So, for example, when he says, ""Yours is a 5 trillion dollar cup."""	No
25226	We have an ongoing arms race instead.	No
25351	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	Yes
17719	Mr President, if I have heard you correctly, you have said that these deficits have nothing to do with interest rates.	No
14576	He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
21563	I worked 12 years very hard as governor on real people's real problems.	No
21443	As you all know, I bought 30-minute segments to talk about problems.	No
8009	These islands are a few kilometres - five or six miles - from the coast of Red China, within a general port and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	No
13639	We've got to pay it back.	No
8485	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	No
11660	We need to work with Nigeria.	No
754	It's the best anti-terrorist report ever written.	No
24743	Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	Yes
25328	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in poverty and unemployment, they will seek this job beyond our borders.	Yes
14148	He got a notice or he didn't.	No
24698	Costs will continue to spiral.	No
6041	Free trade between us and Colombia, I have just told you the benefits of the conclusion of this agreement, a billion US dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening these markets.	Yes
33106	I therefore consider this to be a compliment.	No
17394	I think they also know that we have a commission that arrived a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	Yes
19933	The first thing you did when you came into office was put in place the stimulus package, says we have a bit of pork that we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	Yes
15537	And that's why people are so worried.	No
19398	And we must vote up or down, Mr President.	No
9880	The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.	No
574	I think we need new leadership now, and an understanding of these forces of change to provide the kind of force we need, and perhaps the Vice-President can explain what he was doing when he supported the arms trade to the terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that support from Mr. Macros.	Yes
12841	Here are the conditions I can establish.	No
21647	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	No
26365	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	Yes
22615	That's why we're bringing Al-Qaida to justice.	No
33361	He suffocated and went into a war on Twitter because the Mexican president said we're not paying for this wall.	Yes
19976	So the question is, do you want to buy a used election promise from my opponent.	No
17327	But do we want a constitutional amendment of the kind proposed by the President that leads local politicians to choose prayers that our children must either recite at school or be embarrassed and ask for apologies?	No
19881	And that's part of this liberal establishment, one of those liberal things you can't do.	No
30125	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	Yes
1691	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	No
26188	And so let me just say this.	No
23544	But I think we need to be very careful about the balance between ethics and science.	No
13433	Over the past eight years, average growth has been about two percent.	Yes
22314	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.	Yes
197	But I don't want to mandate him and risk rehabilitating this.	No
17088	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	Yes
8011	We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	No
4173	We do that all the time.	No
29006	You know, it's not a bank account that just earns money that's invested.	No
4197	It is important that we recognize that there will be areas of common interest.	No
30184	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	No
12549	They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	No
7069	After all, I was a border governor for a while.	No
27884	...you've had the floor for a while.	No
33823	As if you were watching what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	No
25406	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	No
24427	This is essentially a problem of primary concern to the European Community.	No
34232	Look at him.	No
19567	So I'm going to have a review from top to bottom at the Pentagon, not a review from bottom to top.	No
17699	I think the business community wants to get involved.	No
11063	If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	No
16306	Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	No
11760	I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	No
6526	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	No
7419	We have to change that.	No
8026	I think we should do it in Berlin.	No
24168	That's what I want to do.	No
16544	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	Yes
22839	Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	Yes
7952	In my opinion, they're gonna be bigger.	No
10037	You know that I mean what I say.	No
18197	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	Yes
24957	And what about the mining of Nicaraguan ports that violated international law?	No
32266	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	No
32705	At the moment, Syria is fighting ISIS.	Yes
19397	We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	No
21205	I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.	No
27874	...because the private sector is not going to invest in a...	No
33016	We must save as many lives as possible.	No
25823	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	No
22675	And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	Yes
15152	Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	Yes
28452	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong in maintaining peace.	No
25447	If one day someone comes with an answer, it's something else.	No
26757	We still have some of this hatred inside us.	No
23721	"The truth is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""and the world would be much better."""	No
12760	Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	No
20202	I have questioned his proposals.	No
10945	It would also remove the ability of states to provide some of the insurance company regulations to ensure that you are not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	No
22851	I will lead the world in the greatest counter-proliferation effort.	No
471	It's as simple as that.	No
16606	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	No
13422	The Vice President suggested a number of things.	No
2584	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	No
1397	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	No
20428	Today, we import a million barrels of Saddam Hussein.	Yes
14843	Seven over eight years, defence budget commitments decreased, or 37% in total.	Yes
14894	It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
25576	And if you want a hard president who uses that force to get weapons control and draw the line in the sky, vote for Walter Mondale.	No
9924	No, let me go back and talk about the points the president raised and -- and -- and correct them.	No
33954	But with regard to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	Yes
17964	And we admire your arrogance and perseverance.	No
19372	What about the drugs that have increased, doubled over the past 44 months?	Yes
20448	Secondly, the difference is that we need to explore at home.	No
1711	First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	Yes
16864	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loosely with the facts about the vetoes.	No
22088	At the turn of the century, we have to control our deficit, we have to get out of it for the surplus to accumulate, so when baby boomers like me retire, we're fine.	No
23403	Jane, there are many ways to be competitive.	No
10838	I've been fighting overexpenditure.	Yes
27411	And that's not reflected in the kind of budget you're proposing because it doesn't work.	No
8142	I don't want an American's talents wasted.	No
298	They raised the same thing with me about the allegiance commitment.	No
29751	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	No
12121	I want a smaller and smarter government.	No
10046	There have been many days that have passed before we knew whether it was a spontaneous demonstration, or indeed whether it was a terrorist attack.	No
30041	And maybe it's barely feasible.	No
2964	Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	Yes
2592	The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	Yes
16659	We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	No
1172	I'd say several hundred of them.	No
24408	America is at the forefront of humanitarian aid to Somalia.	Yes
17551	Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	Yes
8358	I would say that people now have the opportunity to assess his position against mine and I think he and I will stick to what people decide.	No
19211	How can we help people like us to get their retirement when they work for small businesses, to be able to pay for health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	No
17759	Yes, we have a deficit of $263 billion.	Yes
11931	And in that case, we can't increase the penalty more than putting these three thugs to death.	No
20723	Why didn't they do it in seven years?	No
3673	With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	Yes
6051	Two women, both probably from mid to late 50s, had just been laid off.	No
11513	This current administration has worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	No
18511	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	No
2662	It's because I care about education for all of our kids.	No
12969	It opposed all the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage, housing, economic growth and the development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the others.	Yes
15448	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	No
17652	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	Yes
8923	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	No
14339	-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	Yes
7096	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden increase and the tax burden of the richest has fallen.	Yes
33325	We're -- right now, we have the drugs, they have the money.	No
6809	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved in these programs.	No
16741	These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	No
19671	Well, many of the provisions of the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, such as the long-term care deductions, make sure that self-employed people watching tonight can deduct not 30%, but 80% of your contributions.	Yes
25468	The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	No
7755	They have also cut $4 billion in mutual security over the past six years.	Yes
19115	It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	No
22650	Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	No
22448	Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.	No
13146	With regard to the issue of disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament, I must say that I believe that another effort should be made by a new administration in January 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and to see if it is possible to reach a conclusion that will reduce the chances of contamination of the atmosphere and also reduce the chances that other Powers will begin to possess nuclear capacity.	No
28227	We do it in my state of Texas.	No
8122	I should say very clearly that I don't think we're doing enough, that I'm not satisfied as an American with the progress we're making.	No
14951	In fact, one of HEW's secretaries under Mr. Carter's direction testified that he believed there was $7 billion in fraud and waste in the well-being and medical programs associated with it.	Yes
230	But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	No
27454	You see him right now in the economy.	Yes
19548	Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much weaker than it was.	Yes
12768	I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	No
11407	He's a solid judgmental man and he's going to be a person by my side.	No
24453	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he appreciates American families, that they are people with social assistance that you are trying to move from social assistance to work, the poor workers who, in my view, deserve tax relief to raise them above poverty if they have a child at home and work 40 hours a week, the working families who deserve a fair tax system and the possibility of constant recycling; they deserve a strong economy.	No
14107	I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.	No
13993	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	No
32494	And that's, like, no growth.	No
27557	Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	Yes
29711	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	No
30421	I was going to say something...	No
13014	Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	Yes
3365	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, the CIA, we were wounded.	No
27335	There are a number of things that seem good, but frankly, we can't pay them.	No
32903	It was just taking a look at the person she built to be that wonderful Scout girl who wasn't a Scout girl.	No
16827	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	No
12139	It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	No
29356	Secretary, you have no plan.	No
8887	If Pittsburgh doesn't have the money to fix water leaks, it's because the federal government preempted.	No
11355	My mother basically raised our family.	No
3357	Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	Yes
12519	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - presented by the international communist movement.	No
22793	General Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the Army, told him that he was going to need several hundred thousand.	Yes
12799	I hope we can succeed.	No
26012	I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	No
20388	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	No
33282	And I don't think the government should do it.	No
2998	Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.	Yes
4132	And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	No
18912	And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	No
16702	I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy with the exception of us.	Yes
27076	And finally, we don't want any military involvement there.	Yes
7889	I'm not sticking to it because it's not something to do, it's something to build.	No
2428	And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.	Yes
14983	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	No
14388	So it is only another of these little things that they invent to try, instead of facing problems, to redefine a person who runs against them.	No
15882	I think the American people would appreciate that.	No
26643	People are so tired of politics.	No
32076	She didn't even know what that word was -- what that letter meant.	No
26932	But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	No
7077	You see, the map, it will have a period of time attached to it.	No
3894	Jim, there's a lot of things we need to answer.	No
27198	They don't vote for war.	No
12477	I want to do something about social security.	No
8745	We're gonna have to use the van billiards, the car billiards.	No
18987	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	No
3874	And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	No
3654	You've got to look at our records.	No
6661	Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.	No
14401	So I'm saying it's very simple.	No
15893	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	No
19138	And that brings me to conclusions different from those of Senator Dole.	No
32496	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	Yes
18642	To answer your question, I hope we never have to.	No
23007	And I accept what the president has said.	No
30256	I say, who does this -- we lose everything.	No
15194	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	No
29119	I mean, we're on stage tonight together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	No
1032	I remember 1973 in the depth of the energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to reduce the waste of fuel, to reduce the speed of cars.	No
24606	So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	No
15894	We took the child to New York.	No
31981	But it was something that happened.	No
7030	That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	Yes
2631	And this is an example where our priorities make a difference.	No
32350	He's been dismantled, but it never prevents him from saying what he means.	Yes
29344	So it's President Obama's fault?	No
14476	If that's true, tell me now.	No
21757	I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.	No
11997	I think we should make all schools free of weapons.	No
19715	In the end, we went there alone.	Yes
16343	And it's a shame, and I'll do my best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate on morality.	No
25205	Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	No
28972	It's time to start anew.	No
16144	He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.	No
17130	Our friends from the countryside and the farm have continued to devastate.	No
19150	The president trusts the government.	No
3156	Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	Yes
4061	Let's be clear.	No
7157	It's to make sure we raise standards.	No
5888	If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	No
7701	We sit on a remarkable scene.	No
21167	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	No
26227	We doubled the number of small business administration loans, tripled the number of loans to women entrepreneurs, no one without qualifications, everyone had to meet the standards.	Yes
32497	And I'm taking them back to one of the lowest in the world.	No
24714	So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	No
2740	But they lead in very different directions.	No
19667	And they said no because they received a note from one of their political advisors saying that they should rather characterize everything we did as a great government and ensure that nothing was done to help health care before the 1994 election so that they could make that claim.	No
26234	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	No
13799	He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.	Yes
13645	The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	No
13493	If his file is the opposite, it means he doesn't want to go.	No
32913	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	No
8308	We have had a higher tax burden from the Treasury for the farmer in recent years with the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
15223	We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.	Yes
20345	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	No
12141	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	Yes
6774	What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.	No
9295	How did the president say no to this pipeline?	No
32234	We're gonna be able to do it.	No
6510	No, this war is a matter of using all the goods at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	No
25586	But I think that strength must also require wisdom and intelligence in its exercise.	No
22018	But that's what the election's about.	No
29487	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	No
24946	And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	Yes
92	Seven administrations were in charge of Mr. Noriega.	Yes
17036	The individual worker in factories across the United States should not be a small wheel in a large machine.	No
1008	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.	No
7458	"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."	No
13170	Yes, we should make a great effort.	No
34185	Chris, we don't gain anything.	No
21876	A senator runs every 6 years.	No
21808	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	Yes
525	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	Yes
16460	I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	No
2926	After the United States took the initiative to work with Israel and Egypt and to reach the Sinai II agreement - and I am proud to say that no Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	Yes
14586	He'll do -- and he'll do for the United States what he did to Arkansas.	No
24749	I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	Yes
5551	Now, Senator McCain, the centrepiece of his economic proposal is to provide additional $200 billion in tax relief to some of the richest companies in America.	Yes
123	But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.	No
15934	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	No
1894	We created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
13494	Now on the question of gold.	No
8725	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been removed from government circulation for whatever reason, that the most competent oil geologists believe probably contain more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled this first well 121 years ago.	Yes
17327	But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	No
33048	And all you have to do is go to a big place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they do to people, miners and others in the energy sector.	No
10112	#NAME?	No
32015	So you really owe him an apology.	No
15657	What was he talking about?	No
13392	Mr Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	No
29962	And, you know, I also notice the very bad ads you do about me in so many different ways, which I don't do about you.	No
6060	We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	No
12711	His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	No
28054	In fact, I brought the Republicans and Democrats together to do exactly that in the state of Texas to get a patient's statement of rights.	Yes
14383	They've been investigating every one of my children.	Yes
6782	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	No
20071	I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	No
4353	We look like we're back in a circle.	No
2564	Yes, because I think that's the kind of investment the federal government can help.	No
32841	You know, at law school, I went to work for the Children's Fund.	No
30109	They're choking on the sanctions.	No
15852	But he's in the arena.	No
18264	There's a feeling of American occupation.	No
21899	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	No
7422	I think we have to come together and work to change it.	No
9050	We are facing the terrible problems that we talked about here tonight.	No
9761	We saved a car industry that was on the brink of collapse.	Yes
8493	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	No
3270	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	Yes
30367	You have -- wait a minute.	No
13886	You cannot do it as president: you cannot have a schema on one side of the question one day and the other on the other.	No
18896	And at the time, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle East country with nuclear material.	Yes
24143	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	No
24068	It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	Yes
8209	What's the net result of this?	No
15791	I am thinking of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk, who, for example, discovered a vaccine that cured one of the most terrible diseases we have ever had.	No
2109	What we have right now is a framework where I would like to bring money from abroad back to this country.	No
27797	But I made a different bet on American workers.	No
20592	And I hope he'll be away soon.	No
3944	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	Yes
15875	Maybe we think you're treating them in different ways.	No
15875	We may think that you deal with them in different ways.	No
11518	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	No
21423	And everyone says they take their responsibilities.	No
9736	You know, there are things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	No
21556	But you don't have to wonder if I'm talking.	No
12897	If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	No
12636	I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	No
24520	#NAME?	No
6739	The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.	No
2347	Banks are therefore reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	Yes
14691	Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who supported me because he clung to the NRA and didn't want to fight for the Brady Bill.	Yes
18395	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	No
16723	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	No
1570	My own background is different from his.	No
23544	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	No
28145	The doctor chooses the prescription you need and no one can overstep your doctor.	No
3154	Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	Yes
14429	And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	Yes
5557	In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	Yes
3329	Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
2812	I could say that in closing, that is to say, as far as foreign policy is concerned, Mr Kissinger was President of that country.	No
14952	We've had the Central Accounting.	Yes
17772	Now I have to start with a smile, from his kind words to me.	No
6321	And it was because they wanted to choose school that they thought they were the best for their children.	No
6940	Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	No
34165	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
29408	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	No
29702	We have to restore trust.	No
15839	And we said, hey, we have to free the Bush kids.	No
26576	We can invite all candidates.	No
14868	I would also like to point out that the Republican Presidents of those years, faced with a democratic majority in both chambers of Congress, have found that their requests for defence budgets are very often reduced.	Yes
11985	I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	No
18680	I would have made a better choice.	No
7678	These are the issues that the North and South, East and West have the right to know.	No
19328	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	No
10816	Social Security is not that tough.	No
26258	That is not how America has become the largest country on the face of the earth.	No
19517	When I took up my duties, the worst war in Europe was the war in Bosnia.	Yes
8695	I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	No
21876	A senator runs every six years.	No
1224	We have no energy policy.	Yes
1684	This is obviously a very tender topic.	No
15668	But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	No
11953	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	No
1205	I put my veto on the mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the huge consensus of well-informed people that this mining bill would have meant the loss of thousands of jobs, something of about one hundred and forty thousand Jabs.	Yes
10447	This means that we're cracking down on CEOs and making sure they don't get bonuses or gilded parachutes as a result of this package.	No
6516	Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.	Yes
20010	Our plan is better, it will lead us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	No
6795	All these things come out of this basic teaching and belief of faith.	No
20478	It's the right thing for the consumers.	No
26661	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	No
8843	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	No
2680	We cut taxes 19 times.	Yes
15983	I am optimistic and I believe that we can maintain this longest expansion.	No
1507	And my success in the primary season was, I think, remarkable for a newcomer, someone from outside Washington, who - who was never part of the Washington settlement.	No
32974	So I have very clear views on what I want to see a change in the balance in the Supreme Court.	No
8827	The initial cost is about $54 billion, then when you add additional costs - not only system construction, missiles and personnel, etc. - when you add additional costs over the life cycle of this system, more than $100 billion.	Yes
32147	If he wants to start, he can start.	No
34247	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	Yes
7018	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	No
559	And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	No
21646	There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.	No
8160	The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	No
14717	I want a country where people who work hard and play according to the rules are rewarded, not punished.	No
23780	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	No
25261	Very early in my administration, I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by a previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- than a 10-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
21561	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	Yes
3168	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	No
2943	I believe that we have negotiated with the Soviet Union since I was president of a position of strength.	Yes
29474	And when you look at what you are proposing...	No
30387	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	Yes
2593	The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.	Yes
21983	That's because we're in the grip of a failing economic theory.	No
16885	For example, this Congress, very soon, will spend $1 billion a year on its household, salaries, expenses, etc.	No
33716	Our product spills from China, spills from Vietnam, spills from all over the world.	Yes
6055	If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	No
23546	Destroying life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas we're facing.	No
25091	We must refuse, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction before the World Court because they will find us guilty of illegal actions.	No
3700	We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	No
20571	He's on the ballot in this election, don't make a mistake about it.	No
19616	I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	Yes
191	There's nothing like something free there.	No
9708	Our party was too long.	No
14468	The President of the United States was officially told that this was a $20 billion problem.	Yes
27784	We have to tell our friend in China, you play aggressively.	No
28333	Flexibility is required for teacher training and the hiring of teachers with federal money.	No
27916	That is why we must move forward and not go back.	No
963	They ensured that their sons understood that it was the largest country in the world, that those of us who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened its arms to our parents and gave them so much.	No
11209	I therefore trust that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same work he did in Iraq, will do it again.	No
28057	We have one of the patient's most advanced rights.	Yes
32340	How do you do that?	No
21596	We hear all the negatives.	No
26323	It's not gonna make a hole in the deficit.	No
27960	But after a decade of war, I think we all recognize that we need to build a nation here, rebuild our roads, bridges and, above all, take care of our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our freedom.	No
10266	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	No
7606	Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	No
20428	Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	Yes
15968	The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	No
21939	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	No
645	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	No
15450	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	No
12856	I think if we had stayed in that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	No
1325	I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	No
10221	It used to be the United States of America.	No
344	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	No
25684	I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	No
8854	But Detroit is taxed for money that, let's say, goes to Chicago, while Chicago is taxed to help with problems in Philadelphia.	Yes
16573	As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	No
2820	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defence budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
12852	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	No
10130	They're using cheap hand guns.	Yes
11746	And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	No
1932	And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.	Yes
1892	The approach referred to by Governor Romney is the same as that taken in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficit, and all this culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
33830	And I think it's her campaign.	No
24363	Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.	No
10832	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	Yes
18334	My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	Yes
22195	The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	No
20084	And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	No
23081	Now he's talking about health insurance.	No
169	What he proposes after more than a trillion new debts that have been added to the federal debt over the past eight years, an OI our children and grandchildren will pay for years, is a tax reduction for the richest one per cent of the population in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we are going to give to people who earn $200,000 a year.	Yes
29771	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	No
7187	Again, the president did not answer the question.	No
23986	What I do not accept is to demonstrate and organize demonstrations in a foreign country when your country is at war.	No
29516	You know what that is?	No
21694	I support the right to keep and bear arms.	No
30342	And it's a big problem.	No
25326	And that's why the sanctions provisions we had, and so on -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration, join us again when Congress returns to get an immigration bill that will once again give us control of our borders.	No
26562	So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	No
31990	Her client she was representing sent her down, and she saw her laugh twice, mocking the girl who was raped.	Yes
28883	You'll live in a world, I hope, that's more educated, so it's less likely that you'll get hurt in your neighborhood.	No
14771	For the American people, I do this because I love you.	No
2496	It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	Yes
23113	You went up to Missouri, about $3,500.	Yes
16595	When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	No
11337	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	No
18867	Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	No
27373	If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	No
11618	And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	No
19025	I believe we can be successful.	No
10906	You know who voted against it?	No
26909	But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.	No
16289	That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	No
18068	My opponent looked at the same information I examined and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a serious threat.	Yes
8221	And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	No
13172	There must be an absolute guarantee.	No
6122	So if you have $5,000 and it's gonna cost you $12,000, it's a loss to you.	No
34042	It's twisted -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	Yes
13327	I do not think we should have compulsory arbitration or seizure.	No
4118	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	No
28453	Saddam Hussein is still a threat in the Middle East.	No
6844	We want electronic medical records to reduce errors and reduce costs.	No
3638	One last point that I would like to make, since Senator McCain has spoken about granting a $5,000 health credit.	No
27228	Make sure we bring the manufacturing industry back to our coasts so that we can create jobs here, as we did with the automotive industry, without rewarding companies that ship jobs abroad.	Yes
11658	Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	No
2623	The place where they work together to design training programs.	No
34205	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you had a bad judgment.	No
17015	And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	No
32829	But by doing all the favors of others, she does me favors.	No
15373	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	No
28462	Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	Yes
8785	And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	Yes
10463	The Americans are angry, they're angry, and they're a little scared.	No
1245	I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.	No
7940	That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	No
16737	Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.	No
12682	Now let's just see what this means.	No
23992	The taxation of people over $200,000 will not provide you with $150 billion.	Yes
11896	The Byrd family may also have a misunderstanding in Texas.	No
22060	This is a priority in this country.	No
26617	And we need to make it stronger.	No
652	Because Soviet change is not yet fully established.	No
21211	And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.	No
15434	Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	No
28173	Under Governor Bush, Texas sank to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for its citizens.	Yes
16446	In this case, a CCC-type program would be appropriate to channel money to the private sector, as well as to local and state governments, to hire young people who are now unemployed.	No
16442	First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.	No
19422	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	No
2862	I do not believe that it is in the interests of the United States and NATO nations to have a communist government within NATO.	No
16476	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	Yes
17777	"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is that true?"	No
8807	So I think it's a pay scale case, to recognize that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our safety, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sake, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice we're asking for.	No
26038	"I knew it wouldn't work."""	No
7679	What leadership will the President provide in these areas to ensure equal employment opportunities?	No
20940	Start asking the question, what do you know?	No
19915	I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	No
15420	As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	No
24080	We have spent $4 trillion worth.	Yes
1208	The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	Yes
7278	In fact, I made my intentions -- I made my point clear.	No
7613	In my view, this statement has been distorted by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates across the country and in their discussions.	No
19623	We must be firm and strong.	No
9734	And it is the kind of difficult business actions that are needed.	No
1056	Uh, I agreed to give the interview to Playboy Other people have done so that are Governor Jerry Brown, Walter Cronkite, Albert Schweitzer, Mr.Ford's Secretary of Treasure, Mr.Simon, William Buckley, many others.	Yes
9523	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	No
5743	I've got the scars to prove it.	No
8545	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	No
10983	I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	No
23861	I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	No
12659	We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
6704	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	Yes
12315	China and India were exempted from this treaty.	Yes
13253	I think the president was right to order these flights.	No
953	And we have a wide range of differences on these.	No
2875	And his own management and budget office testified that he had $3 billion reduction insurance added to the defence budget - the defence budget under pressure from the Pentagon.	Yes
7794	It goes to our survival.	No
24457	So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them.	No
3710	We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.	Yes
6777	And that's why I support it.	No
12174	I'm just telling you, our state is meeting to do what's right.	No
12220	And they have not got it done.	Yes
26850	Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.	No
5664	But I was fighting for a veto on a line, and I would certainly oppose any pork barrel bill.	No
19529	They didn't have the guns, they didn't have the tanks.	Yes
24210	I live in a state where employment growth in the manufacturing sector has far exceeded the nation in recent years, where we have created more jobs in the private sector since Mr Bush was president than in the rest of the country, where Mr Bush's Secretary of Labour said that employment growth has been huge.	Yes
19374	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	No
3036	It's for their safety as well as ours.	No
499	People who try to help these children, programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush does so that people can learn to read in this country and continue to break this cycle of poverty.	No
6636	Health care costs for the average American increased by 64 per cent; tuition increased by 35 per cent; gasoline prices increased by 30 per cent; health insurance premiums increased by 17 per cent a few days ago; prescription drugs increased by 12 per cent a year.	Yes
16501	In fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and more than 50 percent of the uh tax credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
9421	It's crucial for our future.	No
84	And we have to start early, first, second and third year, before our young people start experimenting with these very, very dangerous substances.	No
2280	I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	No
16405	I wish I could tell my grandchildren, four years after my first term, that your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	No
22496	We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	No
26430	For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	Yes
12209	I can't point out how much.	No
25086	In fact, I believe that each of these standards is essential to the country's exercise of power.	No
4065	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	No
15404	Well, my last word is again to say this: we were talking about this very simple amendment and about women's rights.	No
32235	You're going to have plans...	No
9648	Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.	No
1665	And housing has begun to rise.	Yes
22337	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	No
6774	What is an article of faith for me is not something I can legislate on someone who does not share this article of faith.	No
31989	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman at the age of 12, was raped at the age of 12.	No
25016	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	No
32306	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	Yes
25417	Now, why do I support the freeze?	No
12305	But I would certainly have consulted the governors and the elected representatives before acting unilaterally.	No
24384	They didn't cuddle.	No
29146	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	No
24110	And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	No
2439	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said that what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	No
22594	I do not see how you can run this country in times of war, in times of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	No
1544	The Americans are cured, working together.	No
15520	We're going to enter a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	No
11722	I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	No
17355	They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	Yes
11011	That's how in banking it works.	No
19540	I think there are still a lot of problems in Bosnia.	No
17687	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line four years ago.	Yes
6577	Now, I'm going to reverse that.	No
29814	When a person is on a watch list or a non-theft list, and I have NRA approval, of which I am very proud.	No
11245	We haven't done enough.	No
3872	I was honored to be there.	No
18877	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	No
2877	Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	No
16839	You cannot hire a lobbyist from the indemnification cheques.	No
20222	Well, we come from different places.	No
19115	It's a great honour for me to be here as a Republican candidate.	No
17427	I found that was rather difficult to do.	No
20517	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	No
13880	I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	No
16379	Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	No
6597	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or financially healthy, but he voted more -- he voted 277 times to give up the budget limits, which would have cost taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	Yes
21341	So what is the answer?	No
8688	I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	Yes
18096	As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	Yes
97	I went there and talked to the President of Panama to clean up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we charged him.	Yes
8307	The fall in the price of support to limit production is not working, and we now have the highest - surpluses - nine billion dollars.	Yes
17614	And what did you do right after the election?	No
13452	I think we should look at this and other deductions, tax burdens, dividends and everything else, and how we can stimulate growth, how we can provide the income we need to move our country forward.	No
14675	So I'm still focused on interference, I guess.	No
2442	Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.	No
13184	As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	Yes
31	And it's not a Republican, Democratic or Liberal problem.	No
10908	I have fought from time to time against this pig barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everyone and they buy the votes.	No
12040	I think that States should do this for new handguns, because too many criminals receive weapons.	No
16009	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	No
17232	So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	No
2638	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
23111	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	Yes
34004	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a senator from the United States...	No
2984	This is not the way to manage our foreign policy, including international trade.	No
730	That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	Yes
2371	Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	Yes
19421	Again, it's, you're very selective, Mr. President.	No
20775	Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	Yes
12969	It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.	Yes
19044	The military will be an all-volunteer army.	No
11798	We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.	No
6277	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	No
25119	Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	No
20893	Republicans and Democrats have come together and said what can we make our public education the best in the country?	No
23970	In addition to that, the money I get from high-income people and to ask foreign companies just to pay the same income on their earned income in America as U.S. companies will be used to give incentives to high-income people.	No
15904	And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	No
32294	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	No
19647	I know that you will probably oppose it, Mr President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a more flattering one, and we will have a fairer and flattering one and we will make the economic package work.	No
7253	The people I talked to their spirits were high.	No
33618	Saudi Arabia, just money.	No
14010	Or do you just keep interfering at will?	No
28447	It must be on the calendar of the people we're trying to bring to the peace table.	No
19948	Their budget reduced the enforcement of the law for the Environmental Protection Agency by one third.	Yes
11643	I would like to come back to the issue of nation-building, but let me first address this issue directly.	No
29214	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have done so for years, not now, because we created a movement.	No
7267	In fact, I said the opposite: I will never return the security of the United States to any nation.	No
10609	And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.	Yes
6040	Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	Yes
1986	It means that Governor Romney...	No
24949	He raises his right hand and takes an oath to ensure the faithful implementation of the laws of the country.	No
7840	We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.	Yes
3962	You don't say that out loud.	No
17152	Whether you borrow the money or simply impose it on people, you take the same amount in the private sector, unless and until you reduce the government's share of what it takes.	No
346	I see the necessary funding, and I hope that Congress will fully fund this bill.	No
7157	It's to make sure we raise standards.	No
8154	It's the only way to move forward.	No
28801	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	Yes
33256	I'll defend Parenthood Planning.	No
23753	I have a plan that will help us kill and find the terrorists.	No
2051	If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	No
16063	I name people of independence, integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the House.	No
5891	Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
30073	And now they have oil everywhere, including oil - a lot of oil in Libya, which was another of its disasters.	No
32585	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
22772	I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	No
11469	The first priority must be to put an end to the violence and to alleviate the tensions that have arisen there.	No
15784	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not right now, Ann.	No
18445	I think it's important to tell the American people the truth.	No
20012	You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	Yes
13950	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	No
26782	And you can be part of our America and you can cross this bridge until the 21st century with us.	No
1692	It's not the one we've been working on, not the one the president describes as a tax cut for the rich.	No
17323	Let's take the example that the President cites.	No
25310	And despite politics, I stand where I am, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over, we're going to find a better bill, a more effective bill that does not violate the freedoms of our people.	No
8894	And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.	No
15153	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	No
21748	And the way you do things is to bury yourself in the room with each other, put together the best program, bring it to the American people, use the electronic city hall, the kind of thing you do here tonight, build a consensus, then do it and then move on to the next one.	No
21700	We need to give the police a chance to fight in our urban areas where gangs are accumulating.	No
34330	We've had people who are political hackers making the biggest transactions in the world, bigger than companies.	No
17124	And now we have a major question that the Americans must face to see if we are going to face this deficit and bring it down in the interest of a healthy recovery.	No
1470	And we have an unemployment rate of 35 percent in many parts of the country among construction workers.	Yes
1852	Donald Trump is a small business.	No
17424	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	No
17112	Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	Yes
10992	Maybe we could find out tonight.	No
21615	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	No
14381	And then after the group of the dirty Republican towers succeeded with me, I'm another person, which I consider to be an absolutely sick operation.	No
14820	I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.	No
33255	He even supported the closure of the government to defuse the Parenthood Planning.	Yes
2326	Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.	Yes
339	They're people who care, they're trying to give themselves up.	No
11798	We know that freedom is a powerful, powerful and powerful force, much greater than the United States of America, as we have seen recently in the Balkans.	No
21970	Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	Yes
5888	If I am interested in understanding my foreign policy, I join my second, Joe Biden, or Dick Lugar, the Republican member of the Senate Committee on External Relations, or General Jim Jones, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander.	No
3589	I was called the sheriff, by one of the senior members of the Credit Committee.	No
13609	Just the ground rules here.	No
19196	And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	No
142	And it allows - economists on the East and West coast think it's good - it allows the president to settle priorities, and we continue to grow because I'm not going to raise taxes.	No
2682	We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	No
15531	I made a good selection.	No
32628	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	No
23101	And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	No
21545	So, in principle, I'm going to take your point of view and think we should discuss child care or something else.	No
28753	They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	No
1441	More importantly, consumer confidence, as noted by the renowned University of Michigan organization, has been at the highest level since 1972.	Yes
12641	There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	Yes
31858	I can't believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I was a politician.	No
26806	Perhaps we will have another debate on the economy.	No
17173	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	No
6174	We offered you a chance to reach out.	No
29286	You can't bring back jobs.	No
24404	And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	No
14913	Moreover, the new energy policy is based on two factors: one is conservation, which requires sacrifices, and the other is the increase in American energy production, which is going very well - more coal this year than ever in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	Yes
19964	Did anyone complain when you raised the taxes?	No
5806	And of course, I'm talking about the economy.	No
6897	It's not a government plan.	No
10046	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	No
14400	Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.	Yes
12816	I have come to the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually collapsing.	No
1881	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 to 40 percent.	Yes
21164	You may want to focus on scandal.	No
19813	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	No
32074	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	No
27653	When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	No
12976	I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	No
9739	He didn't call for self-deportation.	No
13807	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	No
21394	I therefore believe that we must control the growth of compulsory expenditure, in return to the question of this gentleman.	No
18731	And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	No
12297	That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	No
361	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	Yes
8549	About one hundred to one hundred and one quarter billion of this is the result of government activity.	Yes
1386	The right of indigent or very poor accused to a lawyer.	No
11622	I wouldn't have supported either.	No
15716	We are moving forward with the negotiations and, you know, I just think it would be a stupid negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut one or the other of the two options right now.	No
7830	But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	No
31912	And I was embarrassed by it.	No
12071	And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	No
22905	But let me tell you where the President's policies put us.	No
16463	It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	Yes
16384	And we hope that we will serve you at the White House in January 1989.	No
1846	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	Yes
9271	Because the President has halved the number of permits and permits for drilling on federal lands and in federal waters.	Yes
6748	And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	Yes
19432	This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	No
27526	This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	No
21804	I've had more people who told me about their health problems than anything else, all over America -- you know, people who lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to quit their jobs because of sick children.	Yes
4162	Then let me do it.	No
7823	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	No
19981	It is about reviving the economy.	No
20786	$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
8536	And, in this respect, I think that we must look to the future with the fact that we are fighting communism in our country not only by our laws to deal with the communists, the few who become communists and the few who become travel companions, but also we are fighting communism in our country by walking against the various injustices that exist in our society on which the communists feed.	No
9393	I'd get rid of it.	No
26612	It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.	No
2641	I plan (inaudible) to grow.	No
18753	The president publicly overturned him while the president of South Korea was here.	Yes
21086	That's the difference of opinion.	No
22144	Now, the other superpowers have to do their part.	No
33011	The question concerned the Supreme Court.	No
17772	Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	No
5721	First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill on which I voted in the Senate was in favour of reform of criminal responsibility, which was not very popular with first-instance lawyers, an important constituency of the Democratic Party.	Yes
16027	The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	No
4111	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	Yes
23125	All of this can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: join me to reduce the president's unaffordable tax cut for people who earn more than $200,000 a year.	No
13384	I don't think we should have that kind of program.	No
18426	Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	No
1303	But it doesn't just take a calm, minimal enforcement of the law.	No
17895	Are we better of with this arms race?	No
14532	Well, how about that for a government reform policy?	No
19370	It took three and a half years.	Yes
23048	I wanted to do something.	No
18691	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	No
757	Now, it's good to say that sometimes you have to hit the base camps, but when the president saw this sponsored country-footprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American lives, he hit Libya.	Yes
13458	Because it is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to come out and explore for oil, to develop it.	No
22886	It works particularly when we pay our troops well.	No
26144	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	No
9705	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	Yes
25374	And if we did -- and I hope we can; we're always looking for -- and if we could find a weapon that makes these missiles obsolete?	No
32877	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	Yes
32944	We're back on the right track.	No
2290	Let me give you an example.	No
7213	You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	No
25154	And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	Yes
28055	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	No
26323	This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	No
16020	Andrea, I don't know what George Bush I'm listening to.	No
24139	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	No
8179	Where, then, do we disagree?	No
22964	You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.	No
1362	And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.	No
2424	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we haven't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	Yes
32922	So you can put it down, but it's a very effective form of communication.	No
19151	We come back and look at the health plan he wanted to impose on the American people.	No
658	We ought to say this is good.	No
29598	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	No
15908	Margaret, Kitty and I had the same kind of experience as the Bush: we lost a baby, lived 20 minutes after it was born.	No
21860	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	Yes
24125	I think it's a good decision - I took a little heat for her, but I think it was the right decision to make.	No
6942	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	No
12106	One, we need more community health centers.	No
13593	The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	Yes
30197	I have a winning temperament.	No
22845	We must now lead the world to combat proliferation as a whole.	No
27485	And it turns out that the work to implement these paralysing sanctions is laborious.	No
25318	There were a number of things that weakened this bill.	No
6368	Thanks again, Bob.	No
6212	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	No
3648	We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	No
22843	So what do we do?	No
27111	That's exactly what we're doing.	No
9485	We created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
22007	But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	No
16475	And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.	Yes
10926	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	No
28784	It's the best way to get people back into the system.	No
14683	"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."	Yes
22613	But September 11th changed everything.	No
19132	It's a big order, but I've been fighting odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here tonight.	No
29375	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	No
4003	All those who were around, and who had been there, and knew about it that it was a failed state.	No
10987	They are certainly small business people and others, and they understand this responsibility.	No
18338	Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	Yes
18821	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	Yes
28925	And in some cases may be still at large.	No
6520	Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	No
22868	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	Yes
13143	I think we should strengthen our conventional forces, and we should try in January, February and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	No
19944	I believe that we have to do these things with a smaller and less bureaucratic government, but we still have to do them.	No
19159	I carry a small card in my pocket, called the tenth amendment.	No
33092	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	No
15627	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	No
16731	We do not have an adequate requirement for house insulation, for the efficiency of automobiles.	No
25029	They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	No
17368	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	No
236	NIH is doing a good job of research.	No
24384	They didn't go over to coddle.	No
23549	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	Yes
34140	There's gonna be more deaths than they thought.	No
7050	It is not to increase the scope of the federal government.	No
25709	I have a simple philosophy that I have tried to follow over the last four years: doing what creates opportunities for all, which reinforces the responsibility of all of us, and what will help us build a community where everyone has a role to play and a place at the table.	No
21256	An important way to look at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	No
24317	We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	No
17401	There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.	No
25780	Grouping people together is obviously a responsibility that we all have.	No
26050	The third time we sent the welfare reform to the president, he signed it but announced that he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line veto that I never understood, but it's a little inside baseball.	Yes
2445	And there are ways to do it.	No
24330	There is no doubt about that.	No
25028	I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	No
16399	This election is about great things.	No
9037	Before I begin my final remarks here, I would just like to stress a concern that I had that we have criticized Carter's failures here quite considerably, both of us tonight.	No
10635	And you know what you'll find?	No
15934	And you see, I think we are facing a real opportunity for world peace.	No
1382	And I would introduce the same kind of procedure as the President, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	No
32706	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	No
22442	Congress -- they're all good people.	No
33703	China is growing by 7%.	Yes
30216	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but that was not enough.	Yes
5918	Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	No
28558	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	No
976	And the best America is not behind us.	No
8894	And I heard them asking for something that would give them hope.	No
17903	And when we tried to attack social security and health insurance, as the file we did shows, I think it was mean.	No
26761	Well, I hope I made my answer clear.	No
27083	But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	No
5885	Now, the reason I think it's important to get these facts simply because Senator McCain's constant allegation is that my associations are somewhat troubling.	No
24934	But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	Yes
28807	Contracts must be smaller, agencies must be - must recruit and work hard to find people to bid on government contracts.	No
8592	Here's a place where I think our program is doing a better job than its own.	No
22221	But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	No
26701	Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	No
33273	Well, I think it's terrible.	No
9014	I believe in freedom of choice.	No
6092	It is not and I just described it...	No
15440	I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	No
20711	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who has shown the ability to do things?	No
33494	Hillary, you have no idea.	No
7427	And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	No
24259	So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	No
58	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
13393	I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	No
13312	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who believe in God must unite.	No
6461	The measurement is not: Are we safer?	No
8045	In my opinion, it was the same kind of wool thinking that led to a disaster for America in Korea.	No
32333	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	No
8444	I voted in favour of this proposal and I strongly supported it, because I think it helped our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control, and it was on this vote that Mr Nixon and I did not agree, and his vote on equal terms, uh, rejected his break in equality and rejected the proposal.	Yes
6343	And we're going to find and we're going to spend the money, the research, to find the cause of autism.	No
28323	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	No
23788	The great threat to our country is that these haters will eventually have weapons of mass destruction.	No
22861	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	No
28910	Some of the toughest times since I was Governor of the State of Texas are dealing with these cases.	No
13732	I can't protect an Arkansas company, notice him, governor.	No
13134	The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	Yes
22296	I just had a word of clarification because of what Governor Clinton said.	No
19137	That, to me, is the key.	No
27072	It's their route to the sea.	No
12452	And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	No
1418	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	No
22564	Here in St. Louis, you fired 350 teachers.	Yes
11323	My wife, Michelle, is here and she could give you a much longer list than I am.	No
25014	I think we are very interested in the Pacific basin.	No
26015	So it would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with social security; have a bipartite group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	No
1115	And I do not believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went to Yugoslavia.	No
1589	Secrets should be removed from government and maximum privacy should be maintained.	No
12200	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	Yes
20225	We know how to set agendas.	No
10648	And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	Yes
32085	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	Yes
27680	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	No
24664	Number one, if I get there, it'll be a very unusual and historic event.	No
26904	And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	No
21856	You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	No
764	And I said mistakes were made.	No
26955	And -- and they are through many nations in the Middle East.	No
32234	We're going to be able to.	No
17860	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	Yes
25617	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	No
10548	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	No
11417	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	No
13024	Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	Yes
29831	And it was terminated by current mayor.	Yes
12909	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	No
17374	As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.	No
20166	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	No
25698	But in any case, I understand the problems.	No
27247	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	Yes
7791	And if India were to lose its battle, with thirty-five percent of the population of the underdeveloped world within its borders, then I think that the balance of power could be achieved against us.	Yes
7765	The United States Congress opened six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars of mare which the President was ready to use until a week ago.	Yes
12639	I have seen us ignore Africa.	No
11418	And I don't think that's the kind of exaggeration we're proud of as Americans.	No
12173	So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	No
24171	Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.	No
24470	And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	No
8192	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	No
2947	It seems to me that we can go from there to the sale of cereals.	No
18660	We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	No
22642	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	Yes
21715	I'm probably going to fight in this room with a few, but it turns out that we need more severe death sentences for those who kill police officers.	No
596	And he just lifted martial law.	Yes
33090	Well, I will certainly, because I think this is a very fair and important issue.	No
15420	As I studied the file between me and Governor Reagan, I was impressed by the blatant differences that exist between us.	No
26552	First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.	No
16540	I think taxpayers are the ones who need the relief: I don't think we should add other programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter is talking about.	No
17653	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	Yes
15381	Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	No
26588	But these are important questions.	No
586	But now we have a chance.	No
14055	But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.	No
17008	Our system of government - despite Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	No
15173	But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	No
7675	These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	No
24307	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	No
10679	Now I've listed the things I think I should be at the top of the list.	No
25418	Because this ever-increasing madness of arms race makes the two nations less secure.	No
12140	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on uninsured people in the State of Texas.	Yes
5838	"But saying in one way or another that this group of young women who said ""military wives for McCain"" says something derogating about you, but all that is -- and those veterans who wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to defend myself against people who say that the people who come to my gatherings are everything but the most dedicated patriotic men and women in this nation and that they are great citizens."	No
19360	They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	No
34229	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	No
10628	The situation is now called bipartite.	No
1425	But now let's talk about the extras that came out this week.	No
34055	The FBI ran a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	Yes
24978	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	No
12920	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	No
26659	But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	No
22012	One thing I called for has been blocked, and I will continue to work for it, is a whole law of financial reform.	No
16505	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including my opponent, was to accumulate taxes on low-income people to remove them from corporations.	No
10931	So here's what I would do.	No
1787	They can buy a computer for their child going to university, which means they spend more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	Yes
24614	So I think the appeal is yes, we care.	No
3078	And this terrible circumstance in this country is exported abroad.	No
334	I think that would help in terms of shelter.	No
2917	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	No
8558	I think, however, that what we need to do is that the President and leadership be placed before our country exactly what we need to do in the next decade, if we are to maintain our security in education, economic growth, and the development of natural resources.	No
4108	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	No
18707	My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	No
17788	But I'm also telling you now, social security has nothing to do with the deficit.	Yes
8169	And I think that ultimately depends on what we're doing here.	No
28661	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	No
27411	And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	No
3818	We hadn't caught bin Laden.	Yes
6150	Under Senator McCain's plan, people are at high risk of losing their employer-based health care.	Yes
13657	According to his own analysis, unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 as part of his plan than it is today.	Yes
11364	It is a great honour for me to serve him for many years.	No
19779	That's why we're going in the right direction.	No
3731	It doesn't work better with private insurers.	No
14847	In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	Yes
10182	We are not going to eliminate all those who are mentally disturbed and we must make sure that they do not have weapons.	No
7763	Nineteen fifty-three of us tried to put a $5 billion appropriation for our defenses.	Yes
23945	You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.	Yes
19701	Now we have thousands and thousands of refugees.	Yes
1609	But I believe that we can now establish a good relationship with Congress at the White House, a good relationship with our people, setting very high goals for our country.	No
12077	But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.	No
19793	Maybe in your case, just two.	No
26188	So let me say that.	No
2592	The proof is that we have gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	Yes
99	And then call all those pickets out there trying to demolish seven different administrations.	No
15083	When I made my decision to stop any trade with Iran following the taking of our hostages, I then announced, and I have always maintained it since, that if the hostages were released safely, we would also deliver the items that Iran owns - which it bought and paid - and that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	Yes
19894	Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	No
13634	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	No
16641	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we have made a fairly significant reduction in the number of White House employees working for the President.	Yes
8915	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	Yes
19894	Where we don't have much money at the federal level to spend on education, we should spend it to help the 90% of the children we can help.	No
2755	You will have 4 million people who will lose the Medicare advantage.	Yes
12708	Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	No
12454	I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	No
30160	The minutes do not show that.	Yes
8240	It's a question of which administration is doing the right thing.	No
25323	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have rooted their roots and who have lived here even if they have sometimes returned illegally.	No
23250	Do you know what he presented to us?	No
8322	I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	No
21614	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	No
17558	That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.	Yes
12475	This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	No
12650	Mr. Nixon says we are the strongest country in the world.	No
13488	The United States cannot continue to bear most of this burden on its own.	No
23145	The federal government will manage it.	No
1190	Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	No
16409	And I will be a good president.	No
15339	I think it is outrageous that the Social Security Disability Insurance Fund finds cheques that go every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or mental illness, and that they receive social security disability cheques every month while a state institution provides all their needs and care.	Yes
27339	We take program after program that we don't have to absolutely have, and we get rid of it.	No
13476	Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	No
17627	And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	Yes
14411	No one did this with a bad intention.	No
3096	The unemployment rate was below 4 per cent.	Yes
12643	We haven't recognized them in two months; the American ambassador hasn't come in nearly eight months.	Yes
10582	They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	No
13010	But let's look at it.	No
32977	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	No
457	I didn't pay the penalties.	No
13146	Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	No
29320	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that happened to the manufacturing industry.	Yes
8698	In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	Yes
24573	I grew up in the separated South, fortunately raised by a grandfather without formal education but with a heart of gold that taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	No
3167	I think militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	No
1023	These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	No
7040	People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.	Yes
23651	It's not that simple.	No
271	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	No
27467	I'd charge him with that.	No
33101	And I want to bring all this experience to the White House and do it every day.	No
16153	We ought to have rural enterprise zones.	No
3551	I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	Yes
29479	... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	No
7977	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	No
33029	And you look at our miners.	No
13448	Especially some of the small producers.	No
1109	In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	No
17290	And I think that if we want to continue - as I do - to have a religious nation, we must keep that line and never cross it.	No
26001	First of all, there are two different things.	No
26938	Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	No
11775	As I said, the people of the world come together, they look at us.	No
32743	Why would these people stay here?	No
22083	You have to do this, we have to lower those costs.	No
10854	I traveled around the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and me.	Yes
27698	Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	No
12644	I think the world is changing fast.	No
12939	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
7917	That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	No
20635	Whether or not our forces are high morale, high standing and well equipped.	No
14875	In addition, the formation of military forces is good for our country because we must have military forces to preserve peace.	No
7678	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	No
1508	And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.	No
17232	So, if he had had his way, there would have been no housing projects there.	No
28308	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	No
12512	Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	No
24193	Health care, schools, one on debt and deficit.	No
27585	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	Yes
21076	Now, Social Security has never done that.	Yes
30012	I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
27450	It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	Yes
27928	I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.	Yes
11238	Georgia, in particular, is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	No
29373	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
12526	And at the end of those seven years, we were engaged in a war in Korea that cost the lives of thirty thousand Americans.	Yes
24116	And with this new convention coming up, the jamming will disappear, and I'll sit with them and say it's done.	No
3153	I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
24673	And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	No
17161	I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	No
9909	He called Arizona law a model for the nation.	No
29923	Well, that was very -- I'm not saying anything.	No
17153	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	No
26817	We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	No
13717	I'd like America to have that kind of record, and I think most of the people who look at us tonight would like us to have more jobs and less spending on the government.	No
28190	We share a common border with another nation.	No
10734	I believe in the need for increased oil production.	No
18018	If we give them a chance to be free, they'll run to the polls.	No
11813	And I was surprised by the magnitude of that.	No
14315	So we're making dramatic progress.	No
13619	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	Yes
13261	Now, why did they reject it?	No
3962	You don't say that out loud.	No
969	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	No
23231	One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	Yes
9482	I'm ready to sign this ticket.	No
704	A general of the Air Force not so long ago in Europe said that soon we would have aircraft without engines, tank commanders who cannot drive their tanks more than three quarters of a mile, because they do not have enough fuel.	Yes
19259	I vetoed this bill because it further reduced the health insurance system and was fundamentally at risk of breaking the system.	Yes
422	There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	No
18362	Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	No
8465	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	Yes
29884	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	No
21913	It caused me to disrupt my privacy and my business to get involved in this activity.	No
29121	You must judge us, who can assume the immense and impressive responsibilities of the presidency, which can implement the plans that will make your life better.	No
5999	In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.	No
25008	Ah, well, now you added a hypothesis there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we were going to send troops to fight.	No
25146	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	No
24369	We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	Yes
33633	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	No
14415	Let us take Mr Bush for the moment, he is right, we have no proof at least that our government has told Saddam Hussein that he could have this part of Kuwait.	Yes
7348	We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
487	One of the reasons, and I'd like to know first what programs you're talking about, and then we could talk about the merits of the programs.	No
15754	And we also have important national priorities in education, housing and health care, economic development, vocational training and the environment.	No
7329	If you look at what happened -- we've made progress, I mean that at the same time.	No
17024	It takes more than the same thing.	No
358	This is another fundamental difference that I have with the Vice-President, as in the case of health care for 37 million family members who work in this country and who do not have health insurance.	Yes
20737	I think we need to put Medicare and social security in a safe.	No
26822	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years to come.	No
8783	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	Yes
22724	He's talking about a great idea: let's make a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by organizing a summit.	Yes
2485	Innermountain Healthcare does it beautifully, Mayo Clinic does it beautifully, Cleveland Clinic, others.	Yes
3773	We have to obviously cut spending.	No
1231	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	Yes
34141	But the leaders we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	No
2381	I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	Yes
6723	As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	No
18697	Now, if preemption is finally what has to happen, I don't know yet.	No
19369	The 50 States have done so.	Yes
12477	I want to do something about Social Security.	No
22941	Eight countries have left it.	Yes
19978	They're having a hard time making ends meet.	No
2605	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	No
10602	But I think it's important to remember a little history.	No
34064	This is -- this is a mindset.	No
16870	And one last comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all the inequalities that exist in the current law.	No
426	And that is one of the reasons why my state has reduced the crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	Yes
17657	We didn't think that was right.	No
21706	In Houston, there has been a 15 per cent drop in the crime rate over the past year due to the mayor's work there to increase the police.	Yes
18453	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	No
8942	Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.	No
12916	I therefore hope that Senator Kennedy, in his response today, will clarify it.	No
28443	Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	No
23916	Then let's admit it.	No
29147	But we must prevent our jobs from being stolen from us.	No
3329	Just Monday this week, I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent U.S. companies from taking a tax deduction if they had in any way cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
26750	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	No
24078	Because we've managed our country so badly over the years, and now it's time to pay for the violin.	No
9226	That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	Yes
19723	It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	No
26366	The bill originally covered 25 or more employers, but because of the opposition, we went up to 50.	Yes
16438	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	No
19483	Senator Dole led the fight against Bill Brady.	Yes
15808	I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	No
7467	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	No
29953	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent or your campaign sent photos of him in a certain dress, very famous photos.	Yes
7676	About two per cent of our white population is illiterate, ten per cent of our colour population.	Yes
3716	And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	Yes
1208	The automobile emissions - uh - were agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of UAW, and by the heads of the entire automotive industry, we had work and management together saying that these auto emission standards had to be changed.	Yes
22116	And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	No
1782	And that's exactly what I did.	Yes
19816	So what we want to do is call opportunity grants.	No
8535	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	No
34128	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	No
27801	And if we don't invest in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	Yes
32853	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	No
15246	And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	No
8185	this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	Yes
25263	The so-called negotiation that you said I left was the so-called march in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it was not I who refused, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	Yes
15208	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	Yes
26963	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	Yes
633	As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	No
236	The NIH is doing a good job in research.	No
12315	China and India were exempted from that treaty.	Yes
12839	And as far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be introduced inside, it should be accepted only if the negotiations have reached the point where we have reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than a false spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever.	No
17202	In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	No
2801	We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	No
24046	They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	No
21327	It's a scary tactic, because it's not that much.	No
27777	They sell us about all this every year, and we sell them about it every year.	No
8623	I think we're ready to move.	No
17123	It was instead a deficit of $200 billion.	Yes
9520	Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	No
26693	I'm proud we're better off with this than we were four years ago.	No
28987	And you bet we're going to take a trillion dollars from your own money and let you invest it according to safe guidelines so that you get a better rate of return on the money than the small 2% the federal government gets for you today.	Yes
342	There are certain bases of the army that the act requires that can be used in some cases to shelter people when it's hard.	Yes
28123	Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	No
6972	And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.	No
189	And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.	No
10150	But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.	No
7251	I remember flying to Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and guards travelling abroad from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	No
24359	The second largest surplus next to Japan.	Yes
7834	But I do not expect it to come.	No
18519	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	No
17656	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	Yes
7782	We have paid more military aid, more aid to Laos per person than in any country in the world, and we must now know that Laos is moving away from neutralism towards communists.	Yes
26615	Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	Yes
2654	I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	No
7626	I think we should be stronger than we are now.	No
3927	And I understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the push succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	No
18215	And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	No
14066	All these things take a few minutes.	No
33221	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	Yes
32322	People come to our country as if we had no idea who they are, where they come from, what they feel about our country, and she wants 550 percent more.	Yes
22117	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear freeze group, you remember -- freeze it, in the late 1970s -- freeze it, don't touch it; we'll lock it now or otherwise we'll have war.	No
8660	Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	No
12392	I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	No
23659	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a partial abortion ban at birth?	No
12904	He says he supports the President's position.	Yes
18447	And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	No
9323	How much did you cut them, then?	No
22941	Eight countries left her.	Yes
29867	Well, I... I think...	No
20067	And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	No
26912	Our hearts and minds go to them.	No
11710	But I think it should be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	No
3008	These are the weaknesses I see, and I believe it is not just a question of idealism.	No
6908	I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	Yes
29443	The Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	Yes
26660	We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.	Yes
8374	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	No
1886	This is by far the most effective and effective way to balance this budget.	No
12700	Mr. Nixon is misinformed.	No
17645	She started to decline, but she's still on the rise.	Yes
12593	He said he was Cuba's second most powerful man.	No
5576	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	Yes
24617	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	No
7932	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	No
6271	Right now, I'm meeting young people across the country who have decided not to go to university or if they go to university, they're taking $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 in debt, and it's very difficult for them to go to certain areas, such as basic science research, for example, thinking about themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	Yes
25489	But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	No
16011	And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	No
21877	He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.	Yes
12346	It's an interruption, by the way.	No
2661	This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	No
1491	And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that's taken on election day.	No
14765	Who is the best person to get results and not talk?	No
7784	This allows them to maintain their self-respect.	No
34420	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	No
33218	This does not run counter to sensible and reasonable regulation.	No
14986	You have to see it to believe it.	No
22148	And if nothing else turns you on to rebuild our industrial base, maybe it will because the job is to get our people back to work.	No
1508	And I think we will have good results on 2 November for myself and I hope for the country.	No
7607	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	Yes
6405	It will force us all - Democrats, Republicans, Independents - to come together and renew a spirit of sacrifice, service and responsibility.	No
21231	It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.	No
1404	And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.	No
8247	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	No
24136	I firmly believe that our education problem in America 2000 is the answer - a little longer term; it will take some time to educate.	No
3184	But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	No
34207	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	No
14888	In 1974, we experienced a so-called oil shock, in which OPEC's oil price was increased to an extraordinary degree.	Yes
21498	It has more than 100 billion tax cuts and incentives.	Yes
4104	These preconditions would apply that we would not legitimize a face-to-face encounter, a person like Ahmadinejad.	No
8047	I would never tolerate her as President of the United States, and I hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he is elected.	No
20296	That's why I was critical of the administration.	No
28843	You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	No
28859	If you win more than $60,000 and up to $100, you will still get a game, but not as generous.	Yes
17818	Growth is just over 3 percent now.	Yes
25146	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	No
7159	"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We're going to raise standards."	Yes
3113	I was the first president of the United States to visit Japan.	No
29925	He should have produced it long before.	No
19535	You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.	Yes
14676	And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	Yes
6949	That's double the amount my predecessor has increased VA funding.	Yes
7652	I think we all agree that when someone has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under this contract should also be paid regardless of the race, creed or colour of the individual to be employed.	No
9275	The administration has brought criminal proceedings against the people who dig for oil, this massive new resource we have.	No
21400	Well, we're four trillion dollars in debt.	Yes
15752	We will have conventional forces that are well-maintained, well-equipped, well-trained, well-supported.	No
28740	Now we must tackle one of the greatest threats to our democracy.	No
21223	Thank you to the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	No
25609	America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.	No
2616	This seems to be a trend.	No
17210	I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	No
15964	But it is the Internal Revenue Service that now estimates that we do not collect $100 billion or more of taxes due in this country.	Yes
15713	And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	No
17968	I believe that America is the safest and strongest when we lead the world and make strong alliances.	No
16168	Is it almost you remember that expression, getting lead out?	No
19618	No one in the world agrees with our policy towards Cuba.	No
28717	But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	No
14713	And it's not the tax and spending of the economy.	No
2840	I think it is in the best interest of the United States, and of the world as a whole, that the United States negotiate rather than return to the cold war relationship with the Soviet Union.	No
27760	It's not my mandate, it's the president's Secretary of Defense who called them devastating.	Yes
8509	I am not saying that the Democrats are united in their support for the programme.	No
4005	Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	Yes
19816	So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	No
356	But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	No
24428	Of course, we care about people, we care about children, we care about tragedy.	No
7605	Third, Arthur Gardner, Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, Republican Ambassador, said successively over the past six weeks that they had reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist and that they had not achieved effective results.	Yes
1427	We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	Yes
13423	He suggested that we help regions in distress.	No
8750	So I think, yes, we will have to change very appreciably, some of the lifestyles we now enjoy.	No
12668	We want freedom to gain.	No
12725	I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	No
2868	I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	No
10339	I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	No
1548	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	No
10037	You know I mean what I'm saying.	No
2043	You'll never balance the budget by increasing taxes.	No
25271	Now we have an arms race.	No
22569	I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fund it entirely.	No
13316	We cannot have it in our hearts.	No
860	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	No
18939	I will do so in four years' time, and I will immediately begin bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
25851	And it's time we looked at the pay scales.	No
25984	But don't get into that smokescreen, Oscar.	No
13385	Then he says he's gonna change the interest rate situation and we're gonna have more money like that.	No
19985	I think the government can do better.	No
346	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	No
32461	And she could have done that years ago, by the way.	No
13930	Let's think about it.	No
17703	I'm against it, too.	No
20983	And I'd find a game plan to deal with it.	No
12577	Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.	Yes
2964	Each of these countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not recognize that these countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	Yes
22016	And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.	No
32275	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	No
24374	We were the first to impose sanctions.	Yes
19639	Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.	Yes
26129	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless your house is worth more than $500,000.	Yes
13849	We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.	Yes
20996	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	Yes
28112	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	No
28555	If we're keeping someone -- you know, using a weapon illegally, there must be a consequence.	No
920	I want to expand our markets abroad and that is why I called for this first economic summit on agriculture.	No
5687	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	Yes
7443	And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.	No
8689	prudent projections for the next five years, indicating that this plan would result in a balanced budget by 1983.	No
18605	The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.	Yes
22904	Daniel, I don't support a project.	No
25015	That's where I think the future of the world is.	No
26459	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	No
2601	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- of course, at the state level and at the local level.	No
20143	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	No
7158	Look, the No Child Left Behind Act is really an act of employment when you think about it.	No
28932	I don't think you should support the death penalty to avenge yourself.	No
27386	The Navy said it needed 313 ships to carry out its mission.	Yes
2734	I know it's bigger than an election about both of us as individuals.	No
1243	Unfortunately, this has not been done.	No
1743	At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.	Yes
29042	You ain't seen nothing yet.	No
16907	I think that would be contrary to one of the fundamental concepts of our system of government - a counterweight system.	No
16059	And I'm very proud of it.	No
13427	And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	Yes
22863	Let me talk about North Korea.	No
20359	I'm beginning to think not only that he invented the Internet, but that he invented the calculator.	No
32517	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	No
24090	I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.	No
10124	So, I think, (A), we have to enforce the laws we already have, make sure that we keep the weapons out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We have done much better in background checks, but we have more to do in law enforcement.	No
19860	I was a strong force for reform.	No
13616	Government -- he says invest government, grow government.	No
18968	And I think it is very important for the American President, as well as for other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help people to realize their hopes, aspirations and dreams.	No
11825	But it is very important not to go beyond our limits and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated and honourable citizens who do their jobs, put their lives at risk, and who are not fanatical or have no prejudice.	No
19161	That's my difference with the President.	No
17429	There are other things that have been said here -- back, and you said I could pick them up.	No
2018	Well, the economy is still growing slow.	Yes
16383	We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	No
24755	I don't have time to talk about our health care reform plan in 30 seconds.	No
9086	The question of our natural resources, the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	No
5853	And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	No
2366	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	No
32496	And many things have to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, about the highest in the world.	Yes
25623	The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.	No
3045	The Shanghai Communique says that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other will be resolved by peaceful means.	Yes
25234	But you need more than that.	No
32761	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	No
6880	Again, the president deceives America.	No
14548	And give it to the president, and if Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a chance of this excessive spending.	No
2149	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	No
24565	In athletics, we know that.	No
2912	We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.	Yes
2025	That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	Yes
8153	And I think that's the only way the United States will maintain its freedom.	No
8746	We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.	No
9865	We welcome legal immigrants to this country.	No
13266	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon spoke - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote, ""American boys in Indochina."""	Yes
15451	Do you think our security is as safe as we were four years ago?	No
955	Who has the experience that we trust?	No
21339	The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	No
18815	We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	Yes
4245	In April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	No
28504	The governor is proposing $45 billion.	Yes
25848	This shouldn't happen in America.	No
29795	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	No
18099	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	No
17005	I don't pretend to know all the answers.	No
13292	Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
19582	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	Yes
5747	It's about fighting for a HMO patient's declaration of rights.	No
18218	America must have been safe.	No
14848	This is a very good step forward for the security of our country, and we will continue to do what we have done in the past.	No
27489	Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	No
17874	And then you add to this food and to this wardrobe, and all the other things, and you have only a small portion going for the weapons.	No
34044	And in that regard, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	No
16608	Our country does not now have a comprehensive energy programme or policy.	Yes
25791	And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.	No
34269	Thank you so much for doing a great job.	No
24241	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	Yes
15892	And I said, what can we do about it.	No
30338	I'll go very fast.	No
6561	But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	No
3242	I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	No
29456	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	No
15440	I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	No
3782	And I have plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and unnecessary spending and if there is someone here who thinks there are no government agencies where spending can be reduced and their budgets reduced, they haven't spent much time in Washington.	No
7703	We must practice what we preach.	No
15346	So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	No
10257	If we have more people hired, if we get back to manufacturing jobs, if we get back to all kinds of jobs in this country, then you're going to see income increase again.	No
9608	We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	Yes
1560	The main objective of a presidential election is to choose a leader.	No
34173	Mosul is on the border with Syria.	No
945	The best poverty reduction programme is decent employment in the private sector.	No
22861	And that is why we are doing what he suggested: bring the British, the Germans and the French to show the Iranians very clearly that if they expect to be a party in the world to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	No
6346	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	Yes
23023	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	No
14016	Now that we've talked about the problem of free trade, let's go back to the centre of the bull's eye.	No
17279	I have a deep religious faith.	No
4072	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	No
14301	But look who's around with him there.	No
14548	And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	No
11809	I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.	No
11851	It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.	No
13351	But to say exactly what I think, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	No
26632	See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	No
30124	And I think it's great.	No
25806	So this is, that's a good start.	No
9736	You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	No
15793	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	No
30126	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	No
23915	"And they all say, ""Well, that was a long time ago."""	No
9069	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	No
24550	This is a relevant question here tonight.	No
10500	Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.	No
24058	And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	Yes
21304	We have sent millions of jobs abroad and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after serving for some time you cash, become a foreign lobbyist, earn $30,000 a month, then take a vacation, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you have good contacts and then go back outside.	Yes
19562	It cost us billions and billions of dollars for peacekeeping operations.	Yes
25307	And inevitably, they will be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	No
21505	Don't do it -- you don't have to believe it.	No
17787	I told you I'd never do such a thing.	No
34104	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	No
3692	We've got to invest in science and technology.	No
2648	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	Yes
33321	It's just pouring out and destroying their youth.	No
945	The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	No
18754	And the president of South Korea returned to disoriented and embarrassed South Korea because it went against his policy.	No
23106	Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	No
2973	And I would like to see Mr Ford convince the Polish-Americans, the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that these countries do not live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron Curtain.	No
19405	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	Yes
17904	When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.	Yes
33996	And all of his donors -- almost all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	Yes
14869	Now, Gerald Ford has left a five-year plan for a military reinforcement to restore our defences, and President Carter's administration has reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships off from the proposed Navy construction program, and stopped the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and is now planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various locations around the world that makes me question its assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to seek the use of force.	Yes
25315	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	Yes
7768	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favour of the admission of Red China to the United Nations.	Yes
8755	That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.	Yes
18732	And I think this will work.	No
30406	Where did you find this?	No
14743	To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.	No
19591	When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	No
29430	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	No
17014	I believe that we can work together.	No
16850	But if you could get rid of those who are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	No
28702	I was just hanging out.	No
26731	The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer at school, in my opinion, would be an excellent idea.	No
7780	And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	Yes
20094	So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.	No
1086	But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	Yes
11650	One of the criteria that, in my opinion, is important in deciding when and if we should be involved around the world is whether or not our interest in national security is involved, whether we can really make a difference with military forces.	No
17520	I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	No
686	We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	No
12703	Secondly, I believe that if economic sanctions against Latin America succeed, they must be multilateral.	No
21389	He tells you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a $1,000 tax or something.	No
19212	That's what I want to focus on.	No
16137	We should certainly be able to do so.	No
29646	And when we talk about your business, you went bankrupt six times.	Yes
2167	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they will not take more patients into the health care plan.	Yes
8341	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	No
16544	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers over the last eight years, and imposing a heavier tax burden on those in higher tax brackets, plus the other measures that have been taken, we can provide taxpayers with adequate tax relief.	Yes
21095	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.	No
13868	We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	No
18898	Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.	No
26661	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	No
878	We shouldn't do that.Â€°Â¤ That's the kind of vice president I want.	No
11356	I know what it's like in dark times.	No
12970	And I believe that if we can get a party that believes in the movement, that believes in the future, then we can restore our position in the world - a strong defence, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, the co-guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then all over the world, especially to try to restore the atmosphere that existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
7709	Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	No
1667	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	No
17118	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our time is what we are doing about these huge deficits.	No
17013	And I believe that we can bind our wounds.	No
16619	We have established eighty-four new mental health treatment centres.	Yes
13594	Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	No
28188	And we have uninsured people in my condition.	No
8823	or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	Yes
56	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	Yes
32032	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	Yes
3967	I can see how tough that terrain is.	No
18448	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	No
2918	But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	No
25249	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	No
29724	We need to restore law and order.	No
12183	I believe him when he says he has a good heart.	No
7846	I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	Yes
34104	I hope that the hard work of the American military advisers will be profitable and that we will see a truly successful military operation.	No
23915	"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago."""	No
521	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and young people and save money at the same time.	No
24675	Americans are bright, intelligent, caring and loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	No
11851	It's gonna be hard to punish them worse after they've been killed.	No
1599	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	No
34345	In 1987, he published a $100,000 announcement in the New York Times, when President Reagan was president, and said exactly what he just said, that we were the laughing stock of the world.	Yes
32774	I would go after Baghdadi.	No
12528	We ended the Korean war; by a strong and firm leadership that we kept out of other wars; and we avoided the surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	Yes
25854	Fifty times, we have deployed troops all over the world.	Yes
8294	Well, because I think if the federal government had left the program and withdrawn its support, then I think you'd have complete economic chaos.	No
10497	I love Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be there on the market.	No
7639	This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.	No
32085	And more importantly, it was after receiving a subpoena.	Yes
6550	If every family in America were to commit, as the honourable senator suggested, if it would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	No
28741	And this is the current system of campaign financing.	No
3074	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	Yes
27258	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	No
29917	But since she can't bring back work, she can't produce.	No
18517	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	No
21608	I went to a boys' club.	No
94	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	Yes
19404	But let's look at the overall record.	No
25008	Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	No
7716	"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	No
33045	We have to keep our energy companies.	No
16342	But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	No
14962	This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.	No
17588	Today, it is up to $38,000 in salary that is subject to the social security wage tax.	Yes
19936	I'm not even sure you're too excited about it.	No
17867	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	Yes
34420	And I think we will be able to get control of fee spending through more resources and more difficult decisions.	No
29526	I said, have you been audited?	No
26369	He said it was a mistake.	No
18546	Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.	No
1917	And we talk about evidence.	No
9291	Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	Yes
30103	Well, I have to respond.	No
28518	And so prevent the war from happening first.	No
13767	I've been talking since the first day.	No
2175	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	No
22131	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, those that can hit us.	No
19406	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	Yes
16175	But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.	No
9734	And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	No
30073	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	No
28827	And by the way, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity, but because of it.	No
33761	Let me ask a simple question.	No
24934	But in one way or another, there were original copies 12 that came down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	Yes
25824	17 new taxes, spending $1.5 trillion, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
10074	That's not what we do.	No
17157	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: It would never diminish profits.	Yes
13903	But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	No
27256	In fact, the economy of Latin America is almost as large as that of China.	Yes
11173	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who was joking with me, about Iran.	No
11679	But listen, Jim, the world is changing so fast.	No
24302	And we focused on tactics.	No
17967	But we just have a different set of beliefs about how you make America safe.	No
2490	This is explicitly prohibited by law.	Yes
8456	While you take the bills...	No
25189	Thirdly, is it even necessary for the President to be so closely involved in the strategic details?	No
28233	I think parents will be more involved in education when they know their children's classrooms are safe.	No
19907	Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	No
12272	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	No
8694	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	Yes
7924	I would not meet with Mr Khrushchev unless there were agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - that would indicate that the meeting would have some hope for success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	No
29219	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	No
22134	We must therefore stay above that and help them constructively to move towards democracy and capitalism.	No
17657	We didn't think it was fair.	No
19297	I want the government to squeeze pennies for a change instead of American families.	No
25075	There's a big difference between the two of us.	No
8826	I have just received a report from the Air Force indicating that the cost of the 30-year life cycle of this system will be $100 billion.	Yes
6119	And this is your plan, John.	No
32262	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	No
10665	We can work on nuclear power plants.	No
955	Who has the experience we trust?	No
12881	They want to be free.	No
2074	In the end, we're going to have to make a few decisions.	No
10728	You know, many of you remember the tragedy of September 11 and where you were that day and, you know, how the whole country was ready to come together and make huge changes not only to make us safer, but also to make us a better country and a more unified country.	No
20757	He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	Yes
14342	And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	No
7109	Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	No
2332	I'm sorry, but it's not -- it's not the facts.	No
20612	But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	No
28421	You mean eight years?	No
26062	You have two years to look for a job.	No
26687	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	Yes
1499	I have never depended on powerful political figures to put myself in power.	No
11160	I therefore agree that we must speak responsibly and act responsibly.	No
26389	We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	No
20627	It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	No
3316	This is the first time I remember our country's history when we let a foreign country bypass or amend our Bill of Rights.	Yes
24858	We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.	No
25891	Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.	No
26930	As far as Libya is concerned, as I mentioned in the last debate, when we received this telephone call, I immediately ensured that, number one, we were doing everything in our power to ensure the safety of the Americans who were still in danger; number two, that we were investigating exactly what happened, and number three, the most important, that we were going after those who killed the Americans and that we were bringing them to justice.	Yes
20142	First of all, Jim, let me thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for listening tonight to the opportunity you gave us to appear.	No
398	This is the kind of presidency I believe in.	No
18900	We have to do this job.	No
23558	Let me make sure you understand my decision.	No
11328	I know I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the fact that this country gave me the opportunity.	No
24189	Convert capitalism from the 19th to the 21st century.	No
25432	But when you keep warning him -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	No
2320	What have we done?	No
24920	That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	No
20154	Friends, we can build this bridge until the 21st century, big enough and strong enough for us all to cross, and I hope you will help me build it.	No
3055	As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.	Yes
12611	Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?	No
437	Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	No
17350	They don't want this arms race.	No
8446	But if the money goes to the states and the states can then determine whether it goes for the construction of schools or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority on the school board and the school committee.	No
23040	And that's what we do.	No
766	That is a very serious charge against the president.	No
11160	So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.	No
13172	There must be an absolute guarantee.	No
7492	And I think we're both very lucky.	No
12848	I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	No
6952	We are aligning the facilities where veterans now live.	Yes
19861	And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.	Yes
26019	After the end of this year, we will resolve it as we did with social security in 1983.	Yes
11479	But one thing I would like to say about diplomacy, Israel should feel absolutely sure of one thing.	No
7069	After all, I was governor of the border for a while.	No
22086	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	Yes
23243	It was the largest market correction -- one of the most important in history, which announced a recession.	Yes
2200	Benefits were not affected at all.	Yes
7997	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	No
13085	We will respect our commitments to maintain freedom and independence in West Berlin.	No
16097	I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	No
7858	The question is what we're going to do in the future.	No
33992	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who pay more federal income tax than a billionaire.	Yes
16619	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	Yes
4359	And we cannot do what Senator Obama wants to do.	No
13421	But anyone who suggests that this program would be to any number indicated by the Vice-President is by mistake.	No
25422	We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	No
4163	"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	No
14868	I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	Yes
25639	"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	No
2830	You are not negotiating with Mr. Brezhnev for weakness.	No
30109	They were choking on the sanctions.	No
24310	And believe me, there are a lot of old boys in KGB.	No
25523	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	Yes
12090	And that's what needs to happen.	No
21808	We have 35 million people without any insurance, and I see them all the time.	Yes
18313	General Shinsheki, the Army Chief of Staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand soldiers.	Yes
32638	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	No
33195	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	Yes
29891	She didn't get the birth certificate.	Yes
25539	"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	No
2841	I don't see the photo as dark as you mentioned in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	No
8349	I'm not saying I made the decisions.	No
6926	The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	Yes
1205	I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	Yes
14720	It will not take miracles and it will not happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	No
2792	Well, I think this republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	No
10249	We have to be competitive if we want to create more jobs here.	No
16823	Mr Ford has - since he has been working on more than $5 billion in cuts for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very rich people who earn their income - not from work - but from investments.	Yes
2580	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	No
29440	Instead, they leave our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back to our country, because of the bureaucracy, because they can't get together.	Yes
17617	[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	Yes
15500	And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	No
7189	I am not going to appoint a judge to the Court who will overturn a constitutional right, whether it is the first amendment, or the fifth amendment, or another right that is given by our courts today -- under the Constitution.	No
12123	"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."	Yes
17279	I have a deep religious faith.	No
22032	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	Yes
10851	Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	No
12965	Why didn't we bring students here?	No
722	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	No
12601	Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	No
10619	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	Yes
25369	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	No
19277	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	No
26730	It's God's will, it'll happen.	No
2593	The evidence is that 50 per cent of college graduates this year cannot find a job.	Yes
1547	We have emerged from the recession and are again on the path to real prosperity in this country.	No
19137	For me, that's the key.	No
1589	Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	No
22936	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	No
7760	But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	No
22649	I always believed he was a threat.	No
11360	That's America.	No
2067	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	No
8138	He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	Yes
20170	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	No
723	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	No
22644	He's trying to attack me.	No
25638	Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	No
11220	I said before, watch Ukraine.	No
21417	And what happened in the meantime?	No
24643	But let me say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	No
10986	But it's certainly my responsibility.	No
29582	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	No
24502	But where we don't, it's with the confirmed drug addicts.	No
5499	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continuing decline in property and put the land under it, and so that people not only have the hope and belief that they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that this value will rise.	No
28782	That's what Washington needs.	No
1213	For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	Yes
12928	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Committee on External Relations, I am very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	Yes
22752	Of course, we'll find Osama bin Laden.	No
10724	"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	No
2819	Governor Carter indicated in November 1975 that he wanted to cut the defence budget by $15 billion.	Yes
19312	I thought that was wrong.	No
1518	We're not at war.	No
7582	As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	No
8570	First of all, I think it is good to put into perspective what we are actually doing with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole question of growth.	No
12803	I hope that it will not be necessary for any power to resume testing in the atmosphere.	No
16352	And I agree that integrity is not a republican or democratic issue; it is an American issue.	No
11815	Imagine what it is to be unjustly, unjustly, and to feel the unjust force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	No
9741	In a way, he went to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	No
20084	And you guys over there are gonna have to choose who you think is right.	No
28488	Last week, I broke up - I suspended the campaign for two days, or a two-day period, to return and participate in the meetings that set out the President's summit that he had just returned earlier today.	No
19045	We will continue to stay on the offense.	No
19660	If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	Yes
16311	It's the closest I've ever heard the governor of Massachusetts come to support everything that has to do with nuclear power, it's about as close as I've ever heard.Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made safer.	No
26807	But I'd just say that.	No
8700	put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.	No
8140	He's about four times more likely than the white baby to work in his life.	Yes
206	My State has just become the only state in the nation to provide universal health care and we have done so with the support of the business and labour world and the health care community and with almost everyone in the state.	Yes
19501	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	No
1058	If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.	No
20615	I think that the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked constructively with the Russians in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	No
26807	But I would just say this.	No
30417	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	No
21042	Now, the fact is that you're going to have a hard time convincing people that we were much better eight years ago than we are today.	No
23641	My opponent was against that.	Yes
15307	These approaches are very dangerous to the safety, well-being and peace of mind of pensioners in this country and those approaching retirement age.	No
9248	That is why we have doubled the energy efficiency standards on cars.	Yes
8279	Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.	No
26612	This is likely to happen in 2012 or 2015.	No
22303	It ought to be tried.	No
12654	I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	No
1569	A lot remains to be done.	No
12565	We must have a great goal.	No
26065	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	No
32377	And it shouldn't be allowed to arrive.	No
33951	And I would be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald.	Yes
6326	Now, as far as No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a big start in my opinion.	No
25481	Let's take your warhead principle.	No
20583	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	No
5551	Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	Yes
15438	There is a partnership involved in our nation.	No
23328	He voted 98 times to raise taxes.	Yes
29828	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	No
33162	The Supreme Court: That's what this is about.	No
33247	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	No
1028	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	No
5986	It's mortifying the future of our children.	No
22301	So I think it's worth a shot.	No
18511	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	No
34229	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	No
24240	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	No
27796	I mean that's how our free market works.	No
25979	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	Yes
28040	He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	No
719	Two questions: How to deter the nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets modernize and how do you spend a penny on something you consider a fantasy and fraud?	No
5793	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what is most pressing for them: the economic crisis.	No
2112	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	No
15285	There is now more oil in the wells that have been drilled than in 121 years that they have been drilled.	Yes
16449	There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	No
26057	You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	No
25837	We need to help people who are between jobs.	No
19520	We just had the election there.	No
20104	I said that we would put up, pass a criminal bill that would put 100,000 police officers on the street, ban assault weapons and deal with issues that should be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug traffickers, and we have done so.	Yes
2618	With respect to community colleges, we are witnessing excellent work across the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that currently exist.	No
161	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	Yes
26128	So the net tax increase in his plan is between $60 billion and $80 billion.	Yes
2627	When it comes to making the university affordable, whether it be two or four years, one of the things I did as president was that we sent $60 billion to banks and lenders as intermediaries for the student loan program, even if the loans were guaranteed.	Yes
7048	Of course, there's more work to do.	No
20161	It's important, it's their future.	No
6622	They were content to shake too many children through the system, year after year, year after year, year after year, without learning the basics.	No
21326	And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	Yes
2862	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	No
29822	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	No
11012	Everyone goes to Delaware, because they have pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	Yes
3960	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
25284	I object to the part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that I think is very unfair and that would prove to be the same.	No
12069	And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	No
18655	That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	Yes
11825	But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	No
17779	And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	No
9044	We spoke a multitude of tongues.	No
7274	Apparently, you can't take any tests under his worldview.	No
25142	I could've gone on forever.	No
23628	And I truly respect it.	No
12171	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	Yes
8032	I remember the period before the Korean War, South Korea was also supposed to be indefensible.	No
33705	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	Yes
3059	There should be a clear and unequivocal commitment to Israel.	No
10092	This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.	No
8535	We respect the standards of conduct they would never respect.	No
10335	During this, I think the President's campaign tried to characterize me as -- like someone who is very different from who I am.	No
29313	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want...	Yes
1936	Number two is to cut spending.	No
21225	There is a huge difference of opinion.	No
25226	We have an arms race underway instead.	No
17798	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	Yes
17124	And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	No
13516	Mr. Dulles suggested it's two to three times bigger than ours.	Yes
25094	We are a government on the part of the people, and when we evolve, it should be for very serious and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up having a stronger country behind us.	No
29898	Because I want to go to ISIS's defeat, because I want to go to job creation, because I want to go to a strong border, because I want to go to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	No
12834	But let's look at the other side of the room.	No
10936	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	No
13820	For the past three months -- neighborhoods where I've been fighting, 3 neighborhoods where I've been fighting for Congress to pass incentives for small businesses.	Yes
13239	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America are going to either look up, or look down.	No
16378	We can do better than that.	No
2839	I don't think we should move on to a cold war relationship.	No
1505	I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	No
128	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	No
27679	And it's important to them.	No
16348	So let's not throw stones at this.	No
7766	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	No
24613	It was a wonderful moment and I think she will do a first-class job on this commission.	No
1085	Now, after all these investigations by objective and responsible people, I think the question is closed once and for all.	No
12171	There was only one governor elected for a four-year term, and it was me.	Yes
19113	Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.	No
28363	She's a big spender.	No
895	But now we have the lines drawn too carefully here.	No
15248	We have the sources here.	No
25204	Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	No
17600	I don't expect these things to happen, so I say with great confidence that I'm not going to go for a tax.	No
12560	Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.	No
16599	That has to be changed.	No
2700	That is how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that is how we will end the war in Afghanistan.	No
17209	I don't want to hear them.	No
112	Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	No
13944	Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	No
3887	And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	No
29743	They would have won an appeal.	No
4107	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	No
16291	Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	No
15392	I would have someone on the herd about these regulations, and we would begin to eliminate these discriminations in the federal government against women.	No
817	A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.	Yes
2747	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	No
23728	I didn't want to give Halliburton any money.	No
8159	And I think that depends to a great extent on what we are doing here in this country.	No
7809	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	No
5765	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty hard.	No
24954	How can this happen in an administration and have a president of the United States in a situation like this one saying he didn't know?	No
22888	An all-volunteer army is the best suited to combat the new wars of the 21st century, which must be specialized and find these people as they hide around the world.	No
1358	A person who wishes to use a firearm for illegal purposes may obtain it, whether it is registered or prohibited.	No
19297	I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	No
4332	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	No
25815	"I heard you say on TV, ""The media made me do it."""	No
15450	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	No
3927	And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	No
3185	The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	No
22419	I do not want to raise taxes.	No
21885	And at that time, they'll be like apples falling from a tree.	No
32847	So I have a deep devotion, to use your word quite correct, to make sure an American feels like he has a place in our country.	No
335	I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	No
32568	She made bad judgments about Libya, about Syria, about Iraq.	No
25	We need to change this whole culture.	No
2898	Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	No
15533	And he could do the job.	No
17142	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	No
7951	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	No
9041	Now, with regard to my final remarks: I have always believed that this earth was placed here between the two great oceans by a divine plan.	No
27947	Thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and Lynn University.	No
29512	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	Yes
21856	You shouldn't worry if you get a new job to know if it's okay -- and part of our plan is to do what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you work for Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	No
12531	First of all, they made a fatal mistake in misjudged communists; trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	No
8350	And I would say that no president should ever allow anyone else to make the major decisions, the president only makes the decisions.	No
27716	And they don't have the same capabilities to attack the American homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	Yes
2400	And he also says you're going to have to get discounts if insurance companies spend more on administrative costs and benefits than on actual care.	Yes
23222	With regard to the deficit, the President received a surplus of $5.6 trillion, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
29303	The largest, a multinational known as CAFTA, I voted against.	Yes
15431	And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	No
10716	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be reduced in America.	No
23085	That's what leadership is.	No
18737	We have worked closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have conveyed the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programmes.	Yes
33313	It means their work is harder.	No
22435	If they want to keep dancing slowly and talk about it without doing it, I'm not your man.	No
30399	....women do not deserve equal pay unless they do a job as good as men.	No
1034	I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	No
19365	But I want to go back to 1965.	No
19010	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	Yes
33877	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	No
11224	We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	No
16098	I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.	No
14430	And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	Yes
4068	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	No
11294	I believe, by joining our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively reduce their behaviour, and hope that they will abandon this quest for nuclear weapons.	No
25145	-- me, or your own eyes?''	No
1071	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	No
20614	I think that's the wrong thing.	No
25295	And one of those dreams is justice.	No
23315	We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	Yes
19981	This is about getting the economy moving again.	No
15042	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	Yes
25530	National security and human rights must go hand in hand.	No
99	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	No
32594	Hundreds of thousands of children now have a chance to be adopted because I have worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	Yes
21120	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	No
8727	I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	No
390	Builders and community leaders are ready.	No
27179	Our military is second to none in the world.	Yes
31843	I have a very positive and optimistic view of what we can do together.	No
1398	I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	No
19683	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	Yes
26049	Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	Yes
20662	If you give me the presidency, I will do everything necessary to keep our forces strong in the world.	No
16624	In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	Yes
33028	But we need much more than wind and solar.	No
23104	You can pull it off of the Internet.	No
22472	I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.	No
3643	It's not a good deal for the American people.	No
25600	Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	Yes
8846	me that the Federal grants that come with.	No
33661	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	Yes
13136	We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.	Yes
825	We won't make such mistakes.	No
25872	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	No
15458	All this can be cured and everything can be solved.	No
14739	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	No
4213	I don't think we're going back to the cold war.	No
13660	He vetoed middle-class tax relief this year.	Yes
29282	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	Yes
4346	And this is the greatest country on Earth.	No
14703	They have come a long way towards the resumption of this election for the American people and the resumption of their country.	No
11686	In the years following World War I and World War II, our military leaders and the people of the United States have learned a great lesson.	No
493	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	No
9053	That we must cut back.	No
6693	If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	Yes
1782	And that's exactly what I did.	Yes
21651	The president can't command Congress.	No
26821	I want voters to make a decision.	No
10624	And I see why you feel this cynicism and distrust, because the Washington system is broken.	No
18269	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	No
19777	That is why, when I became President, I was determined to go beyond all the unfinished debate that had taken place in Washington for too long to move this country forward.	No
28371	And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	No
17788	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	Yes
29488	Broad and inclusive growth is what we need in America, no more benefits for the people at the top.	No
26938	Well, my strategy is pretty simple, which is to go after the bad guys, make sure we do our best to interrupt them, to -- kill them, to get them out of the picture.	No
28742	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	No
16945	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	No
26373	He still believes it's a mistake.	No
8749	According to a study published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - we have indicated that in the commercial sector of the economy alone, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy we consume today in this country.	Yes
18705	"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."	No
7606	Instead, our help went on to Batista, which was ineffective; we were never on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and Cuba is now lost to freedom.	No
32167	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	No
3950	Thirdly, we must deal with Pakistan, because Al-Qaida and the Taliban have shelters in Pakistan, on the other side of the border in the north-western regions, and although under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we have given them $10 billion over the past seven years, they have not done what it takes to get rid of these shelters.	Yes
26209	You have a $265 billion tax increase.	Yes
12547	That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	No
627	I want to be the president who gets the balance of conventional forces.	No
29898	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	No
21311	Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.	Yes
3021	In these circumstances, I believe that they would refrain from pushing us on our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
16506	In fact, since the late 1960s, when Mr. Nixon took office, we have reduced the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30% to about 20%.	Yes
8499	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	No
18003	I showed the Americans I know how to run.	No
24096	That's why I don't think we should do it that fast.	No
14394	We have issued written instructions to Ambassador Glaspie.	Yes
16772	Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.	No
20342	Let me give you a quick example.	No
10576	My friend, I would like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote to warn you of this crisis.	No
8874	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water pipes in this city had started to run away, and literally there was no money available to fix them.	Yes
26678	And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	No
8508	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get a Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the House - not a Republican - and they joined the Democrats who had opposed it.	Yes
1170	And we acquired, uh, a consciousness among the voters in this country, especially those in which I entered - thirty of them, no one ever did that - about who I was and what I was defending.	No
10315	That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	No
25126	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	Yes
23148	That's why I told you about the prize he won from the National Journal.	No
19898	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	No
11647	But I think with hindsight, we were too late to get in there.	No
3882	They just passed an election...	No
605	I can tell him I'm against it.	No
16394	And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	No
16479	In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	Yes
5499	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	No
29827	Five hundred murders are a lot of murders.	No
7436	And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	No
28296	It is ironic that there is now -- there is now a lower percentage of voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we have the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	Yes
3207	So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	No
8026	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	No
17120	But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.	Yes
368	We must have a president who can lead on this issue, who can work with Congress, and I am ready to do so.	No
3982	And I know how to work with them.	No
17644	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	Yes
6838	Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	Yes
3556	I will make them famous.	No
28000	I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.	No
16894	There's some question about their morality.	No
5908	It is not only that he has some of the best foreign policy references of anyone.	No
33486	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	Yes
16202	I'm against the grain embargo, it was a mistake.	No
19669	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill I signed will allow 25 million people to retain their health insurance when they change jobs or when someone in their family is sick.	Yes
32650	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	No
22263	Sooner or later, you get 11 other boys who can run like the devil weighing 250 pounds and they could win district.	No
266	"Then he said, ""I'm a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	No
20913	Let me give you another example.	No
9941	Instead, let people make their own choices.	No
33095	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	No
21970	Every year, Congress and the President sign laws that make us do more and give us less money to do it.	Yes
18962	And it is important that we have a good relationship, because it allows me to better comment on and discuss with him some of the decisions he makes.	No
23272	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	No
30461	I'm going to be able to do it.	No
896	But you're talking about judgment.	No
12443	This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.	No
17568	They hit the middle- and middle-income Americans and left the rich Americans largely intact.	Yes
21408	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	No
25055	This is a very important objective, which is to ensure that we continue to hope for greater independence on the part of these nations and to work with each of them separately.	No
11292	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	No
8202	We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	Yes
300	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	No
22497	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	No
16157	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	Yes
13325	He took the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even prefer compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons that the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	Yes
9485	We have created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
22372	A message just won't do it.	No
12768	I really don't need Mr Nixon to tell me what my responsibilities as a citizen are.	No
32896	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	No
8383	#NAME?	No
21579	I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	No
19315	I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	No
15852	But he's in the arena.	No
21023	I want new incentives for savings and investment for young couples working hard so that they can save and invest alone in addition to social security, not at the expense of social security, as the governor proposes.	No
6760	You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.	No
23882	I hate to run for president and think that the only way to win would be to convince everyone how horrible things are.	No
11772	This is a huge problem and corruption in official agencies, such as the armed forces and police services all over the world, customs officials, is one of the worst forms of this.	No
26222	I object that someone prefers something for which he is not qualified.	No
25897	We were never asked to send troops to the West Bank.	Yes
2733	I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.	No
2247	Can we stay on Medicare?	No
1602	But I believe that together we can make great progress.	No
31842	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	No
8586	The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.	No
27266	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	Yes
16783	As a result, we saved over $9 billion in federal spending.	Yes
2277	As a businessman, I must have had -- I need to know the rules.	No
26754	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and work hard and do what you are supposed to do, you have the right to equal treatment.	No
8219	But on the other hand, when we look at the different programs it offers, they don't seem to be new.	No
14569	And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	Yes
8191	Well, we have a comparison we can make.	No
14220	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and that's the best case we can solve at the time.	No
24812	They fought and won World War II.	No
2903	That is how we can restore the strength of our country, and they do not need long experience in foreign policy.	No
21899	And you have to vote for someone with a plan.	No
25390	What's wrong with Star Wars?	No
26682	There are American jobs that are lost.	No
27396	In my opinion, it makes our future less secure and less secure.	No
28665	I don't think it's fair to impose people's assets twice, regardless of your status.	No
19956	Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	No
8602	I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.	No
19260	My balanced budget plan takes ten years on health insurance.	Yes
16676	He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.	Yes
13224	Well, I have to say that, uh - Mr. Truman has, uh - his methods of expressing things; he has been in politics for fifty years; he is President of the United States.	No
7028	I heard more of the same.	No
19128	And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	No
27143	The idea that we would have tanks on those young people who were in Tahrir Square is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	No
28332	I therefore believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for the local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic tests, a program that works, the phone works, moreover, it must be part of our program.	No
1605	We've been drifting for too long.	No
15832	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	No
1367	I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	No
442	I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.	No
19540	I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.	No
8076	That's what I believe deeply.	No
18326	"To save Halliburton the spoil of war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Department of Defense saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother asking for any construction."""	Yes
19410	We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	Yes
26537	We'd be in trouble all over America.	No
26035	I told them in early 1995.	No
32503	I'm sorry I have to keep saying that, but he lives in another reality.	No
23058	"The president said, ""I'm not blocking this."""	No
28114	So what I want to do is call Republicans and Democrats to forget the whole debate and finger pointed, and get together and take care of our prescription drug program for seniors, which says we're going to pay for poor seniors, we're going to help all seniors with prescription drugs.	No
6808	What I'm saying is that, as we promote life and a culture of life, there are certainly ways to work together to reduce the number of abortions: to continue to promote adoption laws -- that's an excellent alternative to abortion -- to continue to fund and promote maternity homes; and to continue to promote abstinence programs.	No
23417	I think you should take the break.	No
22554	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	Yes
17002	We have lost the vision of what our country can and should be.	No
29500	And we have a Fed who does political things.	No
19518	Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.	Yes
23292	He proposed $2.2 trillion in new expenditures.	Yes
24197	Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.	No
33711	The report was so bad.	No
14341	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull out all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said throughout the fall and what you have, then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said in the end when they were trying to clean up.	No
28201	We need to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	No
26103	And the government doesn't create jobs.	No
34387	No, it's going to totally help you.	No
18835	My concerns about the honourable senator are that, during this campaign, I listened very carefully to what he is saying and that he is changing his position on the war in Iraq.	Yes
24102	I disagree with Mr. Perot.	No
7694	Thirdly, I do not believe that the division of government contracts is being vigorously exploited.	No
15066	Barbara, one of the scourges of this world is the threat and activities of terrorists.	No
12726	I think the judgment could be rendered after the election, if I succeeded.	No
24193	Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.	No
23908	When I make a mistake, I'll admit it.	No
18426	I never used the hardest word, like you did at the time.	No
10954	Co-payments are increasing, costs are increasing, costs are rising sharply, making people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	Yes
17489	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	No
8979	And a newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no doubt that Governor Reagan had prevented the state of California from going bankrupt.	Yes
29574	But I think the question is, if he were to approach the White House, what would these conflicts be?	No
24931	And he drew up this manual.	No
22220	I don't think we should spend money on private schools.	No
12673	And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.	No
17745	I'll give the president some credit.	No
17182	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	Yes
14739	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	No
27085	We must make a very effective leadership effort in Syria, ensuring that the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents who become armed are persons who will be the responsible parties.	No
7006	We heard the same thing.	No
31995	But what President Clinton did, he was indicted, he lost his license to practice law.	Yes
23715	There is no greater judgment for a president of the United States than the way you lead a nation to war.	No
27124	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	No
17807	We have just concluded almost the whole debate.	No
3005	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	No
20546	It was strong men and women who made good judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	No
23308	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	No
12391	I found this to be a problem in trying to defend my tax relief system.	No
512	That's the way you help people.	No
21543	That's not specific in terms of a program.	No
24313	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	No
6563	We're not giving this away for nothing.	No
8445	I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	No
15126	And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	No
12801	I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	No
19667	And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.	No
11708	That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.	Yes
7465	When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.	No
22887	It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	Yes
30390	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	No
6717	That's not what we want.	No
3132	These grey zone weapons systems pose some problems in an agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	Yes
23981	I questioned his judgment and his character.	No
23246	After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	Yes
24373	They are making some progress, not enough for us.	No
14850	There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	No
23070	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	Yes
25903	I think what Mr Arafat wants us to do is ensure that everyone respects the agreements they have already concluded.	No
1387	Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	Yes
32031	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	No
25363	But no one knows if Armageddon, these prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years or the day after.	No
23863	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	Yes
16543	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	Yes
13693	He says Arkansas is a bad condition.	Yes
636	We've accumulated more than a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States will have to make a few choices.	Yes
12703	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	No
14839	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	No
6800	I think a hospital company is a society where every person counts and every person counts.	No
29150	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	Yes
19442	And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
534	It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	No
7153	I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	No
6140	I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	No
12895	If we want to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America do not want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two major powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	No
10801	And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	Yes
17490	Do we really want these decisions to be made by judges who have been chosen because they will agree to find the person guilty?	No
19599	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	No
7724	Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.	No
19275	First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	Yes
11038	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	No
29732	And we have to be very strong.	No
17290	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	No
10775	And let's create jobs and return to our economy.	No
22254	There is nothing -- the most effective unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	No
7296	I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.	No
19670	I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	Yes
33634	During his regime, during President Obama's regime, we doubled our national debt.	Yes
25297	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends in the south.	No
6597	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	Yes
13262	For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	No
24904	This raises the whole question of what the presidential leadership is.	No
1004	Mr Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under the administration of Ford, will be called upon to make the necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace that we have.	No
8464	It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.	Yes
26911	We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.	Yes
24846	And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	Yes
6731	I know that we have a choice to make in America, that is, to treat people with tolerance, respect and dignity.	No
27363	We need to be thinking about cyber security.	No
11994	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	No
17359	The American people want their children educated.	No
22112	Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	Yes
13397	This will cost more money, and growth will help us win this battle.	No
3058	And this has considerably weakened our relations with Israel and clouded our people's total commitment to the Israelis.	No
3903	We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.	No
7218	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	Yes
434	The question is who makes the decision.	No
25428	Now, if you are ready to join us to get rid of all nuclear weapons in the world, then we will give you this one, so that we both know that no one can cheat; that we both have something only if someone tries to cheat.	No
22210	No one can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	No
8965	But on his very optimistic figures on his balanced budget tax reduction by 1983, and the fact that he uses, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that the report of the Senate Budget Committee does not take into account all Reagan's defence plans.	Yes
22611	After September 11, we had to acknowledge that when we saw a threat, we had to take it seriously before it came to harm us.	No
7990	Well, Mr.Nixon, I will give you the testimony of Mr.George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, a minority member of the ranks - a Republican member - and a former chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture who testified in 1959 - said that there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to provide a decent diet.	Yes
23900	I think character is a very important question.	No
29196	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	No
12981	And I believe that it is up to us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do so, we must give this country leadership and we must move America forward.	No
1009	I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	No
29847	Murder is too much.	No
25881	We're at 336 ships.	Yes
8995	For a return to the traditions and values we once had.	No
918	I oppose supply management and production controls.	No
20334	If I could answer that.	No
882	And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	No
28697	And so I don't support censorship.	No
9606	Earlier, Governor Romney spoke of his willingness to make Pell grants and other studies available to youth.	Yes
12543	It encourages them to begin a war.	No
10350	I also managed to rank our schools first in the country, so 100 per cent of our children would have a great opportunity for a future.	Yes
14398	Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.	No
8221	And I would say that during the evening, he could indicate the areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	No
15529	And I don't think age is the only criterion.	No
14479	I say that to both political parties.	No
18848	I only think if you do that -- and he did it more than I did with regard to the presidency -- can you begin to understand what that means to your families.	No
13736	I think it's been pretty impressive.	No
24452	I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	Yes
17915	The President's record is quite different.	No
23407	If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	No
13444	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	No
32926	I'm shocked to hear that.	No
30371	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	No
1397	What would be - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	No
17508	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on it?	No
20223	I'm from west Texas.	No
12196	And secondly, I repeat to you --	No
23853	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	Yes
3556	I'll make them famous.	No
9717	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	No
25260	And, in fact, we have not avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	Yes
28651	And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	No
11476	It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	No
6394	You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	No
12655	He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.	No
17017	On the second of November, you will all make a very, very important decision.	No
715	That's-at least that's what I read.	No
24313	For America to remain the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	No
7798	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	No
14940	The President's economic plan calls for higher taxes to the point that we are finally taking so much money from the citizens that we can balance the budget in this way.	Yes
1789	And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	Yes
6507	We're hunting after Osama bin Laden.	No
12566	And that is not only to keep freedom for ourselves, but to extend it to everyone, to extend it to everyone, because it is America's destiny.	No
604	I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	No
20805	We can surely send you back 5% who pay the bills.	No
12074	She works there longer than I do.	No
15649	And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	No
3971	And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.	No
25420	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	No
29240	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	Yes
20758	It is not the role of a president to decide good and evil.	No
6793	That's why I'm fighting to clean up the environment and protect this land.	No
28459	I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	No
30419	Some people said -- someone who was very vicious for me, Rosie O'Donnell, I told her very difficult things, and I think everyone would agree that she deserves it and that no one would feel sorry for her.	No
139	Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	Yes
29790	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	No
11066	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	No
3897	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	Yes
7068	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	No
25909	He puts his money in the years to come, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything happened, and nothing's gonna happen.	No
590	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	Yes
29207	It's very important to me.	No
8698	In other words, we have seen a huge increase of about $50 per gallon since then, and all this increase has come out of this country - or a large part of it - in the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	Yes
24439	I urged the President to support this air cover, and he did - and I applaud him.	Yes
7465	When I met her in Joe's garden and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic garden barbecue.	No
16202	I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	No
21999	Well, Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	No
15928	And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	No
10611	I'm going to spend a little money on the key issues we need to work on.	No
32779	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	No
29214	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	No
17608	"Mr. President, you said, ""This is it?"	No
7961	You can't add billions of dollars to our spending and not pay them.	No
3510	I think Senator McCain is quite right to need more responsibility, but we don't just need it in the event of a crisis.	No
19418	I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	No
21747	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	No
5579	... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	No
22092	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	No
29694	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	No
12395	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	Yes
6614	Here's some help getting you to go to a community college.	No
28700	I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	No
22590	He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	Yes
30243	That's a good thing.	No
27799	If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	No
9934	I'm glad you thought I was a standard carrier four years ago, but I wasn't.	No
34457	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	No
27539	We are four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
443	But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	No
1369	I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	No
16865	The minutes show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	Yes
25526	What is happening in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel laureate, two days ago, said that the administration was perceived as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	Yes
1514	We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	Yes
9824	It is growing more slowly this year than last year, and slower last year than the previous year.	Yes
2530	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	No
15603	He's raised taxes several times.	Yes
26503	And I think that right now we have to go back.	No
22558	I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	No
19045	We will continue to attack the offence.	No
21174	They should take this into account when going to the voting booth.	No
32089	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	No
15364	I believe that the federal government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that come back at the state and local levels.	No
8153	And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	No
5970	"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	Yes
23229	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	No
33464	Now we can talk about Putin.	No
17315	With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.	No
27250	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	No
1171	Now we have a very, very large group of advisers who help me prepare these debates and teach me about the international economy, foreign affairs, defence issues, health, education, well-being, government reorganization.	No
25806	It's a good start.	No
24930	We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.	Yes
25711	We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	Yes
12699	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	No
17379	But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	No
12109	Second -- and they're good.	No
17903	And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	No
19467	They awarded about $200 million, but they spent only $3 million to start it.	Yes
6084	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care you want.	No
15312	Well, that just isn't true.	No
545	We put more money per child in education, and we don't do what we should.	Yes
11776	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	No
30294	Nobody's ever seen that before.	No
24619	"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	No
13608	Do I have 1 minute?	No
8720	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	No
33669	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	Yes
28848	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	No
17593	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	Yes
33057	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	Yes
10792	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	No
8999	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	Yes
22235	Yes, I have scars to show to be around education reform.	No
6736	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	No
8142	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	No
2241	One last point I want to make.	No
1016	No, Mr. Kraft, we are spending very much today, about $200 billion a year, almost 50% of our total federal spending on human needs by the federal government today.	Yes
15563	I heard about an empty check.	No
21463	But character is an important part of the equation.	No
22156	And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	No
28381	It's just the right position to take.	No
440	No other state programs do that.	Yes
29354	But you have no plan.	No
12221	And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	No
12549	They need to know, in other words, that it is a national suicide if they start something.	No
25744	First of all, I would say that this is a very good question.	No
2596	It's time for a new path.	No
10864	And -- and I know we can reprocess spent nuclear fuel.	No
26035	I told them in early '95.	No
6741	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state parliaments must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	No
28691	I know it's not directly about Hollywood, but it reinforces the values you teach.	No
1473	He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.	Yes
14678	They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.	No
20694	We must be ready to make good judgments.	No
7072	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you'll come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	No
27888	Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.	No
15692	But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.	No
26040	We need to reform it.	No
10945	He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	No
33860	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	No
29852	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	No
18451	We need to deny them the safe havens.	No
2490	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	Yes
26418	We've earned jobs in manufacturing since I was president.	Yes
7661	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	No
5660	I am opposed to ethanol subsidies because I thought they were distorting the market and creating inflation; Senator Obama supported these subsidies.	Yes
12446	I think we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers as well.	No
15193	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	No
15021	We now intend to continue the revitalization programme with increased commitments in the areas of rapid transit and public transit.	No
20008	Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	Yes
2199	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	Yes
14398	Ambassador Glaspie spoke a lot after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in every newspaper.	No
10975	All the parents I know would get health insurance for their children if they could.	No
14893	At the beginning of the year, in the first quarter, we experienced a very high inflationary pressure caused by the increase in OPEC prices.	Yes
25625	He was to enter a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when this time capsule was opened.	No
12414	That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	Yes
25979	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you're going back to Mexico.	Yes
23001	This war is long and long, and it requires a firm determination, and it requires a full understanding that not only are we pursuing Al-Qaida, but we are disrupting terrorist shelters as well as those who could provide support to terrorists.	No
20066	I know everything about poverty and everything about need and everything about caring for people, and that was my career in the United States Senate.	No
22493	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	No
15191	It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	No
3432	So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.	No
16802	He didn't save $9 billion with his vetoes.	Yes
2167	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	Yes
32259	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	No
2195	And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	No
16194	I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	No
8893	I stood there, and I met the people.	No
13669	Middle-class Americans work harder for less money than they did ten years ago and pay higher taxes.	Yes
24995	And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	Yes
27492	There is an agreement to have, that is, they respect the rules that have already been established.	No
20775	Under Vice-President Gore's plan, they get $145 in tax relief.	Yes
19891	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	No
114	This is very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to allow these amounts not to be collected.	No
11992	If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.	No
26510	And we ended up having more votes than he had, and then they decided to pull the plug.	Yes
13878	This would break the automotive industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	No
29657	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	No
3565	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	Yes
13449	They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.	Yes
4380	So this is a national security issue.	No
19412	We supported a crime bill that included 60 death sentences, including the death penalty for drug traffickers.	Yes
21455	I think you have to look at it.	No
28933	I don't think that's true.	No
29110	This begins with an increase in the national minimum wage and, finally, with the guarantee of equal pay for women's work.	No
16907	I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.	No
18138	And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	No
32841	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
1532	I did not always agree with their decisions, whether they are democratic or republican presidents.	No
15684	The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	No
18774	Second, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to impose sanctions on Iran -- we already sanctioned Iran.	Yes
33651	We're going to cut corporate taxes massively.	No
14046	And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	No
17208	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I began to do so, and I continue to do so in this office -- that any question that comes to mind, I instructed Cabinet and staff not to raise the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	No
2324	We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	No
16994	For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.	No
22457	And I beg the American people, whenever they think of reforming education to take this piece of society that is not lucky and take these small pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nourish and the affection and support you give to your children and teach them that they are unique and precious and that there is only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation flourish.	No
3687	Just -- a report just came out that the average franchise has increased by 30% on American families.	Yes
22623	But as we learned in the same report I mentioned, Saddam Hussein was playing the oil-for-food programme to get rid of sanctions.	Yes
11478	And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	No
25986	I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	No
5768	One of them happened the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I wrote about him -- MP John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter of American history, segregation, the death of children in the church bombings, George Wallace.	Yes
21978	That's because we didn't grow up.	No
10335	In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	No
10084	I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	Yes
19531	They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.	Yes
2006	It's now four years later.	No
33045	We have to guard our energy companies.	No
9048	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	No
7421	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or from this side.	No
18796	They must have the logistical ability to go there and stop the murder.	No
13966	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	Yes
10092	This -- administration -- the administration indicated that it was a reaction to a video and a spontaneous reaction.	No
794	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	No
18465	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	No
17220	We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.	No
7872	Because we fundamentally disagree with the position of the United States, and if its view prevails, I believe that this will bring an important result to this country in the 1960s.	No
9257	But we must also continue to understand how we have energy efficiency, because that is ultimately how we will reduce demand and that is what will keep gas prices down.	No
14247	I think it's the very essence of management, rather than cutting markets in dark rooms in Washington.	No
24085	We have to collect taxes to do so.	No
24033	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	No
34241	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	No
22589	And it sends a confusing signal to people.	No
32158	But that in itself was a good thing.	No
10872	And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.	No
11510	It must be a timetable that all parties can accept, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	No
17019	A president should never promise more than he can do and a president should always deliver everything he has promised.	No
7036	If you're married, you got tax relief.	Yes
19395	They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	No
785	Is Iran talking about peace in Iraq?	No
25162	First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.	Yes
15021	We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.	No
23746	But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	No
17798	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people across the country, through the Grace Commission, that we are currently studying -- and we have already implemented 17 per cent -- that are recommendations on how to make government more efficient and cost-effective.	Yes
12106	First, we need more community health centres.	No
20646	And it starts by making sure we rebuild our military power.	No
26688	And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.	No
16568	I do not agree with that view.	No
19127	But more importantly, you're worried about the future and they'll have the same opportunities as you and I had.	No
676	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
23514	But you know what we as Americans must also do is never let terrorists change the United States Constitution in a way that puts our rights at a disadvantage.	No
18464	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	No
23990	I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	No
16405	I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	No
14247	I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	No
26645	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	No
23200	Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.	No
20377	If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	Yes
14895	In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	Yes
15673	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	No
33503	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	No
29	Everybody should be in this thing.	No
16345	And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	Yes
23771	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, which can lead, which can do things.	No
20109	I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.	Yes
6590	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	No
20419	It's an issue I know a lot about.	No
33549	And that's why 10 people who had this huge responsibility came out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with nuclear codes or have his finger on the nuclear button.	Yes
12250	Let me start with Texas.	No
2748	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	No
18699	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	Yes
17748	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	No
34276	I am well aware of the truly legitimate concerns that you have expressed both by the President and by the General.	No
13593	The richest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have increased.	Yes
12930	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	No
3288	And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and energetic steps we have taken, we would have been, uh - criticized very, very, very, uh - severely for taking a step backwards and not moving.	No
27955	I want to make sure we have the best education system in the world.	No
10658	I think you can work on all three at the same time, Tom.	No
9967	You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	No
27394	In my view, it is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States to maintain the security of the American people.	No
7961	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	No
34419	I have a plan for doing that.	No
6487	I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	No
15666	And I'm not the one who compared the president of the United States rotting from a dead fish from the head down.	No
29699	And we have to get the weapons out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.	No
5789	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate this evening on health care, energy policy and tax policy.	No
12726	I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.	No
2145	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	No
7862	Now, what's the problem is what we're going to do in the future.	No
27122	But it's been a year.	Yes
5674	And, in fact, a spending freeze across the country is an axe, and we need a scalpel, because there are programs that don't work at all.	No
3435	Number two, we have to make sure that taxpayers, when they put their money at risk, have the opportunity to recover that money and win, if the market -- and when the market comes back.	No
24287	We have to do things here.	No
34057	He lost the Iowa caucus.	Yes
27993	They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	No
13431	The democratic platform and others say five percent.	Yes
22822	The president did not do what was necessary.	No
17240	And so, we made a proposal.	No
19367	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	Yes
16460	I do not believe that Mr. Carter was more specific in this case than he was in many other cases.	No
23153	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	No
33227	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	No
28196	They talked about it in Washington, D.C.	No
26432	You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	No
29326	You were totally in favor of that.	Yes
25856	Someone, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe someone else.	No
17427	I thought it was pretty hard to do.	No
12452	And the way to do it is first to recruit more teachers.	No
2327	And, you know, I appreciate and it seems that we have some agreement that a market to work must have some sort of regulation.	No
33618	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	No
32241	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	No
32166	But we've got to get costs down.	No
16564	So, when you look at the penalty he paid, and when you analyze the demands I had - to spend all my time working on the economy, which was in difficulty, which I inherited; to work on our problems in South-East Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been rather penalized by his resignation in shame and necessity, and the need for me to focus on the country's problems fully justified the action that I took.	No
10499	Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America are living on eBay.	Yes
12735	Well, Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I've always answered all the questions about who the next cabinet will be, saying it's the next president's responsibility, and it would be inappropriate to make decisions about it or to announce any decisions before I have the right to do so.	No
21	And I do not believe at all that I believe that there are fundamental rights and wrongs as long as they are used.	No
14275	Sometimes he has to act.	No
13482	Today, America has a huge burden in this regard.	No
20053	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	No
9031	I think he is.	No
13732	I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	No
426	And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	Yes
7531	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	No
5656	I know how to eliminate programs.	No
6716	We have more people who qualify.	Yes
187	So the answer seems to me to be in the full implementation of the catastrophic programme.	No
7694	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	No
7948	I think it will be difficult, but I am convinced that this country can fulfil its responsibilities.	No
32239	Once we get out -- once we get out of the lines and allow the competition to come...	No
1666	But we all know that we still have a lot of work to do.	No
12811	We should make one last effort.	No
12983	Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.	No
11088	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to affect the situation favorably and realize that you are sending America's most valuable asset, American blood, into the way of harming.	No
4103	Look, I'm gonna sit with anyone, but there must be preconditions.	No
8390	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	No
948	I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	No
24154	Someone who thinks about it cares a lot.	No
17724	Everyone - every economist, every businessman - believes it.	No
34445	We have the greatest people on Earth in our army.	No
24687	And yet the caisse is empty and she had our money, taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	No
2994	I didn't wink at the food.	No
1892	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
16944	I would have uh - done it opposite.	No
6180	That's not how we should judge these candidates.	No
22080	Now, in particular, one, on health insurance, it's not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	No
22706	"You know, they even had the Department of Defense issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother asking for help or being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	No
32986	But the people who will respect the United States Constitution.	No
16303	Why have these security violations occurred?	No
7466	"O'Neill said, ""Come."	No
1566	But our country is innately very strong.	No
13714	We have the lowest per capita expenditure in the country.	Yes
32449	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	No
18125	And when Iraq is free, America will be safer.	No
28825	I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.	No
6856	The VA provides drugs at a lower cost to our veterans.	Yes
24188	Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.	No
27910	That will not help us compete with China.	Yes
3667	Again, you can look at it.	No
21201	I would support an effort to ban corporate money and union money provided there is a contribution check.	No
10985	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	No
16992	It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	No
21359	Because the deficit has been accumulating for 12 years.	Yes
27604	And when we do this kind of thing -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, who send a message to the world, and he tells Peyton (ph) that we have not forgotten his father.	No
25913	We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.	Yes
9935	Four years ago, you said you'd introduce a law.	Yes
19745	For me, that's not the strategy people expect from America.	No
16638	Let me now talk about what we did at the White House with respect to federal employees The first order I issued after my assumption of the presidency was to reduce or eliminate the potential increase of forty thousand federal employees planned by my predecessor.	Yes
17426	I haven't re-registered yet.	No
2045	We now spend 42 per cent of our economy on government.	Yes
18203	You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.	No
11227	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	No
11726	And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	No
11813	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	No
13940	No, I say that our main need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the basis for employment, and to create a dynamic and growing basis.	No
16823	Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.	Yes
13382	And I would also like to point out that Senator Kennedy has omitted part of the cost of this program - a twenty-five per cent increase in the price of food that people would have to pay.	Yes
15023	We also run housing programs.	No
11553	And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	No
17386	We did, 25 percent across the board.	Yes
13405	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	No
29887	And you can go get it, and you can check it out.	No
1711	First of all, we need to improve our education system and we have made tremendous progress by taking advantage of the ideas of the Democrats and Republicans who are already beginning to show gains in some of the most difficult to manage with schools.	Yes
3046	The net result is this administration, and during my term as President for the next four years, we will continue to move towards the normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be resolved peacefully, as agreed in the 1972 Shanghai communiqué.	No
32681	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	Yes
14676	And I am also focusing on the fact that it is not a paradox that we have the highest productivity of our workforce in the industrialized world and that at the same time we have the largest trade deficit, and that we are behind nine other nations in what we are paying our most productive people in the world, and we are losing entire industries abroad.	Yes
13400	That is why I call for a tax reform programme that will further stimulate investment in our economy.	No
25897	We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	Yes
27364	We need to talk about space.	No
22963	I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	No
19889	If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	No
25374	What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	No
18271	And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	No
1186	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	No
16149	And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	No
10735	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes drilling at sea.	No
20080	And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	No
13404	We must also ensure that the entire people of the United States — the great talents of our people — are properly used.	No
26455	In February, he said we have the best economy in 30 years, just in February.	Yes
27410	And so, when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how we will best meet all our defence needs in a way that also maintains faith with our troops, which also ensures that our veterans have the kind of support they need when they return home.	No
4091	We do need tougher sanctions.	No
138	That's one of the things I think makes a big difference between us.	No
26465	I am opposed to discrimination in any form, but I am not in favour of creating special rights for any group.	No
8722	The fact is that, in today's oil wells, there is even more oil than we have so far gone out and used.	Yes
5795	And I would like to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, talking about health care, talking about energy and understanding how Americans can send their children to university.	No
22884	We won't have a draft.	No
29344	So is it President Obama's fault?	No
32477	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	Yes
25760	They're trying to lead us.	No
15600	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	No
14768	And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	No
28962	Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?	No
21948	It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	No
3631	And if you earn less than $250,000, less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, then you won't see the value of a one-cent tax increase.	Yes
7602	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	Yes
25459	Why I don't agree with the MX, it's a duck sitting.	No
1283	Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.	No
7461	And she speaks much better English than I do.	No
25570	Why threaten our space satellites on which we depend?	No
19207	We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	Yes
19114	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	No
7934	I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	No
18132	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	No
1789	And he says he'll pay for it by closing the loopholes and deductions.	Yes
33644	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	Yes
33794	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every possible way, especially children and families, and stay ahead of you, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	No
11063	If we could have stopped Rwanda, certainly, if we had the capacity, that would be something we would have to consider and act firmly.	No
23298	Now, either he's going to break all those wonderful promises he's been telling you about, or he's going to raise the taxes.	No
34399	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	No
23199	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	Yes
15183	It is hardly a treaty and an opposition to the limitation of arms.	No
27315	That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	No
19092	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	No
24322	We must rebuild America's strength at home.	No
32469	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	Yes
907	Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.	No
15532	The American people see it, and I am proud of it; that is what I would say.	No
10300	That's what brings jobs.	No
19473	And maybe that's another thing we can depoliticize.	No
21877	He has to raise $20,000 a week to get enough money to run.	Yes
18019	Forty-one per cent of these 10 million are women.	Yes
1968	When I entered the oval office, I had more than a trillion dollars in deficit to greet me.	Yes
11552	I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	No
25872	So I'm going to do better, and we're going to do better, but it's a commitment that I think all Americans share regardless of the party.	No
16057	I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	Yes
10130	They're using cheap handguns.	Yes
13645	The only thing I've done is put it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	No
4133	He even said the other day that he wouldn't potentially meet the Prime Minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure they were aligned with us.	Yes
13722	It's a fairly rural state.	No
13644	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	No
2476	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	No
10620	The key is whether or not we have priorities that work for you, as opposed to those that have dictated politics in Washington lately, and they are mostly lobbyists and special interests.	Yes
5535	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	No
1605	We've been drifting too long.	No
17272	First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	No
6112	He says he's gonna give you a $5,000 tax credit.	Yes
1519	We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
1740	This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	No
27071	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	Yes
22463	In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.	No
23994	That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	No
18270	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	No
16621	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	No
15659	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	No
2190	The idea, which was originally presented by MP Ryan, your racing companion, is that we would give seniors a voucher and that they could go out to the private market and buy their own health insurance.	Yes
29204	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	No
6618	We talk about fiscal matters.	No
27382	Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	No
32690	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	Yes
27118	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	No
15976	But the Organ Working Group, the Bipartite Working Group, estimated that we could raise about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that.	Yes
12167	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	Yes
13192	That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	Yes
15945	And these two principles can now apply to conventional forces, strategic forces, provided that	No
26617	And we need to make it stronger.	No
16526	Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	No
22466	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	No
19857	But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	No
15734	I'm ready to do it, the vice president isn't.	No
7872	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	No
12961	And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	No
3010	It's a matter of being strong.	No
20916	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	Yes
33055	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	Yes
17756	Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position that he will magically disappear.	No
11225	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	No
11770	The governor mentioned it earlier.	No
16710	When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
25486	I don't trust the Russians.	No
15774	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	No
4361	And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	No
12938	The first position you took, when this issue was first raised, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defending these islands.	Yes
698	So I'm for continuous research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	No
32944	We are back on the right track.	No
21186	And incidentally, one of them is this.	No
29176	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	Yes
12209	I can't emphasize to you how much.	No
19238	But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.	No
18104	The killer - the brain of the September 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is in prison.	Yes
17289	That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	No
15304	As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.	No
3294	We have organized diplomatic demonstrations with the Cambodian Government through the United Nations.	Yes
26443	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	No
782	Are we doing better in the fight against terrorism?	No
33289	And, honestly, no one has any business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one, two, three or four days before birth.	No
8508	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	Yes
6717	That's not what we want.	No
9279	I believe a lot in our renewable capacities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	No
25014	I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.	No
11726	And when he's outstretched, morale drops.	No
2949	We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.	Yes
18744	I think we could have done better.	No
18059	I don't think the United States did that.	No
24749	I say that if Germany can cover everyone and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of its inhabitants at lower health care costs than others, if Rochester, New York, can do so with two thirds of the cost of the rest, America can do so too.	Yes
18564	"When you keep the oil ministry, but you don't keep the nuclear facilities, the message to many people may be, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	No
7024	And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	No
11787	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	No
24607	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	Yes
13481	Beyond that, as far as gold supply is concerned, and as far as gold movement is concerned, uh - we need to keep in mind that we need to get more help from our foreign allies in this great enterprise in which all free men are involved in winning the battle for freedom.	No
12872	If these two powers were to be divided, it could have great effects throughout the world.	No
13644	But we have faced it and we have done it, and we believe it is a just and shared sacrifice.	No
25989	Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	No
19451	But I've got a better idea.	No
14675	So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	No
19469	This is maintained with technology.	No
361	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living in the streets and gates of this country ten years ago.	Yes
32895	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	No
22008	It's always the most respected credit.	No
11677	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	No
25088	In Lebanon, this president was exercising American power, of course, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to go into humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, the terrorists became inflamed.	Yes
6898	The government doesn't require you to do anything.	No
1662	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	No
12442	Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.	No
1706	That's not the right answer for America.	No
24609	"I was a little disappointed by Magic because he came to see me and I said, ""If you see something we're not doing, just let me know."	No
23825	What separates my application and makes it unique is that it comes from millions of people in 50 states across the country who wanted a candidate who worked and belonged to them alone.	No
30129	And they're going to do that.	No
886	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	No
18645	Jim, the president has just said something unusually revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	No
18614	That's why it's essential we hold the line.	No
359	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	Yes
16134	So that's not where we ought to go.	No
14900	Our proposals are therefore very solid and very carefully taken into account to stimulate employment, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, while being anti-inflationary in nature.	No
8871	Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	Yes
22192	So we've got to innovate through school choice.	No
12475	This issue was too long on the table because it was a political issue.	No
3681	We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	No
9918	Including the senators who had already supported him on the Republican side.	No
7140	The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	Yes
33386	I voted for border security, and there's...	Yes
33308	We don't have countries if we don't have borders.	No
8244	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	No
20042	I remember one day I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped and said, why didn't we think of that before.	No
23995	And so I just have a different approach.	No
1938	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	No
33594	And I really want to make sure that women get equal pay for the work we do.	No
9196	We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	No
12529	Now, why did we succeed, for our predecessors did not succeed?	No
21698	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	No
11890	And to make sure that we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudices, it's education.	No
3617	I can tell you, it's rife.	No
22019	I agree with the governor.	No
11326	These are the challenges you don't have that end up consuming most of your time.	No
12577	Mr. Nixon indicated earlier that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even though the attack on these islands, two miles from the coast of China, was not part of a general attack on a Formosa and the Pescadores.	Yes
7983	Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	No
32088	She received it from the United States Congress.	Yes
23347	And therefore, they are like boxes with encumbers.	No
7047	We have added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.	Yes
32896	And this country can't take another four years from Barack Obama, and that's what you get with it.	No
15283	As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.	Yes
617	Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	No
17765	Whose taxes will you raise?	No
705	The Coast Guard attached themselves to the wharf this summer, not patrolling.	Yes
8234	It has a minimum of thirteen and two tenths of a billion dollars a year more than we currently spend up to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we currently spend.	Yes
27261	We cannot expect entrepreneurs and businesses, big and small, to take their life savings or their business money and invest in America if they think we are heading for Greece.	No
311	Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.	No
19541	We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	Yes
21602	Our homeownership initiative -- our homeownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed Congress is a good start for people to own their own homes instead of living in these murderous homes.	Yes
3564	And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	Yes
9717	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different period.	No
17143	And that is why Congress, including the Republicans, did not follow the President's recommendations.	Yes
16781	I think it is interesting to note that during the two years I was president, I vetoed 56 bills.	Yes
25376	But suppose we found this?	No
3777	We cannot adjust spending to take care of the much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans, but I also mean once again a healthy economy with low taxes would not increase the taxes of anyone is probably the best recipe to end up having our economy recover.	No
7664	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	No
16176	I'm for clean water.	No
25584	Tonight, we talked about the national force.	No
1855	And I think it would be a mistake.	No
9488	Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	No
11331	Despite all this, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	No
13134	The President of the United States indicated that they were not in the treaty area.	Yes
17601	With respect to Mr. Bush's murder of his tax problems and the difference with the tax he paid once, and then with the tax he paid later, I think that if you looked at the deductions, there was a big legal charge in there -- maybe you had to do it, with the sale of his house, and they had to do with his creation of a blind trust.	No
23597	You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.	No
29817	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	No
13713	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	Yes
28594	You know what the bad news is about this.	No
3680	Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.	No
12200	The highest 1% will pay one third of all federal income taxes.	Yes
6346	But having a situation, as you mentioned in our previous comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it requires reforms.	Yes
28521	I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	No
6686	We have increased Pell grants by a million students.	Yes
7149	They don't apply that kind of thing.	No
20969	But this is the time you're being tested not only -- it's the time to test your softness, a moment to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been reversed.	No
25891	Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the commander-in-chief to respond to something that has been said.	No
13350	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	No
27335	There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	No
5659	Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	No
1124	I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	No
15446	Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	No
33653	We're gonna bring the $2.5 trillion...	No
17803	It has to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't.	No
8979	And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	Yes
31983	Mine are words, and his was action.	No
19978	They're having a hard time making ends meet.	No
7612	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	No
27102	When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	Yes
11957	I think the marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
17491	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	No
918	I am opposed to supply management and production control.	No
23521	I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	No
7798	If we build our economy as we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	No
4145	The Iranians met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	No
29179	My father was a small-businessman.	No
27255	The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	No
23719	Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	No
19777	That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	No
13130	Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	Yes
18804	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the work we need to do with respect for the fight against terrorists all over the world.	No
12688	It would be an open invitation for Mr Khrushchev to enter, to come to Latin America and to engage in what would be a civil war, and perhaps even worse than that.	No
14727	As far as foreign affairs are concerned, some believe that this is irrelevant.	No
470	I think the vice president says he's willing to call a woman a criminal for making this decision.	No
11175	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, looks at the context of his words.	No
2082	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	No
28121	One of the most important things is to pursue research and development.	No
21761	Congress has in some way become institutionalized.	No
20787	As I said, almost 30% of them go to Americans who earn more than $1 million a year.	Yes
1598	"But I know that if the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than we are now."""	No
6060	We will ensure that insurance companies cannot discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	No
19836	There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	Yes
23488	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	Yes
22621	And that was the serious, serious threat.	No
34404	My Social Security contribution will increase, just like Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	No
18675	Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater ability to manufacture weapons at the time when the President invaded Saddam Hussein.	Yes
32908	She didn't answer, because when Ambassador Stevens...	Yes
23123	I have a plan that will allow the 55 to 64 people to buy in Medicare early.	No
2972	We have also seen a very serious problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which Mr Ford has just approved, which says that there is an organic link between the countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.	Yes
20776	Now, tell me who's standing on the side of the fence.	No
13968	I say in short that it does more good than bad if, if we can get some environmental protection so that Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labour law standards, and if we have a real commitment to re-educate and recycle American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	No
26958	Libya has 6 million inhabitants; Egypt has 80 million.	Yes
32874	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	Yes
13410	He's traveling to another country.	No
19098	We cut the deficit by 60%.	Yes
8425	We need a higher salary for teachers.	No
9069	We do not agree, I believe, on almost all the other issues.	No
29850	Who doesn't agree with neighborhood security?	No
3067	In the past, we have always had the ability to have a strong defence and also to have a strong national economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	No
24182	There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	No
15147	But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	Yes
19957	Go back to when he was, what, the Texas director for George McGovern.	No
27589	Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	No
20054	I said in 1992 that he did not give President Bush that courtesy.	Yes
25572	A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	No
11066	But understand that there is a lot of cruelty in the world.	No
845	So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	No
10156	They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	Yes
31937	We saw him insulting women.	Yes
20573	He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	No
19185	And it seems to me that if you look, are you better?	No
24640	The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	No
20957	They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	Yes
1440	Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	Yes
7339	He is a president who has not met with the Civil Rights Directorate of our country.	Yes
6032	And the last point I'm going to make, because we started on energy.	No
13973	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	No
17108	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending up to 6%.	Yes
3957	I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	No
7061	I see this as a serious problem.	No
25987	They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	Yes
33687	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	No
29799	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	No
31944	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	No
5535	I would like to mention that a few days ago Senator Obama was in Ohio and had a meeting with a plumber, his name being Joe Wurzelbacher.	No
32908	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	Yes
3285	And let me make another observation.	No
29867	Well, I -- I do think...	No
17212	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	Yes
14387	And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	Yes
28185	It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	No
1808	So if the tax plan he described was a tax plan that I was asked to support, I would say absolutely no.	No
9242	That's what I've done since I was president.	No
5998	And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	No
15069	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - other acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those living in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	Yes
29784	You can't say public order.	No
22909	Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	No
29781	Too many young African American and Latin American men have ended up in prison for non-violent offences.	Yes
705	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	Yes
10691	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	No
21861	Twelve per cent of our gross national product goes to health care.	Yes
33011	The question was about the Supreme Court.	No
6838	Well, it has not included the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government about $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	Yes
5797	But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	No
31982	If you look at Bill Clinton, much worse.	No
9909	He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.	No
20080	And I think we have the results to show we're on the right track.	No
10875	The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	Yes
8900	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in these cities today, we have 55% unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	Yes
10930	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	Yes
25503	And, in fact, the previous administration was in place, and I couldn't do anything in my position at that time, but to make this revolution happen.	Yes
24363	Recognize the legitimacy of these children carrying the Statue of Liberty.	No
18240	"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""	Yes
28923	If the wrong guy is killed, then it's a double tragedy.	No
8241	And in our case, I believe our programs will stimulate the creative energies of 180 million free Americans.	No
7330	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a struggle for positive action.	No
13912	We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	No
17533	And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has brought down agricultural exports by 20 per cent.	Yes
2146	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	No
20031	I mean, maybe you're sending a signal.	No
27692	We haven't done this yet.	No
28392	According to my plan, if you do -- the top -- the rich pay 62% of the taxes today.	Yes
3031	I have a strong feeling that we should sell weapons to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	No
17504	I don't know the answer at the beginning of life.	No
478	I respect his right to disagree with me.	No
26085	One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	No
12819	There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	No
6086	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you are a small business and you are able - and your - the guy who sells you will not increase his capital gains tax, what Senator Obama wants, if you're here, my friend, and you have employees, and you have children, if you don't get it - to adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama is charging, he will amend you.	Yes
20363	The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.	No
14046	And what you assume is that it makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	No
28557	There is a major program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we concentrated the money of federal taxpayers and federal prosecutors and went after people who illegally used firearms.	Yes
6842	We're beginning to do it.	No
7296	I put people behind bars for the rest of their lives.	No
13259	What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.	No
974	The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.	No
17977	We can better train Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can better prepare for the elections.	No
26355	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	No
28711	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	No
2442	Because there are two ways to deal with our health care crisis.	No
17276	And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	No
28901	I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	No
26949	We should put forward our foreign aid, our foreign direct investment and those of our friends, we should coordinate this aid to ensure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	No
354	Many of them are mentally ill.	No
4015	So I have a record.	No
14939	And my economic plan demands that.	No
26161	And if you have some -- and I have a certain age, experience, and intelligence -- it's all about wisdom.	No
26443	It doesn't look like the first two years we had a democratic president and a democratic congress.	No
12134	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'm just gonna leave that to that.	No
20489	The lives of the elderly and the lives of people living throughout the country.	No
1580	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	Yes
19500	Talking about this and this.	No
25895	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	No
2814	That's got to be changed.	No
26266	You guarantee that they have a chance to prove that they are competent.	No
25444	You've set up a Strategic Defence Initiative, an agency, you're starting to test, you're talking about deployment, you're asking for a budget of about $30 billion for that purpose.	Yes
19768	And I don't intend to politicize her.	No
8785	And today, on average, the average military is at least 15% - and I think that is a very modest estimate - 15% lower than what happened to the cost of living during this period.	Yes
10931	That's what I'd do.	No
15492	But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	No
168	Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	No
4240	I immediately said it was illegal and reprehensible.	Yes
12395	Exaggerations such as, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits as part of my health insurance reform program.	Yes
15642	And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	No
25550	Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	No
29200	When they sell -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	Yes
17496	One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.	Yes
1814	I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	No
25550	I cannot say that I participated in this round table and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and it is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	No
11484	Well, I think during the campaign, especially now during this difficult time, we should talk with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration worked hard to calm tensions.	No
7010	The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	Yes
7133	And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	No
19128	And Jack Kemp and I want to share some ideas with you tonight.	No
24919	You need to understand the region; you need to understand the policy in the region; you need to provide a strong alternative; and you need to be strong - and at the same time.	No
3802	And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	No
33097	We will choose a president who will set the policy not only for four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and many others, and so there are a lot of things at stake.	No
6452	We're proud to be here.	No
6197	But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	No
1440	From the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	Yes
25912	We had to make cuts.	No
12952	My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	No
21633	My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.	Yes
1830	And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	Yes
22868	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	Yes
356	But quite so, my short-term answer is to fully fund the McKinney Act.	No
24988	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	No
2422	You raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	Yes
6212	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this question.	No
15272	the model air pollution laws that have been passed in California have been passed on Governor Reagan's objections, and this is a well-known fact.	Yes
25791	And I now think that trust is being violated and it seems to me that we should deal with it, and the president should say tonight that he will not forgive anyone that he has been involved in matters with who could involve him later.	No
1385	The rule of a man, of a vote, which is a very important rule that has put an end to the unjustified influence in the parsley legislature - the populated areas of the states.	No
24604	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	Yes
20133	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	No
18898	There are terrorists trying to get hold of this thing today.	No
27236	We must do so responsibly by reducing the expenses we do not need, but also by asking the rich to pay a little more.	No
6492	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	No
27685	But it is important that we recognize that we cannot leave Pakistan.	No
22924	Just let me... I have to answer that.	No
11237	But we must also provide them with financial and practical assistance to help rebuild their economies.	No
23946	Now, I honour your service during the Second World War, I honour Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of all the men and women who served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your president of the common chiefs and who supports me.	No
32030	When I speak, I go out and talk, the people of this country are furious.	No
32932	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	Yes
33200	And the court did not accept this reasonable regulation, but they accepted many others.	Yes
26954	But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	Yes
540	The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	Yes
19957	Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.	No
21207	Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.	No
26049	He took three steps, twice we sent the welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	Yes
15759	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	No
19955	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	No
16599	This needs to be changed.	No
29150	They left -- they fired 1,400 people.	Yes
24792	We just have a bad system.	No
27675	We were supposed to get Osama bin Laden.	No
28502	And I'm glad to tell you that we did.	No
13834	Our government is that point now.	No
34054	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	No
8593	The other point I would like to make is this: this devalorization of the cost of things, I think that many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman administration when the government spent more than it took - we found savings on a life devoured by inflation.	Yes
32499	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	Yes
4072	Senator Obama said it would be provocative.	No
16491	I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	Yes
23123	I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	No
5529	We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	No
14841	That would be neat, plausible and false.	No
26788	The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	No
25426	"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here in the way I'm going to turn to the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we could sit with them and then say, ""Now, are you ready to join us?"	No
21886	The programs will be good because the elected ones will listen -- I said the other night that I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	No
93	It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	Yes
1734	High-income people are doing very well in this economy.	No
11559	It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.	No
6901	If you don't want to accept the offer of the plan I want to present, you didn't.	No
4048	So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	No
2897	I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	No
17587	At the same time, each year, it increased the amount of money -- almost every year, there may be one or two that were jumped in there -- that was subject to this tax.	Yes
12230	A few weeks ago, a study suggested that in the summer the northern polar ice cap would be completely extinct in 50 years.	Yes
15846	It's gotten a little nasty.	No
29725	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	Yes
16064	And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	No
8363	There is no guarantee that if you take a road or another, you will be a prosperous president.	No
30327	Can they rely on us?	No
18546	If you break it, you made a mistake.	No
19953	Their budget has decreased by $270 billion in Medicare, and their budget has withdrawn the national guarantee of health care for poor children, families with children with disabilities, the elderly in nursing homes, and poor pregnant women.	Yes
17703	I'm opposed to that, too.	No
1598	"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""	No
9183	Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	No
25039	And that is where the President's inability to control, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control cost us a great deal.	No
17403	I think we have something to do with that, as we have with the drug problem at the national level.	No
7804	We must also bear in mind something else about this whole situation in the world, and that is that as America moves forward, we must not only think in terms of fighting communism, but also think in terms of the interests of those countries.	No
19523	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	Yes
12631	And that's what I'm worried about.	No
8524	We should support the laws that the United States has enacted to protect us from those that will destroy us from the inside.	No
17099	And when they meet, it's a balanced budget.	No
32170	Right now, we're 90 percent of health insurance.	Yes
6127	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	Yes
33602	This is a plan that was analyzed by independent experts who said it could produce 10 million new jobs.	Yes
20947	But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.	No
19462	You walk in, you put your little card in there.	No
34267	And wait until you see what happens in the years to come.	No
30249	I agree with her on one thing.	No
5537	And he wanted to buy the business, but he looked at your tax plan and saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	No
1456	We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	Yes
6478	Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.	No
9196	We have not made the necessary progress to get people back to work.	No
2400	And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	Yes
22918	And they're over there, not here.	No
25036	I will keep this nation strong.	No
29800	Unfortunately, I think that too many of us in our great country draw conclusions on each other.	No
8055	I am studying history, like Senator Kennedy, and I have seen that, in the history of this country, we have had many great presidents.	No
21684	And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	No
6587	I have a loan from manufacturing jobs.	No
18159	Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	No
29658	I built an incredible company.	No
14648	It doesn't work that way when you're president.	No
17421	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	No
19779	That's why we're moving in the right direction.	No
16791	I was in a city in Pennsylvania not so long ago, near here, and there were about four or five thousand people in the audience, it was by train.	No
21304	We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.	Yes
18725	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	No
18800	We have guards and reservists who do double duties.	Yes
18400	It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	No
84	And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	No
22820	The army's job is to win the war.	No
22179	He's working in 1,700 communities -- bypassed the Congress on it, Ross -- 1,700 communities across the country.	Yes
3567	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	No
5568	The premise behind Senator Obama's plans is class war, let's spread wealth around.	Yes
1520	If we had so many people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Navy, our unemployment rate would be considerably lower.	No
7988	And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	No
19585	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	No
1920	We have 23 million unemployed people or we have stopped looking for work in this country.	Yes
28197	The number of uninsured persons has increased over the past seven years.	Yes
20557	Looks like the vice president's not very well tonight.	No
23839	I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	No
1346	of a crime a serious criminal offence, and that person is prosecuted, so, in my opinion, we are going to sue the person who uses the weapon for the wrong reason.	No
15581	No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	No
6898	The government doesn't demand that you do anything.	No
29147	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	No
12732	We will choose the best man we can get.	No
11152	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	No
24672	-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	No
14100	Give me a second...	No
29382	I'm going to cut taxes and you're going to raise taxes, end of story.	No
28250	I said there was a contrast.	No
8864	What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.	No
9669	That's part of what I'm fighting for as President of the United States.	No
20599	But it will be an interesting time for the Russians to accelerate and lead as well.	No
12742	Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	No
20030	Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	No
13681	It's quite different from some.	No
15642	And I think we know what they are: a strong good future, a future in which there are opportunities for all our citizens.	No
16601	We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	No
1300	We have an unemployment rate of 30 per cent or 40 per cent among minority youth.	Yes
15170	There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	Yes
24805	It's Washington in a nutshell right there.	No
792	And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	No
28200	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	No
25461	He's putting on a hair trigger, and it's a dangerous and destabilizing weapon.	No
29502	The Fed does policy -- maintaining interest rates at this level.	Yes
30011	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	Yes
15523	So I have great confidence in him.	No
20377	If you earn more than $25,000 a year, you do not get a loan under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, then you are pushed into a health insurance plan -- in a health insurance plan or insurance plan, and there is no limit on premiums, deductibles or any of the conditions.	Yes
3143	I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.	No
7823	Secondly, as we look at this unemployment problem, we need to see where it is.	No
19830	But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.	No
23961	Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.	Yes
28783	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need someone at the office who will tell the truth.	No
7087	In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	Yes
273	We just have a big difference about where this country should be headed, and in what direction it should go.	No
22135	We have to have money to do that.	No
9970	I don't check it that often.	No
20784	And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
12298	I think there's a difference.	No
33417	We will have no open borders.	No
13485	But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	Yes
12728	The President assumes constitutional responsibility, not the Secretary of State, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	No
9999	And it's time for them to get serious on it.	No
18985	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	No
13005	It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	No
297	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	No
13542	In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	No
2984	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	No
7176	What is he asking me, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	No
26568	"People say, ""I don't care."	No
17123	It was $200 billion deficit instead.	Yes
3003	We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	No
24626	Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	No
27495	But in time, what they can do is regain credibility.	No
272	But I salute him for his passion.	No
12834	But let's look at the other side of the coin.	No
22850	It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	No
16737	Encourage the president to keep people on purpose - yes.	No
14494	It's supposed to come from the people, it's from the people.	No
26613	In 1983, we expected to have a period of 75 years.	Yes
347	They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	No
8502	Let us now look at these bills that the Vice-Chair suggests are too extreme.	No
30325	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	No
19215	I doubt I recognized him this year.	No
19891	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but basically I went to public schools all my life.	No
7951	Our spending on defence, our spending on mutual security, our spending on economic assistance and technical assistance will not be lower.	No
7915	That is - my view is the same as his.	No
527	Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	No
13125	Now, that is the issue.	No
27747	They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	Yes
22966	Now, to get back to your question, Nikki, we will not get the best cooperation in the world today.	No
8491	We hope to control the Assembly, obtain a majority in this election.	No
19325	The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	No
2145	So, my approach is to say, how can we strengthen the system in the long term?	No
16282	These are the types of priorities for national security and foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I very much hope to be President and to pursue them.	No
10985	But the government mandates, I... I'm still a little nervous.	No
12390	And so I think this is an issue.	No
24910	And when a president doesn't know that submarine missiles remember, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers three years in his administration that our arms control efforts failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on earth -- these are things a president must know to command.	Yes
11602	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	No
18735	He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	No
24912	And he called him because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and lead our government and strengthen our nation.	No
136	It's not going to cost the government money.	No
7842	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr.Nixon referred to did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	Yes
19483	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	Yes
6909	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	Yes
20488	I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.	No
8512	The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.	No
3286	This morning, I got a call from the Mayaguez skipper.	No
15277	So we don't put restrictions on American exploration, we encourage it in every possible way.	No
12698	By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	Yes
18243	We're standing with you strong.	No
26533	I think it would help.	No
155	So the problem is - it's not that the job is too little taxed or the person who works - the woman working in a factory is too little taxed.	No
10042	I am very sensitive to the families of those who have lost loved ones.	No
19127	But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.	No
10768	Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	Yes
7467	I think you'll find someone you might be interested in.	No
2329	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	No
10067	But she works for me.	No
29594	I can tell you.	No
3564	And he is also right that often lobbyists and special interests are those who make such requests, although that was not the case with me.	Yes
32596	Hundreds of thousands of members of the National Guard and Reserve have health care because of the work I did, and children have safer medications because I was able to pass legislation that required more careful dosing.	Yes
27315	It was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	No
9810	Actually, he doubled it.	Yes
154	But the dynamics of the economy - we have reduced taxes and revenues are up 25 per cent in three years.	Yes
25229	For 31 and a half years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted the tabling of arms control proposals that had every hope of reaching an agreement, reprimanded their negotiator in 1981 when he approached an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	Yes
17036	The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	No
4017	"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	No
17378	Sometimes Mr. Mondale runs away.	No
20326	I believe we ought to give seniors more options.	No
241	We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	No
15188	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.	No
8444	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	Yes
3044	It is not a question of determining how this relationship should be achieved in relation to our current diplomatic recognition and the obligations to the Taiwanese government.	No
6039	If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	No
3750	We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.	Yes
22034	There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	No
6370	And it's great to be with you again.	No
20167	I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	No
18757	And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	Yes
7671	Secondly, what will he do to ensure fair employment?	No
11775	The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	No
189	And I think you'll see that people are unemployed.	No
24357	Not because they were tied up, but because the Administration was pushed to do something about it.	No
11861	I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	No
1507	And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	No
3243	He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	Yes
10523	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	Yes
6534	223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.	Yes
24264	We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	No
29456	You know, join the debate by saying crazy things.	No
18235	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	No
8995	For a return to traditions and values that we once had.	No
29700	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the following nine causes combined.	Yes
21336	And, as I say, we have had a difficult economic period, and it is the exports that have saved us, the exports that have built us.	No
20936	Secondly, one of the things we need to pay attention to in politics is to throw money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	No
8135	It is all things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or that can mean that it is still.	No
24137	But it is a good program.	No
27760	It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.	Yes
24468	It could be a single parent family.	No
33313	It means their job is tougher.	No
8329	But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	No
20283	I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	No
9310	With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	Yes
2886	I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	No
22420	I do not agree with both here on this point.	No
15375	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	No
16706	We must have a firm way of dealing with the issue of energy.	No
15262	And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.	No
18959	That is why we must be firm and determined to bring them to justice.	No
15382	When a man and a woman do the same job, a man is paid $1.00, a woman is paid only 59 cents.	Yes
25877	We were 18.	Yes
34339	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	No
7850	If we enter into a recession of sixty-one, then I agree that we need to invest more money in the economy, and that can be done by one of the two methods discussed.	No
6306	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reserves of teachers' unions.	Yes
27703	Remember, our strategy was not just about Ben Laden.	No
3337	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	Yes
22891	And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	Yes
3619	The U.S. Senate will pass a continuous resolution tomorrow or the next day, next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	No
8479	I would also say that when Senator Kennedy talks about the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on this committee and four Republicans.	Yes
4361	And I think the Americans will judge very seriously whether this is the right way or the wrong way and who should be the next president of the United States.	No
18600	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	No
27596	But when you were running in 2008, as I was, and I said if I had Bin Laden in our eyes, I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move the sky and the earth to get one man.	Yes
960	We had the opportunity to campaign across the country and meet so many of you in communities, states and regions to meet you.	No
27481	And we hope that their leadership will make the right decision, but the agreement we will accept is that they end their nuclear program.	No
13894	I never said that we should write it in the law if there is evidence that this goal cannot be achieved.	Yes
4074	This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe that we can act and act with our friends and allies and reduce this threat as soon as possible, but we have no doubt about the ultimate outcome of the acquisition of nuclear weapons.	No
27248	I'm going to get America to work again and see the pay rise to take home again, and I'm going to do it with five simple steps.	No
21311	Pay $1 an hour for your job, don't have health care -- it's the most expensive single item in car manufacturing.	Yes
32465	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	No
18305	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	No
15373	And today you will see that this promise is at the very heart of what republicanism represents in this country today.	No
78	But we also have to take demand seriously.	No
21009	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	No
7513	I'm asking for your help.	No
24667	I'll have a unique mandate.	No
2505	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and make sure that all the good things that are in there are there and that you don't have to worry.	Yes
12604	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	Yes
3715	I saved taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting against a negotiated contract between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	Yes
23035	And that's why we do what we do.	No
33173	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	No
32570	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	Yes
29001	Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.	No
6860	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	Yes
20168	I know who I am, and I know where I come from, and I know where I want to take America from.	No
28637	And I hear my farmers and friends all the time.	No
6348	But I'm not gonna keep throwing money at a problem.	No
24585	I tried to use the White House as a chair of intimidation, speaking against discrimination.	No
8757	Because in today's industry, we produce more, in recent years, and 12% less energy than we were in 1973.	Yes
12741	Let me recall that its Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut $80 million from the Vote of America's credits.	Yes
18912	And we're going to get the job of containing all this nuclear material in Russia in four years.	No
10638	I struggled to reduce assignments and eliminate them.	Yes
9473	Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	No
26761	I hope I have given a clear answer.	No
11737	And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	No
7692	The right to vote is fundamental.	No
1944	Well, first of all, I'm going to eliminate all the programs by this test, if they don't pass: Is the program so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	No
12877	But if India fails - with its four hundred and fifty million people, if it cannot make freedom work - people around the world will determine - especially in the underdeveloped world - that the only way to develop their resources is through the communist system.	No
21411	I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.	No
11880	We can do better in our public schools.	No
20843	Two is to say that if you want to access the reading money, you can do it.	No
14126	You know, I've been in public life for a long time and nobody had ever questioned my role, so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I've answered them as well as I could.	No
16885	For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	No
786	You judge on the record.	No
24946	And so he was a man there in this field where it was delivered, and he acknowledged that what was in this manual was in direct violation of my own executive order, in December 1981, that we would have nothing to do with political assassinations.	Yes
19472	And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	No
28960	So it's a state demonstration.	No
8011	We say we will defend it if it is part of a general attack on Formosa.	No
18240	"My opponent at one point said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll get them out of there in six months."""	Yes
30441	Well, I support our democracy.	No
20904	First of all, I have mandatory tests.	No
14842	The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before my assumption of the presidency, has seen its own military force diminish.	Yes
3580	But the point is -- you see, I hear that all the time.	No
9297	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
15983	I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	No
3895	First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.	No
34444	We have to help him, we have to fix him.	No
3568	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	Yes
5634	I just want to go back to the property of this house.	No
9450	Middle-income people will get tax relief.	Yes
13404	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	No
4108	Maybe he's not the right person to talk to.	No
1219	Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	Yes
6309	If we don't agree, it's the idea that we can somehow give good -- give good as a way to ensure the problems of our education system.	No
21810	So if you analyze where we disagree with other countries, you will find the following conclusions.	No
17851	"And I think the answer to that must also be ""yes""."	No
10917	And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even shake.	No
15374	That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	No
25551	And it seems to me that it could be a complement, or certainly a great helper to do that.	No
29172	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	No
3997	"We had a 20th century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	No
21335	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	No
29309	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	Yes
26810	There are very fundamental differences in this campaign.	No
3077	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as in Italy; it is three or four times higher than in Japan.	Yes
25951	Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	No
24271	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	Yes
8003	I therefore believe that, in this respect, we can balance the budget unless there is a national emergency or a serious recession.	No
3893	And Senator Obama, who, after promising not to vote to cut funds for troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut funds for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	Yes
13281	Both Guinea and Ghana have moved into the Soviet sphere of foreign policy, as well as Cuba.	Yes
16984	There has been too much government secrecy and not enough respect for the privacy of American citizens.	No
7861	I believe that our power and prestige have diminished over the past eight years.	No
16749	To do this, we need to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we need to improve our use of coal - making it more efficient and cleaner.	No
17025	In his acceptance speech, Governor Carter called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	No
7398	There's one for people who have, and there's one for people who don't.	No
29220	How do you get them to bring jobs back?	No
23282	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	No
15435	And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	No
10443	And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	No
32692	And Iran is killing ISIS.	Yes
20700	Whether or not it is -- the same thing about domestic politics too.	No
11735	That's really all we can do.	No
13515	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	Yes
5989	And I think we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get a little more oil.	No
8727	I grant you that prices can rise, because as you go further and you have to go further, you increase the cost of production.	No
13010	But let's look at him.	No
2112	And I remember, as governor, when this idea was launched by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republicans and Democrats -- said, please, let's do it.	No
23053	John, you heard the president say he thought he might try to be for that.	No
25038	To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	No
1766	On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	Yes
33725	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
7746	Every time the United States has been on the one hand and on the other, our position has been maintained.	Yes
15177	And they have succeeded, despite all our arms control attempts, in moving forward with the greatest military build-up in human history.	Yes
34098	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	No
27916	That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	No
15041	Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	Yes
1267	In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	Yes
20376	It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	No
29372	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the world.	No
27517	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	No
3154	Mr. Ford didn't move on.	Yes
12258	I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	No
17790	If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	Yes
880	When the Vice-President makes a decision, it will be his decision.	No
11407	He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	No
26510	And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	Yes
25208	What is at stake here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a president needs to know to lead this nation, to ensure our defence, and to make the decisions and judgments that are necessary.	No
16446	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	No
28621	It's not the right thing to do.	No
2481	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	No
20420	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	No
10867	Senator Obama opposed it.	Yes
11510	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	No
19270	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	No
14700	First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	No
22420	I differ with the 2 here on that.	No
26623	And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	No
26403	We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	No
8219	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	No
18706	My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	No
1126	There are some who claim, I cannot prove it true or false, that such a statement has in fact invited North Koreans to invade South Korea.	No
26482	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	No
16738	In addition, the private sector should be encouraged to - publicize the benefits of efficiency.	No
25198	But it was a surprise for us, because they surpassed us from 64 to 36 in the submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	Yes
1944	Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	No
24297	It's a very unstable situation.	No
3005	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasted defence facility, it encourages the kind of pressure that has been successfully exerted on us.	No
13852	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	No
22024	On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	No
4327	We have done some work to reach potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	No
15965	And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	No
450	I don't prefer abortion.	No
2682	We -- as president, I'm going to sit on the first day -- actually, the day after my election -- I'm going to sit down with the leaders -- the democratic leaders, as well as the Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a few hours, we talked about the issues and challenges in -- in our state in that case.	No
355	And we have to take care of them.	No
26822	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	No
11078	I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.	No
26459	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	No
17363	They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	No
16807	It shows a lack of leadership.	No
6966	We will honour our commitment to our elders.	No
18286	When I talked about $87 billion, I made a mistake in the way I'm talking about war.	No
8663	But I want to answer as precisely as possible the question you have just asked me.	No
11896	The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	No
2337	We didn't think about it properly.	No
26472	But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	No
3343	So far, Mr. Ford has not.	Yes
24857	We need to do better in terms of job recycling.	No
24436	But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	No
15770	And thank God the frozen people were not heard.	No
24948	What should a president do when taking an oath?	No
7763	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	Yes
7526	And we've been through a lot together over the last three years.	No
25817	We've always had at least 7 percent.	Yes
12297	This is what we should do at the federal level when it comes to acquired rights plants for public services.	No
13871	That's one of the things I want to change.	No
6266	In general, what happened was that there was a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	No
19215	I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	No
12450	I want to reduce the size of classrooms in this country.	No
20905	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	No
7995	You cannot tell me that anyone who uses beans rather than meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them, according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or well fed.	Yes
32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	No
27630	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in our country think Pakistan is nice to us, and we should get away with it.	No
2479	It's the private market.	No
16606	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	No
19807	But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	No
1038	At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.	Yes
6575	He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	Yes
18173	And there's a long list of things.	No
18846	First of all, I greatly appreciate the personal comments that the President has just made.	No
3856	You're talking about the surge.	No
4326	Of course, we have contributed billions of dollars to airport security.	Yes
12905	He said he had voted in favour of the resolution.	Yes
30054	But we must be aware of the fact that they have had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we must make this the top priority.	Yes
13766	I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	No
13124	"Now, when Senator Green, the chair of the Senate Committee on External Relations, wrote to the chair, he received again on October 2, 1958 - ""Neither you nor any other American need think that the United States will be involved in military hostilities only for the defence of Quemoy and Matsu."""	Yes
20029	But it seems to me that the president should have no comment at all.	No
24411	I will stick to it and use the moral persuasion of the United States to achieve satisfaction with regard to the prison camps, and we are making progress there, and with regard to humanitarian aid in there.	Yes
5775	And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	Yes
11359	I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	No
19520	We just had the election there.	No
7242	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	No
8063	"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	No
9015	I do not believe in the constitutional amendments that would interfere with that.	No
2487	This is the wrong way.	No
19898	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	No
7902	It wouldn't be appropriate for me to do it.	No
22622	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	No
19422	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, getting out and frightening older people and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like that.	No
30202	AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	No
14189	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	No
21559	I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	No
3532	And Main Street pays a penalty for excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and Wall Street.	Yes
8279	Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found, uh - somewhat unsatisfactory on the numbers, uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman administration.	No
20122	There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	Yes
2968	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	No
29556	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	Yes
2235	And so you have higher administrative costs, plus profit in addition to that.	No
4103	Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	No
718	I'm not going to reconsider my position.	No
10128	But some of them are also looking at other sources of violence.	No
22851	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	No
12113	If you allow -- also allow -- to convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match with her some of the money from the child health insurance, the purchasing power of the pool.	No
29042	You haven't seen anything yet.	No
19525	I have a different vision.	No
23037	There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	No
19042	We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	No
25273	They are difficult negotiators, but all previous presidents have made progress.	No
2280	I mean, you need to have regulations so you can have a job of economy.	No
27818	My plan to set up the industry when it really had problems was not to start writing checks.	No
1602	But I believe together we can make great progress.	No
13701	And I'm going to do that.	No
34152	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once in Iraq, you should never have left.	No
17804	And I hope we can start paying before we get here.	No
1030	The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	No
29704	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	No
11030	My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	No
26658	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	No
33393	He used undocumented work to build the Trump Tower.	Yes
33273	Well, I think it's terrible.	No
20033	But as president of the United States, when someone asks for forgiveness, you don't say any comment, period.	No
22306	Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	No
32211	This is where the vast majority of people receive their health care.	Yes
25210	I want to quote someone closer to my home, Harry Truman.	No
16473	At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	Yes
10636	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	Yes
19537	So we need more protection from America.	No
17557	In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.	Yes
11835	And not just training in police procedures, but human relations.	No
18590	When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	No
879	He himself said, and rightly so, that he would be a strong vice-president.	No
22478	I thought I owed you this and that I respected you to be here and the impact you had on that more positive experience.	No
12465	There's too many issues left unresolved.	No
13953	And it's true about that and it's true about CAFE.	Yes
13613	The rich pay a higher percentage of the total tax burden.	Yes
1188	As I recall, he indicated that General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	No
14678	They break the legs of business in different ways.	No
12514	There is a question that stands out above all, a question that concerns every American, whatever group he or she can be a member of and wherever he or she can live.	No
12530	I think there're several reasons.	No
11746	And we must also be very careful in the way we use our army.	No
17087	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	No
7020	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	Yes
23643	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	No
22361	I don't know -- from 4 years old.	No
29691	We must restore trust between the communities and the police.	No
33524	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	No
20840	Unfortunately, however, many schools imprison children in schools that do not teach and do not change.	No
6148	You just heard my plan.	No
14051	And as soon as I found out, he got out of the door.	No
4115	"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	No
8582	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	No
20486	I was disappointed by the decision because I think abortions should be rarer in America, and I'm worried that this pill will create more abortions and make more people have abortions.	No
30399	.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	No
1969	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid; and a bunch of programs that were not paid; and then a massive economic crisis.	No
13275	Thirdly, the Pre-President suggests that we remain in doubt about the Communists as to whether we will fight against Quemoy and Matsu.	No
6836	That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	No
11686	During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	No
1688	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	No
24987	And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	No
14916	It has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect of passing the Senate.	Yes
2658	I don't just talk about it.	No
22765	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	No
33622	Why is NATO not being questioned? Why are they not paying?	No
8548	For example, we have a gross national product of about five hundred billion dollars.	Yes
897	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jump on the President on his decision on an area of agricultural policy.	No
15868	Those are basic American values.	No
21256	One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	No
29235	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
25592	As President, I would like to insist on strong long-term economic growth.	No
18096	In fact, it is a global effort.	Yes
19139	For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	Yes
1723	And that's where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan requires a $5 trillion tax reduction -- in addition to the expansion of Bush's tax cuts -- is another trillion dollars -- and two trillion dollars in additional military spending that the military has not asked for.	Yes
23242	The stock market was down six months before I arrived.	Yes
16865	The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	Yes
13084	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	No
32623	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last Syrian rebels who really oppose the Assad regime.	Yes
25147	The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	Yes
26908	With the Arab Spring, we had great hopes that there would be a shift towards greater moderation and greater participation of women in public life and economic life in the Middle East.	No
29703	We have to work with the police.	No
28801	For example, in our state of Texas, I worked with the legislature, Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said that if you come into the top 10% of your high school class, you are automatically admitted to one of our higher learning institutions, college.	Yes
18944	It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	No
14544	And you want to do something about all that extra spending on me and Mr. Perot?	No
1055	I don't know how to do it.	No
27113	I don't want our military to be involved in Syria.	No
20852	And Michael Feinberg, too.	No
34130	They want to be beautiful.	No
28991	There was a chance to do it.	No
29226	We wish you a lot of luck.	No
27647	And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	Yes
32810	Destroying what's happening to our cities.	No
15649	And I know these campaigns are often hit, but I think I would be a better president now for having to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of the neighbourhood.	No
24242	Give me a chance to do that.	No
15802	In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	No
29955	But last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	Yes
3236	While the Secretary of State is in one country, there are almost one hundred and fifty others who wonder what we will do next, which will be the next secret agreement.	No
29566	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	No
19982	These are American jobs and opportunities.	No
33251	And in this case, it's not just Roe v. Wade.	No
7443	And my opponent has a retirement and defeat plan in Iraq.	No
1752	But the president mentioned a few other ideas that I'm just going to note.	No
10499	Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.	Yes
26922	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	Yes
19951	Their budget weakened our support for education.	No
26599	Well, we have in our economic package -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	No
14410	The worst part is that, once again, it's a mistake.	No
24603	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	Yes
29231	And that's a big, big factor.	No
25512	And I think we've had enough of a record to leave -- under the guise of revolution -- someone we thought was a little bit fairer than we would be, letting that person go, and then ending with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as an alternative.	No
27723	But as far as China is concerned, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner of the international community if it follows the rules.	No
5919	They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	No
14415	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	Yes
22188	And it works... it works in Milwaukee.	Yes
8019	We should defend ourselves.	No
34447	We take care of illegal immigrants, people who enter the country illegally, better than we take care of our veterinarians.	Yes
14404	I said it's simple.	No
913	Biodegradable plastic-plastic-gasohol, in which the Vice-President participated, road deicing made from maize products.	Yes
24295	Thirdly, we have all kinds of agreements on paper, and some are executed to get rid of nuclear warheads.	Yes
5708	The Americans are hurting tonight, they're angry and I understand, and they want a new direction.	No
16845	DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.	Yes
14592	Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	No
25852	Got a 3% increase this year, but that's not enough.	Yes
2305	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits to...	No
8912	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	No
14016	Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	No
1404	And, uh-- that would be another factor that I would follow.	No
6686	We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
31848	I want to be the president of all Americans, whatever your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	No
8305	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	No
70	These are the values I want to bring to the Presidency and the White House from January 1989 onwards.	No
8472	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	Yes
20112	But we will have the rest of this tax relief.	No
17565	Mr. Reagan, after the election, will have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	No
26828	I promise you, the economy will improve.	No
3060	In the Far East, I believe that we must continue to be strong and to pursue the normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China.	No
22616	Seventy-five per cent of them have been brought to justice.	Yes
22741	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him stuck in the mountains.	No
9600	And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	No
26797	It's not about President Clinton.	No
33195	And so when I think about what we have to do, we have 33,000 people dying of firearms a year.	Yes
25238	This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	No
33268	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	No
12565	We must have a great goal.	No
27202	But to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	No
9051	And some people in senior management positions tell us that the answer is to withdraw.	No
19830	But why wouldn't everyone have a choice.	No
21481	You have to say what you're for and you have to...	No
30250	The biggest problem in the world is nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, not global warming, as you think and as your President thinks.	No
1704	Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	No
11532	And we have maintained the sanctions.	Yes
28859	If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.	Yes
13710	4th in manufacturing, 4th in poverty reduction, 4th in income growth.	Yes
2215	So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	Yes
2513	I -- I have to respond to that.	No
25711	We have ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit has been reduced by 60 per cent.	Yes
21891	That's the way the game's played now.	No
5794	Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	Yes
16255	"And I think if we get rid of the labels - and I don't count, but I think Mr. Bush used the ""liberal"" label at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I would be eligible for one of those tax breaks for the rich you want to give."	No
9278	I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewable energies.	No
14956	And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.	Yes
32170	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	Yes
26201	As I said earlier, they have no ideas.	No
27452	I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	No
1532	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	No
13799	He really had no new economic agenda for more than 1300 days in his presidency, and his entire health care initiative has not yet been presented to Congress.	Yes
1829	And you thought, so why lower prices?	No
25874	We will start working on the first day in the Dole-Kemp administration.	No
26615	Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for a while and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	Yes
18526	I have drawn up a plan by which I think we can succeed in Iraq: with a summit, by making better formations, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do about the UN and the elections.	No
25341	And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	No
26008	And we will do that.	No
7393	And as I measure the words of the Bible - and we all do; different people measure different things - the Qur'an, the Torah, or, you know, the Amerindians who blessed me the other day had their own sense of connection to a superior being.	No
25565	But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.	Yes
27090	And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	No
1389	But now I think there have been a few cases in which the Burger Court has rendered technical decisions where a person clearly guilty was subsequently found guilty.	Yes
29434	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a big thing for the rich.	No
16679	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	No
3987	Now I think it's the right strategy; I think it's the right policy.	No
27984	I'm going to make sure people are taken out of the food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by giving them good jobs.	No
31995	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	Yes
8384	In my opinion, hard money, tight monetary policy, the fiscal policy of this administration contributed to the slowdown in our economy, which helped to cause the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which slowed our economic activity somewhat in 1960.	No
16252	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	No
13476	Von Fremd, the first thing we need to do is to keep trust abroad in the US dollar.	No
19561	He has deployed more troops than any president in world history.	Yes
8498	With respect to Senator Kennedy's proposals, I am also saying that, again, the issue is not simply a presidential veto that puts an end to the programs.	No
20082	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	No
11495	He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.	No
23844	And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	No
20489	Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	No
20090	President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.	Yes
3261	We kept control as if we had sovereignty.	No
23267	I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	Yes
12697	We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.	No
15255	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	Yes
6036	That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	No
20707	I think that's an important part of leadership.	No
26722	Let me give you a few examples very briefly.	No
25310	And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	No
20321	Today's system has been very important for many older people, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	No
7597	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	No
12658	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	Yes
29644	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	No
8275	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	Yes
22733	They're not gonna follow an American president who says he's following me in a mistake.	No
493	But, Peter, it's quite true, entering a completely different phase of things.	No
9217	And Governor Romney says he has a five-point plan?	No
9067	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	No
16868	My average in two years is twenty-six.	Yes
21494	I was disturbed by the tone and content of this campaign.	No
400	We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	No
25136	During a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts were committed in 20 countries.	Yes
30125	And I think we should get -- because we pay about 73 percent of NATO's cost.	Yes
11175	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	No
8421	Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	No
23212	Thank you for your question.	No
2231	Jim, if I -- if I can answer very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that health insurance has lower administrative costs than private insurance, which is why seniors are generally rather satisfied with it.	Yes
10678	We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.	No
15339	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	Yes
12551	In addition to military strength, we must ensure that this country's economy continues to grow.	No
14085	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	No
28488	Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	No
19927	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	Yes
32248	We're going to block the subsidy in the states.	No
6144	You've noticed, they've been in charge for the last two years.	No
3091	But I can guarantee that it will not come if Gerald Ford is re-elected and this current policy is pursued; it will come if I am elected.	No
14989	And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	Yes
28837	Positive action means that you are taking additional steps to recognize the history of discrimination, injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everyone, not just those who benefit directly.	No
19260	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	Yes
9231	It's-- this Detroit-- this Detroit response...	No
34430	And I know the incredible responsibility to protect our country and the incredible opportunity to work to try to make life better for all of you.	No
12811	We ought to make one last effort.	No
8434	Teachers' salaries have fortunately increased by fifty per cent over the past eight years, compared with only a thirty-four per cent increase for other salaries.	Yes
19147	These are areas in which Senator Dole and I diverged, but I thought they were the right places for America to act together as a country to help individuals and families make the most of their lives and raise their children with good values and a good future.	No
14910	In fact, today we import about a third less oil from overseas than a year ago.	Yes
23917	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	No
16243	Someone hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you should talk about more questions.	No
14815	America never fought because we were too strong.	No
25110	But the first - forgive me - the first time we entered, we entered at their request because the war continued in Beirut between Israel and PLO terrorists.	Yes
14434	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there is no evidence that these grain credits were diverted to weapons -- none, none.	Yes
16396	That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	No
393	But that, too, will require some choices.	No
27220	We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	No
17967	But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	No
14448	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with S&L was to deregulate them without appropriate capital requirements, appropriate oversight and regulation, appropriate management training.	Yes
27788	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	No
12772	Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.	No
13029	It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	No
19290	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	Yes
18188	It's quite another subject, but I see we still have a little more time.	No
19150	The President trusts the government.	No
6372	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult moments and challenges for America.	No
7713	I would hope an incident like that would not happen.	No
26842	This is a very important election.	No
14827	And my tax reduction is not close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	Yes
20755	He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	No
8951	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	Yes
26370	He said it would hurt the economy.	No
28510	It must be in the national interest, it must be in our vital interest if we ever send troops.	No
2001	That's what we've done, made some adjustments, and we're doing it before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	Yes
24818	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	No
8013	In 1958, then Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Herter stated that they were strategically indefensible.	Yes
23537	I think we need to respect life in order to do so ethically.	No
28555	If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	No
3558	Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	No
20306	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	No
18056	These words mean something to me, as someone who has been in combat.	No
23106	Ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends are trying to get away with it.	No
7532	Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	No
3567	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	No
17582	And, in fact, it turns out that in the pitfalls of administering these taxes, those of more than $50,000 did not get a tax reduction percentage as high as those of $50,000 down.	Yes
8949	We're halving the rate of increase in spending.	Yes
19800	We have people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	No
18736	On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	No
3900	We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	No
19541	We agreed to train and arm Muslims so that they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you were running in 1992.	Yes
23650	Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.	No
8878	That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.	No
2876	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	No
8670	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, perhaps saving up to $5 to $7 billion, according to one of the main members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index used to determine the cost of living benefits paid to public service retirees, military retirees.	Yes
25596	America is not temporary; we're forever.	No
11622	I wouldn't have supported it either.	No
7791	And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	Yes
26114	We also have capital gains now for those who invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	Yes
3107	Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	No
28185	That will be one of the themes you'll hear tonight.	No
7946	And all I'm saying is that I don't know what the 1960s will bring - except that I think they will bring difficult moments into the international sphere; I hope we can move forward here in the United States; I am convinced that we can do much better work to mobilize our economy and resources in the United States.	No
26961	And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).	Yes
14813	Therefore, the burden of peacekeeping lies with us.	No
22305	Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.	Yes
33413	You'd have a trade disaster, and you'll have a disaster with your open borders.	No
8622	That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	No
26056	This is the United States of America.	No
7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	No
2943	I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	Yes
25745	I appreciate the young man's quote.	No
15247	But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	Yes
1174	The only major decision I have made since the appointment was made, and I share it with President Ford, is the choice of a Vice-President.	No
23085	That's what leadership is all about.	No
919	I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.	No
14464	But I think -- I was just looking at some of the American Bankers Assn's procedures, and I think the general feeling is that most banks are healthy, certainly there is no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks are right now, in my opinion.	No
922	I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.	No
22935	He denigrates a covenant to say that we are going alone, to reduce their sacrifices.	No
24291	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	No
8012	But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	No
13634	Our challenge is to stop the financial hemorrhage.	No
23527	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	No
3319	It's a matter of morality.	No
32248	We're going to block grant into the states.	No
25905	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	No
13444	We want to make sure it's fair and fair.	No
5702	The mayor of New York City, Mayor Bloomberg, has just imposed a spending freeze on New York City.	Yes
34264	And that's what caused the great migration, where it takes tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, which probably in many cases -- not probably, which are definitely...	Yes
12443	This race is values, it's change, it's choices for the American people.	No
9050	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	No
11729	It must be in our vital interest, the mission must be clear and the additional strategy clear.	No
16353	But again, I don't know what George Bush I'm listening to.	No
19124	Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	No
14939	And my economic plan calls for that.	No
27166	We want people to enjoy their lives and know that they will have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	No
7832	I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	No
27822	And in this process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they have to go through bankruptcy to get rid of the excess cost and debt burden they had accumulated.	Yes
7107	We have to start moving them to full citizenship, out of the shadows.	No
20644	I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
14066	All these things take a few minutes.	No
24921	This is a classic example of a strategy that embarrasses us, strengthens our opposition and undermines the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	No
15242	Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	Yes
2506	And at some point, I think the American people should ask themselves, is that why Governor Romney keeps all these plans to replace the secret because they're too good?	No
15925	But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	No
15069	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	Yes
2219	I know my point of view is that I'd rather have a private plan.	No
7841	We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
22889	We don't need mass armies anymore.	No
12685	Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	No
23225	This is the biggest turning point in the country's history.	Yes
2000	If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	No
3232	Last year, under Mr.Ford, of all the food for peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	Yes
13872	I know that we can develop jobs in the manufacturing sector.	No
13235	But when a president of a U.S. man, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	No
1706	That is not the right answer for America.	No
12567	To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	No
34434	I will do everything I can to ensure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your children have a good education from kindergarten to college.	No
24789	I don't like to see the principles of the country violated.	No
8899	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	Yes
3697	Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.	No
23344	We have proposed and passed a bill on healthy forests, which was essential to working with - particularly in Western states - to ensure that our forests are protected.	Yes
17529	And I don't agree with it.	No
3784	John, it was your president who said you agreed with 90% of the time that presided over this increase in spending.	Yes
31848	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	No
10131	And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	No
24997	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	No
28412	But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	Yes
21557	See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?	No
25190	Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	No
15145	The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	Yes
22124	And only the US could do this.	No
7083	There are many people standing in the line to become a citizen.	No
16251	(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	No
24355	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	No
21833	Ross was very articulate across the country.	No
19645	First of all, let me answer this question on the 1982 tax reduction.	No
3956	Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	No
5623	The programs we need, we should make them more effective.	No
6748	And if it's overturned, we'll end up defining marriage by the courts, and I don't think it's in the interests of our nation.	Yes
16721	There should be a standard design.	No
33037	I will bring our energy companies back.	No
13085	We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	No
14690	Look at the 24 retired generals and admirals who supported me, including the Deputy Commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
10962	He begins by saying that the government will do so and the government will do it, then the government will do it, and that it will impose mandates.	No
9905	And that's what I've done administratively.	No
21508	I want to change the character of the presidency.	No
1758	The second area, taxation, we agree, we should cut tax rates.	No
7050	It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.	No
23059	Ladies and gentlemen, the President has simply not been comfortable with you right now.	No
26404	You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	No
1127	It's a fact they did.	Yes
34113	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	No
29225	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	No
21657	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	No
32522	People like Donald, who paid zero taxes, zero for our veterinarians, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that's not true.	Yes
7896	I say that the American people do not want to return to these policies.	No
6110	If you don't have health insurance or want to buy a group plan, you can buy the plan I just described.	No
18914	This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.	No
16078	Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an extra burden for older citizens.	No
15186	Governor Reagan makes very misleading and disturbing statements.	No
20118	It came with a high rate of growth, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had very difficult cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	No
13014	Twenty new African countries during this administration.	Yes
8419	I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	No
23440	I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.	Yes
22280	Well, if we don't fix this, you're right.	No
21252	We're at a fork in the road.	No
17286	All history tells us that that's a mistake.	No
21594	Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	No
17983	We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	No
4273	And that will, I think, have an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	No
26404	You know, I fell off a platform in California, Chico, a while ago.	No
1543	As a result of this wonderful experience across the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	No
10440	And many of you are worried about your jobs, pensions, retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or grandson to college.	No
8858	The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	Yes
21660	The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.	No
6906	And in return, if states want -- they don't have to, they can choose -- they cover up to 300 percent of poverty.	Yes
566	And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.	Yes
19513	And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	Yes
14532	Well, how about this for a government reform policy?	No
8343	I met with the legislative leaders.	No
15260	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	Yes
6015	The technology is there and we have to drill now.	No
16206	The George Bush, who was the charter member of the crew of environmental wrecks that went to Washington in the early 1980s and did work on the EPA, or the one we saw and listened to over the past two or three months.	No
21705	In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	Yes
13759	Jim, I don't think it's a good move.	No
23087	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	Yes
23604	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	No
15186	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	No
19856	I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	Yes
21618	Of course, but the problem is that you get so many things included in a big bill that you have to look at the right one overall.	No
34340	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	No
872	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	No
8118	If we fail, then freedom fails.	No
11515	But it will not be on my calendar, it will be on the calendar with which people are comfortable in the Middle East.	No
22889	We don't need any more mass armies.	No
21163	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you look like a bad person.	No
17698	They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.	No
4258	Over 26, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, such as solar, wind and biodiesel.	Yes
6930	It is estimated that 8 million people will move from private insurance to public insurance.	Yes
12017	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	Yes
3001	If you include Iran, our current transport of weapons to the Middle East, only 20% goes to Israel.	Yes
20661	Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.	No
1398	I would also like to completely review our criminal justice system to do some things at the federal level in the court reform that I have just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	No
19293	In fact, it will increase taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will impose greater reductions in health insurance, Medicaid, education and the environment than those that he and Mr Gingrich adopted that I vetoed last year.	Yes
8762	Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	No
33446	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	Yes
15639	The fact is that the next president of the United States will have to go to the White House seriously, he will have to work with Congress seriously, he cannot turn to Congress and blame them for the fact that we do not have a balanced budget and we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	No
7887	I participated in the discussions that led to decision-making within this administration.	No
19334	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr President.	No
1889	But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.	No
23070	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	Yes
32746	... for weeks -- I've been reading about Mosul for weeks, that this is the port from where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, that's where they think ISIS leaders are.	Yes
3158	We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	Yes
21139	We need to think differently about the issue.	No
27034	You must be clear to our allies and enemies about your position and what you mean.	No
17680	I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	No
22642	He can't come here and tell you that he didn't leave any children because he didn't fund any children left behind.	Yes
29964	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	No
18715	I just think that trying to be popular, in a way, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest has no meaning.	No
20001	But the important thing is what we're gonna do now.	No
14544	And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	No
19194	They're talking about the rise in family income.	No
27598	And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	No
1149	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	No
29734	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	No
31888	I'm not proud of it.	No
7253	The people I spoke to their minds were high.	No
24182	There are big plans all over Washington, no one ever executes.	No
288	I don't want my 10-year-old grandson to go into an X movie.	No
1575	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	No
17684	The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	No
8967	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	Yes
33730	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	Yes
9583	And I have just described -- I have just described to you, Mr. Speaker -- I have just described to you precisely how I would do it, who is with a single number that people can put -- and they can say they are -- these are deductions and credits...	No
12547	That is why I say that in this period of the 1960s America must move forward in all areas.	No
13386	Well, what he says here in fact, we're going to have inflation.	No
33098	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	No
33001	Why aren't you putting some money in?	No
14325	We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	Yes
2096	But, you know, if we get this tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	No
6505	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	No
825	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	No
24284	Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	No
7833	So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	No
27800	Now that it is estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is that they will not be there, they will be in places like China.	Yes
2859	The foreign policy of the United States under this administration has been progress and success.	No
32536	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	Yes
17154	"But I'm gonna break that rule and say ""never."""	No
19781	That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	No
1470	And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	Yes
27393	Now we're changing to one conflict.	Yes
32834	Take a look at upstate New York.	No
7921	It's going to be a test of our strength.	No
11835	And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.	No
16	I think we have seen a deterioration in values.	No
17226	[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.	Yes
13298	And that's my point of view now.	No
25828	But if anyone wanted to be a cardiologist, in ten years' time, you would have to be sure that you respected some of the rules of this extreme medical plan that the government was going to take over for all Americans.	No
9564	That's math that doesn't add up.	No
12725	I didn't judge who should be the Secretary of State.	No
12394	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	No
26667	Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	No
19720	Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.	No
10155	Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	Yes
32294	It is also important that I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with Muslim majority nations.	No
14719	I know we can do better.	No
27799	If we take your advice on how we change our tax codes so that businesses that earn profits abroad do not pay U.S. taxes compared to businesses that pay taxes here.	No
668	Look at the INF treaty.	No
8858	The government does not get tax now from businesses there because they are not there, or people who are on welfare rather than working.	Yes
12376	Well, we all make mistakes.	No
3782	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	No
8485	The reason why these particular bills in these various areas that were mentioned were not adopted was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	No
8749	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.	Yes
8477	Of course, my opinions are a little different.	No
29122	I hope I can win your vote on November 8.	No
19723	This could reduce Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten Kuwait and its other neighbours again.	No
24717	So keep the line on social security and put a ceiling on the growth of the mandatory program.	No
23445	Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	Yes
1188	If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	No
14062	This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	No
23098	He wanted to give people rights.	No
23142	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all frivolous trials that cost our government $28 billion a year.	Yes
27818	My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	No
24167	There are 200,000 unemployed in California only because we cut the defense without planning to recycle them and reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	Yes
33853	"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."	Yes
1109	Over the past two weeks, I have had the opportunity to speak to two men who have visited the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	No
1253	This is a 30 percent reduction in the federal government's contribution to education in just eight years.	Yes
22457	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	No
27086	I think Assad has to leave.	No
6013	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have our own supply.	No
17471	Now it's a sin if you take a human life.	No
33222	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	No
22140	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	Yes
17846	The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	No
12131	49th for women with health care and 50th for families with health care.	Yes
22963	I just think I can do it much more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing this is intelligence.	No
12654	I am not as confident as it is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	No
23248	And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	Yes
20993	On the international financial crises that have occurred, my friend Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of the Treasury is here, he is a close adviser to me and a great friend in all respects.	No
17698	They want these young people to have a chance to get a job and the rest.	No
6936	Our health care system is the envy of the world because we believe that decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the national capital.	No
12585	Does our relative strength increase?	No
20458	I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	No
1171	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	No
28874	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	No
8163	I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	No
34246	It's so sad to see what happened.	No
32479	We are getting rid of the regulations that go hand in hand with lower taxes.	No
30309	Words matter when you run for president.	No
12908	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	Yes
25824	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
13816	Is the guy who's not at work better?	No
21444	And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 a.m. to the east, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt, so we're going to come straight to that one.	No
28718	And recently, the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies warned parents that the equipment is inappropriate for children, and then they turned around behind the parents' backs and announced the same adult material directly to the children.	Yes
873	I try to meet them and insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stay very long.	No
19975	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	No
32882	...but we thought we could improve the country.	No
15589	There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	No
32186	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	No
22621	And that was the serious threat.	No
19848	I supported all the education programs.	Yes
173	It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.	No
20852	And so does Michael Feinberg.	No
12635	More Asian countries have voted against us on this issue than with us.	Yes
1844	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	Yes
19250	He doesn't fix it for ten years.	Yes
9548	And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.	Yes
1572	I served an a hospital authority.	No
33823	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	No
8038	Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.	No
14971	The size of the government in California increased only one sixth of what it increased as a proportion of the population in Georgia.	Yes
444	And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	No
25328	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	Yes
19117	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	No
32727	Why can't they do it quietly?	No
25900	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	No
25147	Joint leaders urged the President not to put our troops in this barracks because they were indefensible.	Yes
27209	And our army, we must strengthen our army in the long term.	No
8687	But I don't see where it's inflationist to have people keep more of their income and spend it, and it's not inflationist for the government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things he wants to spend on.	No
16394	And by that I want to have day care centres where families, parents, have control.	No
1547	We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.	No
7338	This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	Yes
6270	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	No
4350	"But in the case of missile defence, Senator Obama said that it must be, that is, ""proven""."	Yes
22087	What do we have to do?	No
17176	Yeah, and I'm up to the problem with a fair answer.	No
1394	Okay, I thought I answered that by saying it would be on the basis of merit.	No
1407	I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.	No
2979	The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	Yes
20107	I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.	Yes
23820	I think the main thing that separates me is that five and a half million people gathered alone and put me on the vote.	Yes
28403	And I want to go back to something I said before.	No
15202	And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	No
17093	This year, the deficit narrowed by $21 billion compared to last year, mainly due to the increase in government revenues without increasing tax rates.	Yes
13999	He said that the economy of trickle-down was the voodoo economy; now he is the greatest practitioner.	Yes
26342	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	No
171	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.	No
18789	And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	No
21974	When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	No
473	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	No
28933	I don't think that's right.	No
7842	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	Yes
22974	Ladies and gentlemen, this is his tax plan.	No
16910	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	No
26351	That is how it should work, give more power to the states and return to the citizens to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	No
20665	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	No
31980	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	No
19653	They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	No
25037	I understand exactly what the Soviets are doing, but it is also part of the national force.	No
27342	I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	No
27803	We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	No
14073	And maybe you need someone who understands when you have your chosen pocket.	No
661	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	No
23351	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	No
29144	And we can't allow it anymore.	No
2326	Governor Romney said he wanted to repeal Dodd-Frank.	Yes
10542	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	Yes
11227	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	No
32889	You're looking at the violence in downtown Chicago, you're looking at Washington, D.C.	No
15521	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	Yes
32650	You were in full contact with the White House, and perhaps, unfortunately, Obama probably still listened to you.	No
21240	I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	No
3424	I cannot think of a more important moment for us to talk about the future of the country.	No
13006	It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	No
12513	I traveled to 48 of the fifty states and in my travels I learned what the people of the United States are thinking.	No
20480	And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	No
1093	It is for the competent authorities who have the control of these tapes to make this decision.	No
22394	How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	No
21336	And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	No
17534	It was a big failure.	No
14061	But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	Yes
24311	And the soldiers who loved him better than before.	No
34250	It has also aligned itself with Iran, which we have made very powerful.	Yes
8120	Are we as strong as we should be?	No
18642	So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	No
14390	I'll do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	No
21973	When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	No
16670	We will not wait another year or two, as Governor Carter points out.	No
19711	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	No
12848	I think that we should not go to the summit until there is reason to believe that a spirit meeting can be achieved either on Berlin, on outer space or on general disarmament, including nuclear testing.	No
25462	And B - 1 must also be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet B - 1.	Yes
8305	So I think the case of government intervention is good.	No
1877	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	No
5855	And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	No
8960	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	No
21507	I'm not interested in his character.	No
32171	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	Yes
8912	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell voters in this country exactly what I think it will cost, because I believe that too often, in past elections, politicians have simply promised people things they cannot deliver.	No
19365	But I want to go back to 1965.	No
11249	We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	No
17142	And there are other ways to press this budget without constantly attacking our elders and the most vulnerable in American life.	No
20262	I'm taking the floor.	No
25118	Our position happened to be at the airport.	No
3146	He has been in office for two years, and there has been absolutely no progress towards a new SALT agreement.	Yes
25846	Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	No
11439	So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	No
6237	The last point I would like to raise on the issue of abortion.	No
15423	I consider myself in the general trend of the bipartite list of presidents who served before me.	No
25299	And that is why the failure of this administration to deal effectively and in good faith with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with other nations in trying to find a peaceful solution to the dispute in Central America has undermined our ability to deal effectively diplomatically in this area as well.	Yes
21678	Do you want jobs in the inner city?	No
5511	First of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for welcoming us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again and thank you, Bob.	No
13912	We must proceed very carefully on this.	No
19181	In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.	Yes
19993	It's about my vision for America and his liberal vision for America.	No
24372	To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	No
8557	And I think we have a powerful country.	No
13419	The man-t who cultivates tomatoes - it costs less for these tomatoes than it does for the label on the box.	Yes
26321	It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	No
29871	And I've met some of the greatest people I've ever met in these communities.	No
9045	We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	No
7889	I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	No
29690	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	No
12098	Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	No
20005	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	No
23612	Religion has been an integral part of my life.	No
8241	And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	No
25414	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	No
8441	The question before the Senate was that the money would be given to the State.	No
6333	In the third year, several times, children who were in the preschool program are no better off than others.	Yes
24281	So we have two that I'd put as number one.	No
30145	And you're going to stop them?	No
6097	And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.	No
29777	Property crimes are down 40%.	Yes
33328	Now I want to build the wall.	No
13625	But not by increasing taxes.	No
3069	We are no longer respected in an opposition vote at the United Nations or in any other international council, we have the chance to get 20 per cent of the other nations to vote with us.	Yes
8506	It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	No
14134	So the answer is I could do it.	No
26387	So we talk about all these new jobs.	No
19599	We shouldn't do any favors for North Korea.	No
11685	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	No
13594	Middle-class people will have their fair share of change to make, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of being constantly re-educated.	No
22036	See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.	Yes
18110	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	No
8412	I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	No
886	I very much doubt that Mr Bush's selection for the United States Vice-President meets this criterion.	No
32076	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	No
11014	That is a fundamental difference I have with Senator McCain.	No
30446	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	No
26528	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	No
16253	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	No
20040	And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	No
26195	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw the free tax to pay the cost of education and everything is paid.	No
6742	I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.	No
8225	Again, let me point out that Senator Kennedy and I do not disagree with the objectives.	No
22268	You had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	No
33884	But he also chased a disabled journalist, mocked him and mimed him on national television.	Yes
12040	I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	No
5938	You know, I think it's -- it's going to be up to the American people.	No
19350	That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.	No
7639	It seems to me to be critical that he is still wrong on his part.	No
25681	Let me first give you a sports update.	No
27788	I was with a company that manufactures valves and -- and the processing industries and they said, we were -- we had valves that were broken and we had to fix them under warranty and we looked at them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	No
25597	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	No
21010	But they worked hard eight years ago.	No
11885	Is anybody being discriminated against?	No
17811	But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	No
8240	It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	No
15705	I think we can save money with this very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you understand competitive strategies.	No
5925	She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	Yes
25380	We'll even give it to you.	No
13940	No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	No
17354	And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	No
25967	Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	No
12893	As far as the balance of the world is concerned, I obviously do not have as much time as Senator Kennedy.	No
6625	No, education is how to help the person who lost a job.	No
22307	I just want to mention if I could...	No
1287	I believe that this administration has been more receptive and that we have applied the law to the letter, and I am proud of the file.	No
15229	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up great opportunities for the Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in perspective because of the new energy policy that we have implemented.	No
25141	The red light turned on.	No
29568	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	No
22747	Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	No
24563	Our differences are our strengths.	No
12906	Let me stress that he voted in favour of the 1955 resolution which gave the President the power to use US forces to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	Yes
16658	But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	Yes
19813	I didn't favor him when he came in, started.	No
33307	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	Yes
27977	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
34008	You should have changed the law.	No
33200	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	Yes
15882	I think the American people would like that.	No
19791	And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.	No
1593	Last year, the budget was more than ever unbalanced in our country's history - $65 billion - mainly because our people are not at work.	Yes
345	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	No
4227	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and he said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	No
11735	That's really about all we can do.	No
18731	And so if Kim Jong He decides again not to honor an agreement, he does not only injustice to America, he would also do injustice to China.	No
27440	So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	Yes
22480	They will not be resolved overnight.	No
457	I haven't sorted out the penalties.	No
22442	Congress... they're all good people.	No
15540	The vice president talks about national security.	No
25270	This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	No
33216	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of little ones are hurting themselves, even killing people with weapons, because, unfortunately, all those who have loaded weapons in their home do not take appropriate precautions.	Yes
17323	Let us take the example that the President cites.	No
31852	Actually, I agree with that.	No
8426	But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	No
2695	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	No
741	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and blackmail us.	No
1099	I don't have an answer.	No
10708	First of all, I proposed a long time ago that we should look at every agency and every government bureaucracy.	Yes
33803	And frankly, when you look at his real record, take a look at Syria.	No
24785	I don't make bones on that.	No
30446	So I hope that you will vote as if your future depended on it, because I think that is the case.	No
27255	We have simply not taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to us in Latin America.	No
20916	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there are the largest generation of students of all time.	Yes
10729	"And President Bush did smart things from the beginning, but one of the missed opportunities was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go and shop."""	No
31904	And I'll tell you, I'll take care of ISIS.	No
23830	But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	No
14680	Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	No
20893	Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?	No
10072	And the suggestion that anyone in my team, if the Secretary of State, our United Nations.	No
12910	Now, I mean, Senator Kennedy must be consistent here.	No
19945	It is embarrassing for Senator Dole, but the truth is that I have reduced the size of the government more than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
23153	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	No
3955	So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	No
19688	So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	No
112	Thirdly, we need to lower interest rates, and we will develop a sound plan with Congress to reduce that deficit.	No
25382	I think it would be the best use of a defensive weapon.	No
28310	We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	No
14636	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	No
10838	I have fought excess spending.	Yes
29102	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	No
19523	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence in the world with the largest increase in trade with the largest number of trade agreements in history, and that is one of the reasons why America is once again number one in automotive production.	Yes
24435	I agree that we cannot engage land forces to participate in the Bosnian quagmire or Somali tribal wars.	No
33285	And I can tell you that the government has no business in the decisions women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	No
25299	And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	Yes
18554	But I have a plan to do it.	No
20376	It is clear that you can go to the website and watch.	No
30186	And that's exactly what it's done.	No
29616	We owe 20 trillion dollars, and we're in trouble.	Yes
18944	This will mean that China is no longer involved in the conviction, with us, that Kim Jong He is getting rid of his weapons.	No
22020	That's the election.	No
31977	It was a conversation in the locker room.	No
19493	I mean, it seemed to me at the time that the ban on assault weapons was not effective.	No
30129	And they're gonna do it.	No
28718	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	Yes
25208	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	No
11873	And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	No
19531	They didn't get the tanks of this administration because we were under national construction.	Yes
21363	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan indicates that he will reduce the deficit in five years' time, but that he will make unemployment bad for another four years.	Yes
8449	This is completely wrong, quite by mistake, and it is a fact that over the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropriations requested by more than ten billion dollars.	Yes
25530	National security and human rights must go together.	No
26660	We sell Japanese rice from California for the first time.	Yes
28471	I've been working on this long and hard.	No
30407	Where did you find this?	No
12060	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	No
28553	But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	No
3639	Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	Yes
27632	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	No
32568	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	No
10020	I know these folks and I know their families.	No
30229	No, they were taunting us.	No
33460	They have no idea where they come from.	Yes
4153	We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	Yes
21443	As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	No
23519	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	No
8903	And why did they lose their industry?	No
14064	We won't make planes in this country in 10 years if we let things go like this.	No
1732	My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	No
14245	Now, I think that's going back to where we started.	No
24928	I ordered an investigation.	Yes
21683	And, among other things, I would say, I agree, here in this Senate committee, to the Speaker who is looking forward to passing this bill, to the Speaker who is anxious, I would say rather than shouting at each other, why not find out where we are separated, try to get together, get the bill passed and give people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	No
3104	In 1975, he wanted to cut the budget by $15 billion.	Yes
32891	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has a huge hatred in her heart.	No
23764	And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	No
4138	I'm not going to set the schedule for White House visitors until I'm president of the United States.	No
9963	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	No
16137	There are we certainly ought to be able to	No
29562	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	No
20702	Whether or not decisions are made based on sound principles or whether or not surveys and focus groups are used to determine how to proceed.	No
28520	The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.	No
34121	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	No
10084	I want to make sure we get it for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack on Benghazi an act of terror.	Yes
9812	It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	Yes
33663	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	No
20745	Now, for every dollar I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 for a tax reduction for the richest 1%.	Yes
28295	Traditionally, if you have been involved in such a campaign, you know that parents with children in school are the ones who reveal themselves and vote.	No
6529	It's not working for the American family.	No
13393	I am not satisfied even if there was no communism in the world, but especially when we are in the kind of race in which we are, we must see that America grows as fast as we can, provided we grow healthy.	No
1748	So the question is how to get them back on track.	No
30265	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	No
11645	In fact, we have sent troops to Rwanda to assist humanitarian relief.	Yes
22319	I'll mention only one, the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	No
6326	Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.	No
4028	And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	No
19951	Their budget has weakened our support for education.	No
7934	I have spoken in every speech about the fact that these times will be very difficult in the 1960s and that we will have to assume our responsibilities as citizens.	No
22430	I hope I'm that person.	No
32286	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	No
19188	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better than it was four years ago.	No
17188	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	No
27262	And that's where we're going right now unless we end this spending and borrow money.	No
14062	This agreement is terribly destructive for the American air industry.	No
18623	Never wanted to commit troops.	No
20108	The deficit was bigger than I thought.	No
21139	We have to think differently about the issue.	No
6911	I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	No
20836	That's my vision of public education all over America.	No
16711	Now we've increased that amount by 25%.	Yes
24836	You can't be on one side like that and on the other.	No
1118	I will take the strongest possible action outside the actual military action of our own troops, but I doubt that this is a possibility.	No
22787	Let me address this issue, but also talk about the weapons that the President has just spoken of, because each part of the President's answer has just promised you more of the same over the next four years.	No
17289	That is why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	No
29586	That was more than a mistake.	No
28783	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	No
17744	I'm going to use my time a little differently.	No
12016	But I said if you want a trigger lock to secure your weapon, come get one for free.	No
26230	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	No
14178	We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	No
2377	Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.	No
27492	There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	No
23084	I've been to Washington, D.C., three and a half years and I've led Congress to reform health insurance so that our seniors have a modern health care system.	Yes
16641	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	Yes
21591	This year, we have passed the most ambitious bill in the country's history since Eisenhower launched interstate highways -- $150 billion to improve infrastructure.	Yes
12988	We have built more houses in the last seven years than in any administration and thirty percent more than in the previous administration.	Yes
33662	I have said many times throughout this campaign: I will not increase taxes for anyone who earns $250,000 or less.	Yes
13456	I don't like it because I want to make a lot of oilmen rich, but because I want to make America rich.	No
15665	Thank God I was in the camp with Jimmy Baker and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks against me out of this democratic convention.	No
24156	We've given away whole industries.	Yes
23456	Ladies and gentlemen, it's not true what he said.	Yes
8846	that the federal grants that come with.	No
1343	The record does not prove that such legislation or action by a municipal council is effective.	Yes
19630	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, as if he did a lot of things.	No
28849	Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of taking positive action?	No
19156	If you made $25,000 as an initial proposal, you increased your social security taxes.	Yes
26908	With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	No
22337	They know what it's like not to have family leave or child care.	No
26065	I do not think we should grant social benefits to illegal immigrants.	No
32437	I have no loans from Russia.	Yes
26581	It'll help everything.	No
27292	Well, I need to talk for a while...	No
20101	When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.	Yes
5668	That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.	No
29568	And the financial statements don't give you the tax rate.	No
27642	And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	No
14566	If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	No
12526	And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	Yes
30154	Just -- do you want to hear...	No
23755	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	No
6342	Sarah Palin knows better than most.	No
19032	And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	No
7144	Women work 76 cents on the dollar for the same job as men.	Yes
16121	But everyone knew that those of us who voted against the COLA freeze did it, we did it forcefully.	No
15593	That's not what we're going to do.	No
22110	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	No
2743	There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.	No
15517	He had two terms in the Senate for his second term.	Yes
2147	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	Yes
10052	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	No
11999	I think these measures are important.	No
9488	Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	No
12453	I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	Yes
23679	He shouldn't have made that decision.	No
1812	So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	No
13468	I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.	No
27646	We then began to strengthen the Afghan forces.	No
7755	They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.	Yes
32855	To go back to the very, very first question.	No
15776	And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	No
26512	Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	No
2176	But the idea of reducing 716 billion dollars in Medicare to balance Obamacare's extra cost is, in my opinion, a mistake.	No
18594	The way to ensure that we succeed is to send coherent and sound messages to the Iraqi people, according to which when we give our word, we will keep our word, stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	No
23208	And today, it's less than 1%, because we're working together to try to control this deficit.	Yes
18468	I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	No
29223	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	Yes
24201	Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	No
27296	I'm so proud of the state that I've had the chance to be governor of.	No
21762	For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	Yes
21315	If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	No
14044	And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.	No
10728	You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	No
8189	Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?	No
8538	Again, the question is not one of the objectives - we are in favour of these objectives - that is one of the means.	No
9514	We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	Yes
14438	Come on, it's not leadership.	No
23174	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	No
20833	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for each level.	No
3657	Who was the person who tried to keep spending control?	No
20162	And I would tell those I know that there are more young people who are experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has increased.	Yes
633	In fact, he said that he was not and should not be subjected to partisan demagogy because it was too important for the United States or the world.	No
22440	Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	No
11034	And I am convinced that my case, by returning to my opposition to sending the Marines to Lebanon, in support of our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the First Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I am -- a case that I am prepared to maintain.	Yes
15119	Secondly, we have all committed ourselves, like all my predecessors in the Oval Office, not to allow the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or any other nation that does not currently have such weapons or explosive capabilities.	No
26254	Discrimination should be punished, but there should be equal opportunities.	No
21543	This is not specific in terms of programme.	No
32443	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
29963	Maybe I'm trying to save money.	No
16912	It's not a question of Republicans and Democrats.	No
27678	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people of Pakistan to try to help them move on to a more responsible path than they are on.	No
26369	He said it was a mistake.	No
3526	We haven't been paying attention to them.	No
30309	Words are important when you come to the presidency.	No
28567	Let me tell you my position.	No
29411	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would appreciate it too much.	No
22138	I now suggest that our number one concern is red ink and our country and we must put our people back to work so that we can afford to do those things we want to do in Russia.	No
24746	And you have to have cost controls, yes.	No
1972	And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.	Yes
25909	He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	No
16588	When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	Yes
17815	This economy is beginning to collapse.	No
18457	Osama bin Laden will not determine how we defend ourselves.	No
12450	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	No
13759	Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	No
9509	I want to get America's economy going again.	No
25218	And we know what happened.	No
6578	I'm going to change that.	No
150	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	No
19290	It is a $550 billion tax system that will cause a big gap in the deficit that will increase interest rates and slow the economy and make more people pay for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans and small business loans.	Yes
16808	And we have never had a president since the war between states that vetoed other bills.	Yes
27123	It's a time -- it should have been a time for American leadership.	No
23693	I did the right decision.	No
10474	You know that the value at home of pensioners continues to decline and that people are no longer able to pay their mortgages.	Yes
25042	I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.	No
33268	I have met women who, towards the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news that can be obtained, that their health is in danger if they continue to carry in time or that something terrible has happened or has just been discovered about pregnancy.	No
11050	We spend $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	Yes
19818	I've reached out to people all my life.	No
27125	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	No
12808	But I am very concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	No
7958	I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	No
4167	By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	No
26576	We can invite all the candidates.	No
17680	I don't care about these corporate areas, let's try them, but not as a substitute for others.	No
17861	By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	Yes
14720	It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	No
2377	Number three, he's setting up an unelected council that's going to tell people what kind of treatments they can have.	No
27276	We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	No
16832	Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	No
17491	I don't think so, and I think it's going exactly in the wrong direction.	No
9035	And for the state to intervene in this decision, in any form and with any justification whatsoever, so that the state may try to take over in this situation, and by decree, order what the individual must do, and substitute himself for the conscience of that individual, for his right to consult his rabbi, his minister, his priest, his doctor - any other adviser of his choice - I think that goes beyond what we ever want to see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the first amendment: if we really believe in the freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	No
8666	That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	No
751	It was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr Bush and others made and that should never be made again.	No
6563	We don't give this for nothing.	No
1793	When you add up all the gaps and deductions that high-income individuals can -- by taking advantage of them all, you can't pay $5 trillion in tax reductions and $2 trillion in additional military expenditures.	Yes
32910	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	No
22135	We have to have money to do this.	No
22691	Senator Richard Lugar, Republican Chairman of the External Relations Committee, said that the treatment of reconstruction assistance in Iraq by this administration was incompetent.	No
18807	It is a moral responsibility for us and for the world.	No
25245	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	No
24480	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	No
27214	We must therefore make decisions based on uncertainty, which means a strong army.	No
34445	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	No
8406	This, however, increases taxes for those who pay social security.	No
4227	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	No
22493	It is time to give priority to the American people, to invest and to develop this economy.	No
15912	Who are we to say, well, in some circumstances, it is not serious, but in other circumstances it is not?	No
15276	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	Yes
27	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as if it were a little humorous incident.	No
7513	I ask you for your help.	No
14704	I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	No
26970	You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	Yes
1787	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	Yes
3281	On July 12 of this year, we gave full authorization for the publication of this report.	Yes
10032	I said I would end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	Yes
27170	But it's an honor that we have it.	No
7439	Rather divided in the 2000 election.	No
11251	Energy will play a key role in relations with Russia.	No
31977	That was locker room talk.	No
8875	And until we can start to recreate the basic infrastructure of the big cities of America, especially in the upper Midwest and the northeast, they will simply not provide the kind of economic climate that will allow them to maintain the industry, to maintain the type of solid industrial base they need, so that they can provide jobs.	No
26774	But we're not there yet.	No
653	Yeah, I think it's good to do business with them.	No
13849	We took them out, we took them home.	Yes
23644	I also think that we should continue to have a good law on adoption as an alternative to abortion.	No
22210	Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	No
16089	And I voted as he did three months ago at a conference of national governors.	No
7679	What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	No
610	I mean, there are a lot of them that I am opposed to, but what I am not going to do, when we negotiate with the Soviet Union, sitting by talking to Mr Gorbachev about how we get a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I am not going to give a few aces that I have this very difficult card game.	No
11172	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I even hate going.	No
28040	He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	No
5668	That's not how you cut -- you cut all the pork.	No
19607	And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.	No
27888	Governor Romney, you keep trying, you know the history of the airbrush here.	No
13917	And I have a long history of doing this.	Yes
14409	Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	No
19186	Well, I guess some of them might be better.	No
32985	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	No
6571	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	No
12071	And I agree with a lot of other things the governor said.	No
18564	"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	No
17112	In fact, in constant dollars, on the inside side of the budget, there has been no increase in spending in the four years we spent here.	Yes
6799	I think it's important to promote a culture of life.	No
1059	But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	No
6537	And there is no system.	No
1751	These are the cornerstones of my plan.	No
10878	But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.	No
28296	It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	Yes
11345	Senator Obama had the opening.	No
25786	We're not talking about it.	No
17699	I think the business world wants to get involved.	No
11515	But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.	No
14458	Well, I don't think it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not healthy.	No
25117	We were here for the best part of a year.	No
18302	And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.	Yes
25689	Sometimes the viewpoints have been distorted.	No
13011	There were eleven dictators when we came to power in 1953 in Latin America.	Yes
28471	I've worked on that long and hard.	No
25011	Our neighbours in America are vital to us.	No
7663	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	No
26405	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	No
9016	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	No
21765	And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	No
25068	Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	No
5939	I think that, of course, she is a competent politician who, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	No
3914	But in 16 months, we should be able to reduce our combat troops, provide relief to military families and our troops, and strengthen our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill Bin Laden and crush Al-Qaeda.	No
27057	What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	Yes
17402	The crime has declined in the last two years, for the first time in many decades, or since we kept records, two consecutive years, and last year it has decreased the largest drop in the crime we've had.	Yes
21855	If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	No
6643	They added only a little back this year because it's an election year.	Yes
23177	We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	Yes
8129	I am not satisfied when the Soviet Union is twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	Yes
14234	You've got to go to the people.	No
20554	I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
946	And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	No
119	He seems to want to spend a lot of money on almost every weapon system; he says he's against the new taxes, although he broke that commitment at least several times last year I know; he wants to give the richest taxpayers in this country a five-year tax reduction of $40 billion.	Yes
14468	The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	Yes
17577	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	No
16285	And the reason we got it is because they now consider us unwilling to make the same kind of unilateral cuts that have been requested and go for the discredited freeze.	No
26072	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	No
9986	His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.	Yes
18286	Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	No
2099	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years of breaks, in the solar and wind, in Solyndra, Fisker, Tester and Ener1.	Yes
16582	But I hope to have a full responsibility on my shoulders to help establish a fair criminal justice system and also to put an end to the division that occurred in our country following the Vietnam war.	No
899	I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	No
19197	One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	No
503	So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	No
2485	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	Yes
4041	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	No
2406	... the irony is that we have seen this model work very well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney has done a good thing, working with the democrats in the state to put in place what is essentially the same model and therefore people are covered there.	Yes
2327	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	No
24632	We're lucky she's running the commission.	No
11926	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	No
4327	We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	No
400	We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	No
14469	These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.	No
8587	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican senators, as I have supported - is the one that provides for all those over 65 years of age who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	Yes
22918	And they're over there, not over here.	No
3610	Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.	Yes
1575	Our tax structure is a shame, it needs to be reformed.	No
23040	And we're doing just that.	No
3082	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	No
24507	So we're still in the fight.	No
18660	We would have had the UN inspectors.	No
20085	Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	Yes
22915	It hurts the middle class.	No
17192	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	No
12414	It's up to people to take care of it, isn't it?	Yes
28538	But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	No
6799	I think it is important to promote a culture of life.	No
8507	The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	Yes
3213	And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	No
17769	And that's the way it should be.	No
3550	We spent $3 million studying bears DNA in Montana.	Yes
20014	Let's go back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you're a little more specific, but I think the president could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of forgiveness.	No
24379	And I got up with these people, and I understand what you need to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we want.	No
15834	And I'm telling Barbara, you know, we've always kept the family like an oasis for us.	No
1055	I don't know how to deal with it exactly.	No
729	We have set funding levels and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	No
24283	First, we have to have the money to be able to pay the defense, and we have to make it here.	No
25630	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	No
21646	There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the city centre.	No
13659	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	Yes
12740	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	No
14691	Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.	Yes
24622	To go to a Catholic mass in a beautiful New York cathedral under the cause of AIDS aid and start throwing condoms around the mass, I'm sorry, I think that makes the cause go back.	No
62	This means that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership must reflect these values ourselves.	No
1210	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	Yes
2046	I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	No
20568	If you look at the history of a trial judge's decisions, you may have a good idea how they will interpret the questions.	No
32563	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	No
19381	So, after President Gingrich and Senator Dole took over from Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman who unfortunately passed away a few days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	No
32129	I'd like to know, Anderson, why don't you raise the e-mails?	No
9328	There were a lot of oil companies.	No
11579	If I think it's in our country's strategic interest, I'm going to hire troops.	No
27165	We want a peaceful planet.	No
22822	The president did not do what was necessary.	No
11743	We have had some disagreements on this.	No
13679	And I said I was making a mistake.	No
9403	So I get the last question -- last answer --	No
12904	He supported the President's position.	Yes
13712	Over the past five years, our income has increased faster than the national average.	Yes
12724	There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.	No
8576	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	Yes
17025	Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	No
30419	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	No
3337	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a complete and complete account of our disappearance in action, I will never go with Vietnam's admission to the United Nations.	Yes
24273	We are sitting on a time bomb, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we should take it back under control.	No
33686	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	No
23329	I mean, they're not makeup figures.	Yes
9967	I'm not looking at my pension.	No
18408	So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.	No
34121	I've read about going after Mosul for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	No
11057	It didn't work out for America.	No
17185	I believe that the way I approach the Presidency is what is necessary, because my whole life has been the way I have sought to lead.	No
33691	That is not going to work.	No
2393	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	No
13520	Four, in the votes at the United Nations, in particular the vote on Red China last Saturday, we received support for the position we had taken from only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been linked to us for more than a century, and the other, the Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	Yes
29941	He therefore has a long tradition of racist behaviour.	Yes
32728	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	No
19195	That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.	Yes
19218	It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	No
6880	Once again, the president is misleading America.	No
26456	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	No
20480	And we can do this in an environmentally friendly way.	No
1873	But businesses in the last three percent of businesses employ half -- half of all people working in small businesses.	Yes
6500	I don't really think about him.	No
33541	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	No
25566	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so no one will get hurt.	No
23899	I think the American people should be the judge.	No
24826	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	No
27593	In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	Yes
17267	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	No
29309	When I was Secretary of State, we actually increased U.S. exports by 30 percent around the world.	Yes
34053	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	No
18068	My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	Yes
3660	Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	No
11150	I want to be very clear about what I said.	No
16064	And these are the standards I will use to designate people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	No
23314	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, together, for a commission that fills the company's donation gaps.	Yes
26179	6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	Yes
13835	The thing I'm in this race for is to hit the American people on the shoulder and tell each of you, repair while we're still relatively strong.	No
193	So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	No
642	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	No
148	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	No
20230	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	Yes
30207	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first NATO.	No
24980	I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.	No
23594	I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.	No
2892	I've talked to them and I've listened.	No
14449	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	No
2869	As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.	Yes
24029	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	No
10139	And you're asking how -- how are we going to do that?	No
10159	But it was one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society that occurred during this administration.	No
33423	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	No
13841	I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	No
17158	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	Yes
3261	We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	No
16380	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	No
31843	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	No
19882	You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	No
22823	There hasn't been enough nation.	No
23730	He wants your kids to pay for it.	No
24633	Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	No
30119	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	Yes
7883	Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	No
24835	You have to make tough calls.	No
6251	Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	No
7886	Let me make my position.	No
23001	This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	No
12198	That we spent -- the highest 1% receive 223, compared to 445 billion new spending.	Yes
23684	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	No
26911	In Libya, we see an attack apparently by, I think, now, by terrorists of a kind against, against our people there, four dead people.	Yes
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
28781	What I was interested in was that we could work together.	No
19748	Our allies know -- they're not sure what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do, what we're going to do.	No
24507	So we're still in the fight.	No
26570	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where a vote has made a difference.	No
22365	I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	No
11992	If we could get an agreement on that, maybe they could spend it in the last days of this Congress.	No
6265	So we've got to get our education system right.	No
20115	Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	No
22129	Russia is still very unstable; it could return to square one, and worse still.	No
21857	I think it's a good program.	No
15241	The other thing is that we only rented - started exploring - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where we believe, by everyone familiar with this fuel and this energy source, that there are still vast supplies to find.	Yes
14929	But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	Yes
859	I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.	No
27583	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	No
22303	We have to try it.	No
13752	And if they can't do it, if Congress can't do it, then let them do it in general.	No
10185	We're starting to see gains in math and science.	Yes
14277	We destroyed the 4th largest army, and we did it through the leadership.	Yes
21820	The key is to control costs and maintain quality.	No
19402	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	No
17326	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	No
1930	I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.	No
29791	Right now -- and that's something Donald has supported, with the weapons lobby -- right now, we have too many military-style weapons on the street.	Yes
22478	I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.	No
23946	Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.	No
23439	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, to have an energy plan.	No
33170	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	No
15428	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	No
26637	Stop some of these crazy litigations and let people work in America.	No
18205	There are many good people who work hard.	No
6117	Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.	No
14610	So I'm the only one who's not tarnished at that time?	No
22451	Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	No
8494	Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.	No
16761	Even the supporters admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be made available.	Yes
28142	The governor talked about Medicare.	No
8550	About four hundred billion are the result of what individuals do.	Yes
20847	Let them go beyond the limits of the current structure to recruit teachers of the child-teaching type.	No
22924	Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	No
19237	And we will have time to deal with the long-term problems of baby boomers.	No
8035	I guess we were hoping when he made that speech that we wouldn't go into a war.	No
7084	And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	No
26753	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong or even immoral.	No
6251	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	No
19418	I do not think that this issue should be politicized because my file is clear and I do not believe that Senator Dole supports the use of drugs.	No
25291	I have also strongly recommended that this administration should do something that it has not done, that is, strengthen the enforcement of the law at the border, strengthen the officials of that government who deal with undocumented workers, and do so in a manner that is accountable and consistent with the United States Constitution.	No
7760	But we must get help from Congress to do so.	No
15024	We have seen an increase of 73% in the allocation of federal funding to improve education.	Yes
528	And yet, Mr Bush, I do not think we should expect companies to provide health insurance to their employees when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country, do so and pay more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care for people who are not insured, who have to go to this hospital.	Yes
21488	I get wound up because I feel strongly --	No
138	So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	No
12582	This is not a problem with Mr Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	Yes
22167	We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	No
12010	Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	No
23305	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, to have an energy plan, to have a reform of disputes.	No
1421	Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	Yes
1350	And the only way to do this is to adopt strong legislation so that once apprehended, charged, convicted, they are in prison and out of the street and do not use weapons in the commission of a crime.	No
21980	We went from the first to the twelfth in the world in wages.	Yes
20695	In fact, I know how important it is to ensure that our troops have the latest technology.	No
2557	We use something called Race to the Top.	No
32971	I think it would be a terrible mistake and bring us back upside down.	No
10251	The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.	Yes
3232	Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	Yes
27343	States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; they have shown that they can deliver these programs more cost-effectively.	Yes
24415	Use--work internationally to do so.	No
8362	There's no certain road to the presidency.	No
6469	The police are cut off from the streets of America because the president decided to cut off the PSC program.	Yes
14867	I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have been in a war that has ended in these eight years, which, of course, has changed military spending because of the transition from war to peace.	Yes
7802	But it is also extremely important to keep in mind that when you pay money without paying technical assistance to w- too, that you have a disastrous situation.	No
8479	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	Yes
15126	And although I have one last word here, I would like to correct a mistake of fact on the part of the President.	No
3478	We haven't seen the tongue yet.	No
13212	"For me, this concept is quite disgusting."""	No
12984	America is not motionless.	No
1902	But he has the first word in this segment.	No
8695	I'm saying that because I think this year we're going to send $90 billion from this country to pay for imported oil, even if that's the case.	No
28685	Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.	No
3586	It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.	No
6769	I completely respect their views.	No
17727	This deficit is ruining the long-term hopes of this economy.	No
15172	You have 99 other senators to correct this mistake, if that is a mistake.	No
15046	The president talks about government programs, and they have their place.	No
1538	I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.	No
27404	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	Yes
14841	It would be neat and plausible and wrong.	No
8759	So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	No
1348	That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	No
3240	Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	No
630	And I think I've had that.	No
12839	And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	No
3995	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	No
26486	That's just one tiny example.	No
1060	I think that's the opposite with President Ford's campaign, and, uh - I hope we can leave these questions in the next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, tax, government organization, suppression of secrecy, and things that are crucial to the American people.	No
3987	Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	No
19445	But let me remind you that my family suffered from drug abuse.	No
22957	When I can't tell you.	No
86	If he or some government officials are with or with people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or do not pursue this link in a way that allows us to cut it off and be an example for our children throughout the country.	No
26345	We had a better idea.	No
8806	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	Yes
20151	And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.	No
10074	That's not what we do.	No
6829	And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	Yes
1570	My past is different from his.	No
14087	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we're letting Europeans spend $25-40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	Yes
25836	But what's important is what we're gonna do now?	No
11280	And thank you, and thank you, my friend.	No
8697	And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	Yes
29374	I'm very proud of it.	No
26773	And we're all proud of it.	No
2869	In fact, I never advocated a $15 billion reduction in our defence budget.	Yes
21159	And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	No
21366	If you don't grow the economy, you can't do it.	No
8122	I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.	No
7724	The honourable senator has now referred the matter to the Committee on Public Procurement.	No
1693	That's not what I'm going to do.	No
23212	Thank you for your question.	No
22654	I would have fought to ensure that our troops had everyone to help them win the mission.	No
8976	In John, he doesn't realize it, he's never held such an executive position.	Yes
33462	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	No
11787	I want to help people help themselves, not let the government tell people what to do.	No
2242	We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	No
14056	The laws protect the U.S. taxpayer in this regard.	Yes
24293	We have to help them.	No
14235	I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.	No
21491	Let me begin by saying that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	No
25619	I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely.	No
27455	It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	No
16381	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	No
27947	Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.	No
16867	I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	Yes
18261	And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	Yes
13540	And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
21699	I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	No
14875	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	No
13539	We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.	No
33750	In fact, the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	Yes
29691	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	No
3825	We took the eye off the ball.	No
2557	We use something called Race to the Top.	No
11493	The sanctions are being violated.	Yes
17797	As for what we could do, and find in other savings cuts, no, we are not going to starve.	No
21747	And at this point, we can choose from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	No
18969	And I will continue to work with him over the next four years.	No
7985	Senator Kennedy must, as a candidate - like me as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we are wrong.	No
26030	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will save Medicare as we did social security.	No
23441	It encourages the use of renewable energy such as ethanol and biodiesel.	No
15748	How can we build a strong America, militarily, that is in debt on a mountain of debts?	No
15683	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	No
3574	Again, I don't want to go and come, but he...	No
13522	A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than with us.	Yes
5885	Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.	No
17608	"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	No
24342	"We said, ""Peace by force"", and it worked and the cold war is over."	No
15518	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	Yes
25062	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against tank M - 1, he was against bomber B - 1, he wanted to cut the wages of all the soldiers, he wanted to bring half of the American forces back to Europe.	Yes
6051	Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.	No
1970	And despite that, what we said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure that we did not fall into a great depression, but what we also said is, we have to make sure that we spare those things that do not help us grow.	No
11926	I would support the Orrin Hatch version, not the Senator Kennedy version.	No
3550	You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	Yes
23346	They're not being taken care of.	No
19797	As far as bridges are concerned, I want a bridge to the future.	No
11754	I think we should have foreign aid, but I don't think we should have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	No
15662	And then at this democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	No
26040	We need to reform it.	No
28552	I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.	No
23299	And I suspect, from his file, that he's going to raise taxes.	No
24854	What we need to do is empower people.	No
29390	So if you want to see in real time what the facts are, go see.	No
20955	You can see him in this campaign.	No
8601	I want to make sure it stays in this relationship.	No
3884	An election law just in the last few days.	No
22893	In Europe, we have gathered troops as if the Soviet Union existed and would invade Europe, but this time is over.	No
3976	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	Yes
8484	If the majority of Congressmen felt that these particular proposals were good questions - the majority of those who were democrats - why did they not adopt them and send them to the President to get a veto and have a problem?	No
12884	And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	No
26050	On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	Yes
405	When you talk to these bankers, did they discuss interest rates when your party controlled the White House?	No
27984	I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.	No
11408	One of the things I did in Texas was that I was able to form a good team of people.	No
8950	But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	Yes
29196	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	No
20425	The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	No
6719	You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
1315	I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	No
686	We cannot be strong militarily when we are on a mountain of debts that has been created over the last eight years.	No
1085	Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.	No
19636	It's a serious matter.	No
24074	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	Yes
22334	That lady said here, how did you get affected by the economy.	No
3268	The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	No
8009	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	No
20600	Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	No
22269	That's the only way we got him back.	No
16830	It costs our government about $1.4 billion a year.	Yes
34006	...because your donors and your special interests do the same thing as me, except more.	Yes
9418	-- we take advantage of our energy resources.	No
26903	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	No
32784	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	No
10266	All these changes in our tax code would make a difference.	No
19202	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	Yes
26263	Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.	No
1386	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	No
9661	When we talk about child care, and the money we provide.	No
6856	The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	Yes
354	A lot of them are mentally sick.	No
25154	And we were warned five days before the explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	Yes
26213	It'll help you in everything you're gonna do in the next few years.	No
8159	And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	No
20662	If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	No
31867	You say who's doing these things?	No
7418	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings like they're locked up today.	No
23295	It's growing, it says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	Yes
1283	What we do is that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities, where people with talent, black or any other minority can fully qualify.	No
8347	Sometimes my advice was followed.	No
18705	"I'm not sure what you mean, ""take the global test,"" you take preventive measures if you take a global test."	No
7905	I would be prepared, as President, to meet Mr Khrushchev or any other world leader if that would serve the cause of peace.	No
4191	They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	No
15168	He has never supported any of these arms control agreements — the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballist Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford — and he now wants to throw into the basket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between us and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a period of seven years, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
21454	Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.	No
10696	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	No
23772	We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.	No
2173	They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.	No
19149	I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	No
10782	The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	No
25576	And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.	No
18417	And in the meantime, North Korea has nuclear weapons.	Yes
3359	Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?	No
32363	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	No
16501	As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
23104	You can extract it from the Internet.	No
23450	You can't stop subcontracting, Charlie.	No
19820	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name some of my democrat friends.	No
28037	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	No
4271	And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.	No
13131	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	No
19507	Look at where we are today.	No
21563	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	No
9560	I was someone who had been running businesses for 25 years, and I was balancing the budget.	No
25195	The Soviet Union, to our great surprise - and not just mine - made it clear when we raised this point that they thought they had placed a greater dependence on land missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take all three.	Yes
16799	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	Yes
465	As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	Yes
11667	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I are starting to have differences.	No
18810	It was not my administration that imposed sanctions on Iran.	Yes
34259	We give them a lot of money, a lot of everything.	Yes
8674	fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	No
3284	Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	No
19859	Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	No
26936	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	No
19551	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East, we are better off than we were four years ago.	Yes
4077	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	No
15523	And so I have great confidence in him.	No
29236	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	Yes
16148	I think the agricultural bill he is criticizing was a good piece of legislation and a pending piece of legislation.	No
8755	It was the same government that, in 1920, told us that we had only oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us that we had only 15 years left.	Yes
20728	This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	No
33871	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	No
89	I asked and received the same presentation.	No
18038	And judgment is what we seek in the President of the United States of America.	No
24409	But when you're going to put someone else's son or daughter at war, I think you have to be a little careful and you have to be sure there's a military plan that can do it.	No
12835	If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	No
8745	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	No
10569	But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	No
11224	We must defend their membership of NATO.	No
17776	But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	No
21846	A big company can buy -- Ross has a good size business, has been very successful.	No
13406	And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	No
11724	Our military is meant to fight and win war.	No
33404	Either we have a border or we don't have it.	No
19606	Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	Yes
716	Maybe he'll tell us where he is tonight.	No
17505	And it's not that simple either.	No
24826	Mr Bush said very convincing things tonight that are not quite clear with the record.	No
12888	First of all, as far as Poland is concerned, when I spoke to Mr Gomulka, the current leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and in particular their own.	No
14410	The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.	No
32520	And I think it's unfortunate, but it happened, that since the Great Recession, the winnings have all gone to the top.	Yes
33632	Well, it's terribly hard to get them to pay when you have someone saying we think how big they are.	No
2924	He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	Yes
1852	Donald Trump is a small business.	No
10992	Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	No
13663	So my point of view is that the middle class is the -- they've suffered, Jim.	No
24266	We have a debt of four trillion dollars, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	Yes
5932	She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	No
24152	And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	No
15391	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	No
21023	I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.	No
26788	The future will be the best time in the history of this country if we succeed in defeating this division that ravages the rest of the world.	No
19990	But I think there are personal differences.	No
33991	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	Yes
19647	I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	No
8148	The argument has been used against every social legislation over the past 25 years.	No
11850	A jury found them guilty.	Yes
7615	U-2 flights were appropriate from the point of view of protecting our safety.	No
2146	And in Medicare, what we did was that we said, we're going to have to cut costs if we want to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do so, let's see where some of the money goes.	No
13216	I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	No
27038	What I have done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, first, to ensure that these countries support our efforts to combat terrorism.	No
13916	I do understand how to make things work.	No
27287	And the kind of budget proposals that you have put forward, when we do not ask you or me to pay a cent more in terms of deficit reduction, but instead, we reduce our support for education, which undermines our long-term competitiveness.	No
22373	Colin Powell will be on someone's ticket in four years.	No
13442	I think that all these elements should be examined in detail to ensure that no one will get tax relief; to ensure that no one moves away from paying the taxes they should pay.	No
22641	He can't come here and tell you that he created health care for the Americans because, what, we have 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them here in Missouri.	Yes
8246	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	No
26521	How many of you love him?	No
10442	It didn't work that way.	No
187	So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	No
26288	How do we pay for it?	No
13368	So, in my opinion, we would spend more money on this administration for education assistance, we would spend more money on housing, we would spend more money and I hope more wisely for defence than this administration has.	No
6535	All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.	Yes
19140	We have reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
19556	Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	No
5687	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four of President Bush's five budgets.	Yes
1768	And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.	No
14754	"The ""we"" is you and me."	No
13963	You know, Mr Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said that he should have the power to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	Yes
31926	And that's what I want to talk about.	No
25588	A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	No
1739	Middle-income Americans saw their income decrease by $4,300.	Yes
421	No, I don't think there is.	No
2021	And the reality is that they're not just rich people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	No
15026	It is very important for us that this be done with the full participation of minority citizens.	No
12593	He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	No
26019	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	Yes
26389	We will do so with a more aggressive trade policy.	No
17031	In the second century of our nation's history, our ancestors developed the most productive industrial nation in world history.	No
16252	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to solve the problems.	No
15758	But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	No
10736	It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.	Yes
13461	And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	No
5529	We have long-term challenges in this economy.	No
27586	They asked him, please fix the tension -- democratic senators -- please fix the tension...	No
17975	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	No
16618	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	No
20801	He decides who the right people are.	No
31993	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	No
25552	I'm not going to roll, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	No
4019	That was last August, a year ago.	No
18894	I did a lot of work on this.	No
29152	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies do.	Yes
34155	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
3233	Another point I want to raise is this one.	No
20908	Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.	No
31872	And this happens on a weekly basis.	No
26757	We still have some of that hatred inside us.	No
6602	And guess who usually ends up closing the tax gap?	No
3957	I'm not ready to cut aid to Pakistan.	No
21260	You are the ones who make car payments and mortgage payments and do well by your children.	No
22740	It was the right place.	No
30174	I was against the war.	Yes
32706	We have people who want to fight at the same time.	No
21494	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	No
22001	So at least we have time to work with her.	No
29515	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	Yes
30090	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, Minnesota, New Jersey.	No
1609	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	No
33754	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	No
16516	If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.	Yes
32423	That's the big difference between you and Abraham Lincoln.	No
11561	Now, there's more work to do.	No
19235	And now, with Senator Dole's risky $550 billion tax system, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says they can't pay without cutting Medicare more and social security too, he says.	Yes
16342	But there's no corner on that glare factor, believe me.	No
20089	I left on June 11 because I wanted the American people to know that I was ready to give up something.	No
26175	My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	No
11209	So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	No
7264	We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.	No
16515	Well, as a matter of fact there is.	No
16440	We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	No
6782	I will defend Roe v. Wade's right.	No
26367	Senator Dole led the opposition to it.	No
27236	We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	No
27231	We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.	Yes
23590	So you have a good sense of where he's going if he had to name someone.	No
13669	Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	Yes
26521	How many of you like it?	No
22610	After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	No
25382	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	No
33571	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	Yes
19859	Our schools are improving, and our schools can be even better with the right type of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	No
21384	I would like to have what 43 governors have -- the right to veto the line, so if Congress can't cut, and we have a Congress of reckless spending, let the President have a chance to do this by wiping things that are pork barrels or something like that.	Yes
1322	But among those you have appointed, I will not work actively for the passage of any of them.	No
20831	Here are the key ingredients.	No
24642	2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	No
19340	Second, Senator Dole has made rather harsh comments about special interest money, but I am not the one who is opposed to what we have tried to do to save the lives of children who were subjected to tobacco, who went to the tobacco producers and who boasted to defend the federal government when we tried to stop advertising, marketing and selling tobacco to children.	Yes
7837	I'm very familiar with it.	No
23917	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	No
1389	But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	Yes
23825	The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	No
20981	I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	No
6520	Help us give priority to those who need to be vaccinated against influenza, the elderly and young people.	No
15807	Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.	No
19800	We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	No
559	And yet some of our best presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	No
347	They gave him a lot of consciousness and a lot of work.	No
8711	And John spoke 15 years ago about the position he had.	No
15684	The Vice-President is complacent, thinks that we should stick to the status quo, do not think we should move forward, thinking that things are fine as they are.	No
23834	I want to bring that change to the American people.	No
19107	Let's move a million people from social assistance to work.	No
20070	That's what this is about.	No
7795	And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	No
26662	I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	Yes
1111	I have received a full report from these two distinguished countries... gentlemen.	Yes
17871	We have 543 at present.	Yes
24673	And the American people are ready to have a just and shared sacrifice.	No
33114	I disagree with his judgment in many cases.	No
7231	Nine of the 10 active army divisions are either in Iraq or Iraq or have returned from Iraq.	Yes
24625	We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	No
13627	So we have a big difference on this down theory.	No
25155	Terrorists have won every time.	No
19242	I thought it was a good program.	No
7492	And I think we're both very lucky.	No
461	And you see, yes, my position has changed.	No
9645	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	No
25614	Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	No
16623	For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	Yes
17560	And that is why I have proposed what I think is a fair and responsible proposal that helps protect those people who have not already benefited from relief or who have actually benefited from tax increases.	No
29644	I can only say that I am certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	No
12247	We have a very different outlook.	No
28910	Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.	No
13539	We could also look at other points that Senator Kennedy has appointed, but I will conclude by saying that in all this question of prestige, in the final analysis, it is if you defend what is right.	No
12890	And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.	Yes
11326	It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	No
15381	Governor Reagan and his new Republican party have deviated from this commitment - a very severe blow to the possibility for women to finally correct the discrimination under which they suffered.	No
27478	But our goal is to make Iran recognize that it must abandon its nuclear programme and comply with the United Nations resolutions that have been in place.	No
7158	Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	No
31978	I'm not proud of that.	No
19804	I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	No
7861	I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.	No
18715	I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	No
30076	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
15895	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	No
33756	We're going to have trade agreements that we're implementing.	No
11078	I will bring them home with victory and honour and it is a fundamental difference.	No
17560	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	No
391	It will require some funds, John.	No
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific progress.	Yes
28396	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	No
26144	We all assume that tax reductions will be permanent.	No
13724	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	No
28959	But he promised seniors that their social security benefits would not be reduced, and he promised them the same trillion dollars.	Yes
28319	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	No
7198	The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	Yes
15256	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	No
19309	I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	Yes
16407	And he was right then, and we are still man's last best hope on earth.	No
22999	I don't see how you can lead the troops if you say it's the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time.	No
6070	Forty-seven million Americans do not have health insurance in America today.	Yes
26779	It's ad hoc, no matter what happens, we'll take care of it.	No
14958	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	No
15891	I was on file in western Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	No
20351	It's called immediate help hand.	No
6911	I think your health care is just as important as any Washington politician, D.C.	No
30410	And she became an American citizen, and you can bet...	No
15229	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	No
1174	The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	No
19017	My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.	No
21559	I just want to say one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	No
17579	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	Yes
20550	And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	No
28251	Governor Bush is for the good, and in his plan, he proposes to drain more money, more money from taxpayers from public schools for private school bonds than all the money he offers in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	Yes
17848	I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.	No
9203	And I know he keeps saying you want to go bankrupt in Detroit.	No
29775	Now I believe in community policing.	No
20348	According to Governor Bush's plan, they would not get a cent for four to five years, then they would be forced to enter an HMO or insurance company and ask for coverage, but there would be no limit on premiums, deductibles or any of the conditions.	Yes
14765	Who's the best person to get results and not talk?	No
28381	It's just the right position to take.	No
25757	I left public life on June 11 of this year.	No
12221	And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	No
12442	Jim, one of the issues I would like to address in my statement is education, because it is an example of the global approach that I think is important.	No
13660	He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	Yes
3108	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	Yes
20504	I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	No
19734	I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.	Yes
23980	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	No
6836	That's why I'm a great believer in the reform of medical responsibility.	No
2562	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	No
7897	And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	No
16298	An administration that wants billions on weapons systems that we do not need and that we cannot afford, and that now confronts us with a very serious problem, and factories that are supposed to produce tritium and plutonium and provide the materials needed for existing weapons.	No
13278	He didn't take that position on Tibet.	Yes
15745	But there are limits to what we can spend.	No
6995	I will not cut the benefits.	No
34141	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	No
7931	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	No
25153	Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	Yes
16846	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	Yes
7256	My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.	No
28960	So this is a show me state.	No
27580	I see our trade deficit with China, bigger than it is -- growing every year, actually.	Yes
24040	Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	Yes
17002	We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	No
5810	That's all my campaign is and that's all it will continue to be.	No
24280	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	No
7425	I hit the driveway.	No
9560	I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.	No
12650	Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	No
26516	You're gonna have to look at him.	No
9905	And that's what I did administratively.	No
28684	The government should stand on the parents' side.	No
24200	Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.	No
26758	You see it in the church burnings.	No
15048	These are public jobs that these people really want to enter the private labour market where there are jobs with a future.	No
27114	I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.	No
15668	But I have defined the questions and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis pass this election without explaining some of these very liberal positions, he is a traditional Liberal Progressive Liberal Democrat.	No
3631	And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.	Yes
840	And he took a huge blow and everyone knows now that he took a very unfair blow.	No
12616	Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	Yes
24640	Justice Thomas-Anita Hill's hearings have always been low in our country, and these senators should hang their heads in shame for what they did there.	No
3131	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	Yes
12940	You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	Yes
243	And you have to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then I'm also someone who believes that we need to go further in cleanliness - by being sure that the blood supply is pure.	No
18013	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	No
25192	You put your thumb on a button and someone blows 20 minutes later.	No
1211	I fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, I recommended and Congress approved a much larger land and water conservation program.	Yes
11984	But having said that, I think -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things on this subject.	No
26008	And we will.	No
29995	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	No
2214	They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.	No
21123	That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	Yes
2155	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	No
6785	I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	No
33037	I'll bring back our energy companies.	No
12635	More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	Yes
26781	Let me reiterate that there is no greater responsibility for the President than to say that if you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence, that is all we need to know.	No
12989	We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	Yes
12074	She's worked on it longer than I have.	No
3343	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	Yes
363	We have more and more communities in this country where our own children cannot afford to live in the communities in which they grew up.	No
9175	I want to do this in industries, not just Detroit, but across the country, and that means we're changing our tax code, so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	No
20460	My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.	No
9650	You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	No
25554	But Mr. Mondale seems to approve of the MAD -- the MAD is an assured mutual destruction -- that is, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we must prevent you from doing that is that we will kill as many people as you will kill from ours.	Yes
8477	Well obviously my views are a little different.	No
27716	And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	Yes
9506	And why do I want to lower rates, and at the same time reduce exemptions and deductions, especially for high-level people?	No
11739	I certainly agree with that.	No
5495	And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	No
25602	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	No
7502	We can raise our schools.	No
18964	And so I told him my opinion.	No
26971	You said that, first of all, we should not have a timetable in Afghanistan.	Yes
16569	I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	Yes
16675	Now, I cannot, and do not, approve the kind of program that Governor Carter recommends.	No
19535	You look at Haiti, where we spend about $3 billion and we received an alarm call about two weeks ago.	Yes
17009	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	No
11332	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	No
13495	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	No
1497	So the polls for me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or -- or my despair.	No
29382	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	No
12921	He can now say that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn, leaving these islands outside the perimeter of the defence.	No
8185	This year, a year of recovery, we see that it is six and nine tenths and one of the highest in the world today.	Yes
26234	And that is why I must say that I agree with General Colin Powell that we are not there yet.	No
24576	We don't have to waste anyone in this country.	No
12852	If we are strong, especially when we are facing a crisis in Berlin - which we can in spring or winter - it is important that we retain our determination here; that we indicate that we are strengthening our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we are determined to protect our commitment.	No
91	And what I'm going to say is not classified.	No
8788	So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	No
21209	One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	No
25603	I remember the night before I became Vice President.	No
32347	And the last thing I'd say is the 10th or 12th time he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	Yes
25071	It is true more than 10 years ago that I voted to delay the production of the F-14, and I will tell you why.	Yes
28474	In the Senate, I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's father in the resolution of the Persian Gulf War.	Yes
13093	There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	Yes
1452	We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	No
18906	The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	Yes
4188	Their actions in Georgia are unacceptable.	No
12660	I look at the Soviet flag on the moon.	No
16657	We recommended that in housing program h- we can reduce installments and moderate monthly payments.	Yes
17039	Your mothers and fathers have done the same for you and others.	No
13362	We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.	Yes
25053	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as it has done in many of these countries, especially recently in Poland, I think we should insist that the Western credits granted to the Soviet Union bring the rate of the market.	No
1972	And I worked with the Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars from our discretionary internal budget.	Yes
15904	And I am not assailing him on this issue, or others on this issue.	No
8734	That we are, indeed, a nation rich in energy.	No
3428	And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	No
32262	When they see hatred continue, they must report it.	No
20546	They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	No
11429	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	No
3484	So -- the question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, yes, we have to solve this problem in the short term.	No
13866	They both said they were Vietnam veterans who supported me because I had an economic program to get them back to work.	No
12325	I think so.	No
16659	We believe that we can do better work in the area of crime, but this requires a more severe conviction, some mandatory prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	No
16353	But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
26352	But keep in mind that this bill covers 5 per cent of employers, and 95 per cent of employers and all employees they employ are not covered by this legislation.	Yes
10175	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	No
29793	We need a thorough background check, and we need to keep the weapons out of the hands of those who will hurt.	No
29327	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	No
7849	Fourthly, I believe that we should not pursue a policy of hard money and high interest rates which certainly helped to intensify the 1958 recession, and I think it contributed to the slowdown of 1960.	No
2820	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
22842	Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.	Yes
121	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	No
7627	I think we should have a stronger military force.	No
32298	And it's a mistake and it's in the hands of terrorists to act as if we were.	No
34037	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	Yes
26453	Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	No
1409	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	No
14295	Look at Lynn Martin, who fights against this glass ceiling and does a first-class job on it.	Yes
4044	You might think that with this kind of concern, Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, especially given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chair.	No
28145	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	No
3568	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	Yes
26971	You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	Yes
22619	And I saw a unique threat to Saddam Hussein, just like my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	No
34302	And during the ceasefire, Russia took back huge earth watches, and then they said that we no longer want the ceasefire.	Yes
20849	Show us if they learn to read, write, add and subtract and if there are bonus plans.	No
2494	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	Yes
32599	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York with an even greater margin than the first time.	Yes
8397	And the only conditions in which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a serious national emergency or a serious recession.	No
1963	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
23244	Because we cut taxes on everyone -- remember, we increased the children's credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10% cut, all those paying taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our country's history.	Yes
5938	You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.	No
21163	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	No
30303	And they're gonna end up having nuclear power.	No
876	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.	No
6237	The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.	No
16473	At the time, Mr. Gannon, I had recommended a tax reduction of $28 billion, three quarters of the taxes paid to taxpayers and 25% to U.S. businesses.	Yes
8473	And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	Yes
11976	And I think that's the way it ought to be.	No
7626	I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	No
8599	The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.	Yes
34277	This would not only happen on the first day.	No
22184	And so I think we need to have power in the hands of teachers, not the teachers' union.	No
19253	Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	No
31911	I said things that, frankly, you hear those things I said.	No
22990	That's why the Patriot Act was important.	No
33270	Thus, you can regulate if you do it with the life and health of the mother taken into account.	No
16797	He says he learned to pair unemployment with inflation.	No
4326	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	Yes
2979	The Arabs put pressure on Mr.Ford, and he gave in, and allowed a boycott by Arab countries of American companies trading with Israel, or who have American Jews who own or take part in the management of American companies.	Yes
17175	No one else believes that's the case.	No
2510	And the choices we made were those that ultimately benefit middle-class families across the country.	Yes
4341	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	No
32577	Why didn't you do it?	No
17395	And today, without the federal government being involved in anything other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words of this commission, we find 35 states with task forces that are now dealing with their educational problems.	Yes
1032	I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.	No
19954	It was bad for the country and calling it conservative won't help.	No
26179	$6 billion for Pell grants, very, very important.	Yes
8181	We heard tonight, for example, the statement that our national product growth last year was the weakest of all industrial nations in the world.	Yes
3217	And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	No
17584	Now, the social security tax of 77 -- it was indeed a tax that hit people in the hardest lower brackets.	No
19798	I also want a bridge to the truth.	No
2815	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	No
28829	And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	Yes
12983	Senator Kennedy has said this evening again what he has said several times in this debate - these debates and this campaign - that the Americans are still.	No
3296	But at the same time, I, like the National Security Council, had a responsibility to resolve the problem.	No
301	I am not questioning his patriotism.	No
12022	The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.	No
28140	I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.	No
27241	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	No
11034	And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	Yes
32483	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	Yes
28816	Well, you establish respect for differences.	No
7402	I think we have a lot more work to do.	No
9939	Now, let me mention another thing, and it's self-deportation that says people make their own choices.	No
20839	And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	Yes
28754	We need a reform of campaign financing and we need to get the young and old people right and tell them what the real choices are.	No
20113	And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
31890	I apologize to the American people.	No
32599	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	Yes
31945	That's why -- to get back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we should all -- to every boy and girl and, in fact, to the whole world that America is already big, but we're big because we're good, and we'll respect each other, and we'll work with each other, and we'll celebrate our diversity.	No
17191	I think we're getting better all the time.	No
4397	And they know that I'll take care of them.	No
17377	Again, I'm aware of that.	No
26917	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do what the president did.	No
3001	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	Yes
620	That's my answer is not to make these unilateral cuts, and everyone now realizes that peace by force is working, and that's where I have a big difference.	No
2648	And these companies, many of them have lost their activities, I think half of them, those that have been invested have lost their activities.	Yes
18623	I never wanted to hire troops.	No
29891	She failed to get the birth certificate.	Yes
244	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply with regard to operations, surgery and things of this nature.	No
24000	We need to have a growing employment base to give us a growing tax base.	No
875	I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	No
2885	I won't appoint my firm until I'm elected.	No
26628	Now none of this will happen.	No
1395	Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	No
12051	Let me say something about Columbine.	No
3233	Another point I wanna make is this.	No
4025	I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.	No
26401	Congress has passed a law on the reduction of red tape.	No
17884	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all liked him.	No
14583	That's what worries me --	No
4022	"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""	No
27642	And we are now in a position where we have achieved many of the goals that have led us there in the first place.	No
1914	My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.	No
16844	Now, you have listed some things - the foreign income carry-over is estimated to save about $500 million.	Yes
28194	There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.	No
18960	This is precisely what Vladimir Putin also understands.	No
17812	In 1979, we had a deficit of $29 billion all year round.	Yes
15434	Those who listen to my voice will have to decide on the future of this country.	No
11486	I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.	No
19451	But I have a better idea.	No
29511	But you'll learn more about Donald Trump by going to the federal election, where I filed a 104-page financial statement essentially, the forms they have.	Yes
20931	You don't test every year.	No
26136	There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.	Yes
23961	It was the people who in the 1980s saw their income increase as their taxes decreased.	Yes
14963	In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	Yes
24854	What we have to do is empower people.	No
20746	These are very clear differences.	No
15431	And the final judgment on the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reluctance, reflection, care, consideration, concern - must be made by man in the Oval Office.	No
16670	We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	No
6540	We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.	Yes
14745	This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	No
32011	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	Yes
13935	Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	No
7781	Secondly, I believe that, to the point where it is much better for the United States, rather than focusing our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment, we have contributed three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment to Laos.	Yes
33991	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	Yes
13488	The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	No
1168	And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.	No
9514	We don't have to settle for how many months, 43 months with unemployment over 8%, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	Yes
14173	I wouldn't have taken any other options.	No
13535	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	No
8555	Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	Yes
20102	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	Yes
6225	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	No
16250	I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	No
1980	Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.	No
28949	Instead of inflating and multiplying the debt four times, we have seen the debt begin to be repaid.	Yes
8340	Now, I can only say this.	No
24902	To do this, we need a three-pronged attack: military assistance to our friends who are under pressure; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid programme and a human rights programme that offers a better life and a clearer alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that continues the possibilities of peace in the region.	No
7047	We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	Yes
20754	There is a huge difference in this campaign.	No
1058	If I were to decide in the future to discuss my deep Christian beliefs and condemnation and sin, I would use another forum other than Playboy.	No
2147	$716 billion saved us the Medicare program by not paying insurance companies too much by making sure we don't pay suppliers too much.	Yes
32321	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	Yes
7697	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	No
2755	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	Yes
1752	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	No
350	I'd say about 30%.	No
27855	This is a company, this isn't basic research.	No
25687	And you have to ask yourself if you know enough about the candidates?	No
33892	And I hope that in the last few weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what is at stake in this election.	No
13831	I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.	Yes
18538	"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""	No
27210	We don't know what the world is going to throw us on the road.	No
26136	There's $7 trillion in fixed assets in America.	Yes
33705	We're growing -- our last report is out -- and it's about 1%.	Yes
1403	But when there is, uh - a very narrow decision - which often comes to the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	No
21423	And everybody says they take responsibility.	No
21418	The dollar went through the ground.	No
11360	That's what America's all about.	No
13772	I have repeatedly spoken against anti-Semitism and racism, and I believe that my dossier as a member of Congress speaks for itself on this subject.	Yes
16499	Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.	Yes
14732	But we need to do even better.	No
24107	But he's talking about hard medicine, and I think it's good.	No
7749	It is fought mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America.	Yes
2868	I think it's, uh - an example of deliberate distortion, and that also happened in the defence issue.	No
16247	There will be no more debates.	No
26288	How do we pay for this?	No
30126	It's a lot of money to protect others.	No
10122	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mother came, and it seemed incredible, good as new.	No
10095	And suggest -- am I wrong about that, on Sunday, your secretary --	No
15742	Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	Yes
18052	And it was only when former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said that you must go to the UN, that the President finally changed his mind - his campaign has a word for it - and went to the United Nations.	Yes
1491	And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.	No
8620	And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.	No
33362	I therefore believe that we are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	No
33541	He was a very cavalier, even occasionally, with regard to the use of nuclear weapons.	No
14486	Debt and deficit.	No
11043	I do not understand how we eventually invaded a country that had nothing to do with 11 September, when Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda set up base camps and shelters to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
32627	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	No
24021	I think it is important that the United States remain in Europe and continue to guarantee peace.	No
4172	Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	No
15910	It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	No
17211	And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.	No
18156	What message does that send the Iraqis?	No
9194	If the unemployment rate was 7.8% when he took office, it is 7.8% now.	Yes
26552	First of all, I think it is important to make the vote more accessible.	No
32522	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	Yes
8375	And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	Yes
8434	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.	Yes
3068	These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	No
28640	I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	No
28345	And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.	No
33284	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	Yes
30303	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	No
1714	And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.	No
17129	This is the worst trade year in American history by far.	Yes
22144	Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	No
32517	I want to have a surtax on revenues over $5 million.	No
1249	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	No
8199	We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.	Yes
14961	One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	Yes
26168	I look at our economic plan because I'm worried about the future of young people.	No
32974	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	No
27608	But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to do to keep the American people safe and to advance our interests, and I make those decisions.	No
6991	We paid down the debt for two years.	Yes
6522	I have not had an influenza vaccine, and I do not intend to do so because I want to make sure that those who are most vulnerable are treated.	No
16601	We also need to significantly reduce the number of agencies and programs.	No
11889	And if that's not the case, there must be a consequence.	No
1251	We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.	Yes
3079	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	Yes
22200	And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	No
919	I support the agricultural bill, the 1985 agricultural bill, and the spending is moving in the right direction.	No
9454	No tax on your savings.	No
20242	And for every dollar I spend in these two categories, I'm going to put $2 to pay off the national debt.	No
29828	It's hard to believe, 500 is like it's supposed to be good?	No
12113	If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	No
13672	I do not think the answer is to further slow down the economy, increase unemployment and undermine the health of the private sector.	No
30352	But you have to have some basic ability.	No
24073	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	Yes
358	Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	Yes
19123	America is the largest place on the face of the earth.	No
33841	And after that, a number of women came forward and said that's exactly what he did to them.	Yes
677	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	No
19971	And then let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without tax penalty for education, home purchase or medical expenses, that's the right way to go in the 21st century, balance the budget and reduce taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax regime.	No
22260	I've done a study on this, they're ineffective.	No
20757	He said in his speech that he wanted to make sure that the right people get tax relief.	Yes
11202	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	No
26349	That was a tax credit for the employer.	No
9515	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the President took office.	Yes
1250	Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	No
8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	No
4111	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who is one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, has just said that we should meet Iran -- guess what -- without preconditions.	Yes
7110	They're much better protected today than they were when I was governor of Texas.	Yes
10350	I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	Yes
16243	Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.	No
17768	If you were to tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	No
10475	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	No
8492	Of course, we cannot control the Senate.	No
6315	And if we're going to do some things you mentioned, like lower loan rates or what you have, someone has to pay for it.	No
14461	But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	No
15528	And so I'm proud of my choice.	No
18392	We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.	Yes
14134	So the answer is I could do that.	No
33471	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	Yes
21788	If the American people send me to do this job, I intend to be a term.	No
25837	We need to help people who are between jobs.	No
2487	That's the wrong way to go.	No
17368	Tonight, we had the first debate on the deficit.	No
17004	It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	No
12542	Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	No
3878	We don't want our kids coming back here.	No
13256	And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	No
24317	We must continue negotiations to reduce nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union and the United States.	No
749	We must be ready to use military force against terrorist base camps, we must work closely with our allies to ensure that they work with us and with them and that we cannot give a quarter to break the back of international terrorism.	No
24737	More and more people are getting there as poverty increases.	Yes
12938	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	Yes
27539	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
30068	She's been doing it for a long time.	No
34057	He lost the Iowa caucus.	Yes
950	And then it comes back to a question of values.	No
26084	We've got a good job, we're studying to be a doctor.	No
8145	I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.	No
12732	We will select the best man we can get.	No
13234	We all have temperaments; I have one; I am sure Senator Kennedy has one.	No
6098	Here's your fine -- zero.	No
22913	And a lot of our military are underpaid.	Yes
14848	This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	No
13658	And for what Mr Bush says, he's the one who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	Yes
27684	And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	No
13664	Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	No
29725	Now, whether you're in a place like Chicago or not, you stop and you're chilling, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, very well worked in New York.	Yes
18076	I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	No
7607	I hope that this will one day arise; but I do not think it will happen if we pursue the same policies towards Cuba as we have done in recent years, and in fact towards all Latin America - when we have almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we have not teleported a single program from the Voice of America in Spanish to all Latin America over the last eight years, with the exception of the three months of the Hungarian revolution.	Yes
33346	We have 11 million people without papers.	Yes
31955	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	Yes
16278	I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.	No
3108	As soon as I became President, I started a meeting with NATO Heads of State and met them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve re-defence relations in Western Europe.	Yes
58	But I think we're all in this business together, and my appeal to the American people is values in schools.	No
12645	And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	No
11664	I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.	No
8088	That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	No
32808	But she lied about a lot of things.	Yes
19193	So some may be better off.	No
15500	And here, on this particular issue, I have a big difference with my opponent.	No
2012	You have found 4 trillion ways to reduce or get closer to a balanced budget, except that we still have trillion dollar deficits every year.	Yes
14877	Force is imperative for peace, but both must go hand in hand.	No
4211	"I looked in Mr Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, one ""K"", one ""G"" and one ""B""."	No
8463	Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.	Yes
4273	And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	No
27535	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, and then in many years.	Yes
17802	Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	Yes
25758	But it's very important.	No
19284	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	No
12298	I think there's a difference.	No
24221	Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	No
5659	Another would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	No
7821	So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.	No
13621	And that is why I want to reduce the deficit by controlling the growth of compulsory expenditure.	No
1265	I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	Yes
7603	Secondly, I did not criticise him for not calling for free elections.	No
16038	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not so confident.	No
158	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	No
25955	You should be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years old.	No
4042	And when I'm president, I will.	No
6786	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	Yes
4244	The first is that we must have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	No
16144	It promotes this maintenance of supply or production controls.	No
10450	But that's only step one.	No
26175	In my opinion, we want to find jobs, opportunities and education.	No
855	No, I think the debate should be between you and Lloyd.	No
21610	We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	No
8711	And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.	No
21782	I am in favour of strict controls on the amount of money you can spend to come to Congress, strict limits on political action committees, demands that the candidates to Congress appear in open public debates as we do now.	No
19705	Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	No
11640	And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	No
22417	One is to reduce spending -- control mandatory spending.	No
21095	I want you to have your own asset that you can call yours.	No
10695	I want to go online through all the items in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those who work, work better and less expensive.	No
3497	A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.	No
27028	...from the agreement of the forces to the end of the conflict that existed.	No
25599	And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.	No
28685	Parents teach their children the good of evil, and the message is often undermined by popular culture.	No
29814	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	No
7615	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	No
6861	But instead of helping you, the taxpayer, to have a lower cost, rather than helping seniors get cheaper drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- that Medicare actually go to negotiate for lower prices.	Yes
16302	Who manages this system?	No
14179	But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.	Yes
3960	He said he'd launch military strikes in Pakistan.	Yes
13535	Let us look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	No
34146	So we're now going to take Mosul.	No
3113	I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	No
22741	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	No
33404	We either have a border or we don't.	No
19525	Well, I have a different view.	No
29317	And I have been a secretary of state...	No
7017	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	No
4283	What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	No
9918	Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.	No
17724	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	No
21812	We must therefore, in my opinion, have a radical simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everyone.	No
7740	When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	No
14587	He would do for the United States what he did to Arkansas.	No
10975	Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.	No
30369	You asked me a question.	No
4005	In 1983, when I was a brand new Member of Parliament for the United States, he was the person I admired the most and admired the most, Ronald Reagan, who wanted to send Marines to Lebanon.	Yes
20111	We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	Yes
33147	What kind of rights will Americans have?	No
4093	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	No
1050	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	Yes
21664	Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	No
10223	Half a million jobs in manufacturing have been lost over the past four years.	Yes
8536	And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	No
13608	Do I have a minute?	No
77	Now I have outlined in detail a program to be hard on law enforcement at home and abroad, double the number of drug law enforcement officers, have a hemispheric summit shortly after January 20 when we bring our democratic neighbours and allies here in this hemisphere and will work together.	Yes
3052	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	No
8138	He has as many chances of going to college as a white student.	Yes
26623	And social security is not enough for a large number of people to live or, at least, not enough for them to maintain something like their previous lifestyle.	No
20720	We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	No
26428	We have a good and stable economic policy.	No
14084	We have already destroyed the air transport industry because of all these leverage buyouts and all the terrible things that have happened to the air transport industry.	Yes
23339	Off-road diesel engines -- we have an agreement to reduce off-road diesel emissions by 90%.	Yes
24034	Today, you have problems in Europe, still evolving, even if Europe has gone through the path of democracy.	No
29620	And it's really a shame.	No
33871	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	No
26483	Let me just give you one tiny example.	No
22283	Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	No
7943	I therefore believe that the policies that I recommend are part of the overall strengthening of the United States.	No
2526	Anyone can have deductions up to that amount.	No
27581	I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	Yes
26936	This is the opportunity we need.	No
18837	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	No
1402	Emphasis should be placed on the interpretation of the Constitution and laws between the protection of property and personal protection.	No
16718	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	No
20072	And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	No
23697	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	No
5908	It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	No
13401	In addition, we need to move forward in other areas that hinder growth.	No
7140	The president denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he does not hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	Yes
26977	Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	No
32377	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	No
14174	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	No
16251	It's my five seconds.	No
21757	I strongly support the terms of office of the members of the United States Congress.	No
621	Of course, we will have to make a certain decision on this, and we will have to do so on the strength of the assembly.	No
17184	It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	No
28784	That's the best way to get people back in the system.	No
33105	And they did a wonderful job, and they were wonderful, wonderful children.	No
1431	The inflation rate, as announced the other day, is less than 5 per cent, and the 4.4 per cent rate that was reported at the time of the 4 per cent GNP was below the 5.4 per cent rate.	Yes
24807	There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.	No
25629	And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	No
9899	And that's what we've done.	No
2277	As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	No
19129	Jack Kemp is my racing companion, doing a remarkable job.	No
18026	That's why they're fighting so vociferously.	No
27343	States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.	Yes
30064	We're going to eliminate ISIS.	No
2388	It was not only the main driver of our federal deficit, our overall cost of health care, but it was families who were worried about bankruptcy if they were sick, millions of families across the country.	Yes
10875	Just as the computer was originally invented by a group of government scientists trying to understand, for defence purposes, how to communicate, we must understand that it is also a national security problem.	Yes
27518	They must not develop nuclear capability.	No
18843	But I just know how this world works, and that in government councils, there must be some certainty on the part of the American president.	No
18991	You know my opinion on North Korea.	No
12528	We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	Yes
23929	Or did they happen while you were a senior federal government official?	No
34457	We're going to make America strong again, and we're going to make America big again, and it has to start now.	No
13823	And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	No
3580	But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.	No
3808	The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.	No
1760	But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	Yes
11913	I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	No
32538	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	Yes
30364	And I don't think she has endurance.	No
1321	However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.	No
8393	And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	No
16456	And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	No
33702	They grow to 8%.	Yes
3619	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	No
26527	In other words, I believe that physicians should not be able to be expelled from managed care plans simply because they tell patients what they need and what more costly care options could be.	No
22720	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	No
16284	With regard to regional tensions, we have now drawn the attention of the Soviet Union.	No
19110	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	No
34079	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	No
20017	I'm not talking about Whitewater now.	No
24675	The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	No
3943	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	Yes
20071	I wish the Americans knew that I worked very hard to be on their side.	No
19561	He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	Yes
23058	"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	No
7642	We cannot afford a lack of intelligence.	No
23844	And the way we're going to do it is to have a whole new Congress.	No
13029	It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	No
7739	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	No
21116	Let me tell you what your plan is.	No
19325	The trial lawyers and I, you know, my wife is a lawyer.	No
8322	I do not think it has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	No
33616	We will have a massive and massive increase in taxes under Hillary Clinton's plan.	Yes
13204	I fully supported the treaty.	Yes
13432	Many say four and a half per cent.	No
28816	Well, you establish respect for differences.	No
22615	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	No
7016	Now, if later, after a while, we discover that social security is in trouble, we will bring together the best experts in the country.	No
23584	There is no litmus test except the way they interpret the Constitution.	No
19556	Then, from World War I to World War II, we had a policy of compulsory engagement.	No
8127	I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	Yes
20982	I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.	No
26244	It seems to me that we should support the California civil rights initiative.	No
4179	I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	No
31912	And I was embarrassed by that.	No
12065	And we can enforce the law.	No
10381	Social security people who have worked their whole lives.	No
16901	Well, it seems to me that, uh - we have a chance - Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	No
8027	I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	No
27670	This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.	No
31945	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	No
24843	Take a look at the Middle East.	No
12585	Is our relative strength growing?	No
29278	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	Yes
1113	The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	No
24900	I believe that the question is too simple for what we have to do in Central America.	No
24536	First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	No
18209	Patriotic law is vital - it is vital that Congress renews the patriotic law that allows our law enforcement forces to disrupt terrorist cells.	No
16712	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	Yes
24911	A president is called the Commander-in-Chief.	No
13304	We can't be content with anything but the best.	No
20348	Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	Yes
3365	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	No
14187	That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	No
21555	I'm making the cards you see on TV.	No
16536	Keep my promises to the American people.	No
32188	And not only expensive for the person who has it, incredibly expensive for our country.	No
3622	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	Yes
6628	And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	No
25539	"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you stand back and say, ""Oops, we didn't know the weapon was loaded,"" and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	No
34078	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	No
11173	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	No
27111	That's exactly what we're doing.	No
25554	But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.	Yes
32416	Her papers went to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everyone, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	Yes
16864	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	No
12925	The resolution calls on the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend, uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	Yes
9071	I am running for the presidency as an independent because I believe that our country has problems.	No
10766	You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.	Yes
9302	And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	No
1591	It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	Yes
1267	In addition, because of my pressure on Congress, we have had an important public transit programme over a four-year period of $11 billion, $800 million.	Yes
7321	They do not achieve these objectives.	No
9278	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	No
21717	I'm not for national firearms registration.	Yes
8309	I think this agricultural policy has failed.	No
15026	It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.	No
24771	Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	No
7295	I ran one of America's largest prosecutor's offices, one of the top ten.	Yes
15958	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	No
12046	The woman who bought the weapons for the two boys who killed in Columbine said if she had to give her name and fill out a form there, she wouldn't have bought those weapons.	No
1165	At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	No
20167	I'm here to prove that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	No
13152	Fewer than a hundred people have worked on this issue across the federal government, and I believe this has been reflected in our success and failures in Geneva.	Yes
19286	It's a good package, Mr. President.	No
15394	Howard, I am a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive intrusion by the government into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	No
8575	That's the same percentage as 20 years ago.	Yes
24285	And you can't convert potato chips into planes in an emergency.	No
1693	That's not what I'm gonna do.	No
20728	This is a very important moment in our country's history.	No
1155	This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	No
21205	I think we need a Attorney General who says that if a law is violated, we will apply it.	No
18736	As far as Iran is concerned, I hope that we can do the same, continue working with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	No
17587	At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.	Yes
14381	And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.	No
25238	This question of leadership continues to arise in different forms in this discussion already.	No
10349	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	Yes
15394	Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	No
20768	Let me tell you what the facts are.	No
15716	We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.	No
14089	And we're in real trouble on that.	No
16024	I voted against the National Association of Governors.	Yes
10181	But I think that one area we agree with is the importance of parents and the importance of schools, because I believe that if our young people have opportunities, they are less likely to engage in such violent acts.	No
17035	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to withdraw everything we have.	No
2430	That's why the Republicans said, don't do that, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	No
20994	I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	No
29482	The reduction of taxes on the rich has not worked.	Yes
12272	If you own the earth, every day is Earth Day.	No
12634	The rest either abstained or voted against us.	Yes
18190	I'm going to do it in four years.	No
18966	Russia is a country in transition.	No
31961	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	No
25758	But it is very important.	No
7208	We have to make sure they're educated.	No
8063	"And therefore, I don't think it's enough to go in front of the Republican public - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	No
11011	That's how it works in banks.	No
24961	I have so much to answer, I'm gonna pick something you said earlier.	No
29772	There are the right ways to do this, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	No
27596	But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	Yes
16328	Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	No
3726	It's a multi-year project.	Yes
12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	Yes
1510	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	No
19315	I did a lot of things that were controversial.	No
29149	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	No
18088	He was hoping we'd turn away.	No
743	In fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism that issued a report shortly before that decision was taken and rightly said that we can never make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	Yes
25948	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	No
1419	And I don't think the file justifies the conclusion you're reaching.	No
22730	I meet them all the time.	No
13592	There are many people who believe that the only way to turn this country is to impose the middle class more and punish it more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans that have been taxed more in the 1980s and in the last 12 years, even though their incomes have declined.	Yes
4046	But the important thing is that I visited Afghanistan, travelled to Waziristan and travelled to those places, and I know what our security requirements are.	No
22809	"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	No
19224	But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	No
6786	"And as President Kennedy said when he came to the presidency, he said, ""I'm not running to be Catholic president."	Yes
23235	I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	No
30301	All they have to do is stay back for 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	No
8916	Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.	Yes
2639	All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.	No
6600	He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	Yes
34428	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	No
14846	Not only have we kept peace for our own country, but we have been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	No
16443	Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	No
311	Of course, the vice president questions my patriotism.	No
20237	I said that his tax reduction plan, for example, raises the question of whether this is the right choice for the country.	No
14148	He got a notice or he didn't.	No
12376	We all make mistakes.	No
29488	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	No
8666	That, once again, the printing presses will start rolling; once again, we will see the monetization of this debt translate into a higher rate of inflation.	No
26370	He said it would hurt the economy.	No
2276	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	No
14404	I said well, this is simple.	No
10698	So we need to prioritize our spending and tax policies to make sure they work for you.	No
34285	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	No
17451	And at the end of all this, no evidence was presented that the unborn child was not alive.	Yes
22843	So what do we do?	No
11660	We have to work with Nigeria.	No
34151	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	Yes
19109	We can build this bridge until the 21st century.	No
11957	I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
34184	He's still looking for a conspiracy.	No
444	And I think it'd be prohibitive.	No
16341	I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	No
16180	I led the working group when I was a member of Congress in the late 1960s on this kind of thing, on the Republican side.	No
1297	The FHA, which was a very responsible agency, which everyone was looking for to help own a house, lost six million dollars last year.	Yes
28776	There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	No
9593	And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we had everything we needed.	No
18451	We must deny them refuges.	No
26574	But maybe there ought to be more debates.	No
17879	"I think there is optimism in the earth and patriotism, and I think we are once again able to take into account the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have in our power to start the world again""."	No
18157	No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.	No
7619	We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	Yes
16636	And there was a very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, to a Senate committee a few months ago about how he found the Medicaid program when he took office after Governor Carter.	No
1975	And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	Yes
18569	You have to close the borders.	No
26536	17 new taxes, price control, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
20759	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	No
25884	He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	Yes
33458	People are going to come in from Syria.	No
19791	And he was telling me things that I knew were wrong.	No
16801	This affects human beings, and - and its insensitivity to provide these people with a chance to work has made this an administration of well-being, not an administration of work.	No
2795	Our country is no longer strong, we are no longer respected.	No
2065	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	No
29462	We've looked at your tax proposals.	No
6248	He's healthy for the mother.	No
11509	When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.	No
24200	Now, assemble your plans by Christmas, be ready to leave when Congress leaves, nail these things.	No
13376	But Social Security is a tax.	No
8206	We find that your salary has increased five times more in the Eisenhower administration than in the Truman administration.	Yes
9708	Our party has been focused too long.	No
17398	So I think many democrats see the same thing that this democrat has seen: leadership does not take us where we want to go.	No
11417	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now regarded by the peoples of all other continents and by the peoples of all parts of the earth as a model for what their future might be.	No
10767	The only strong point is that more than 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	Yes
21609	And each of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all said areas of passage to the company.	No
2573	Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	No
16701	But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	Yes
24550	This is a relevant question here tonight.	No
7592	And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	Yes
26056	It's the United States of America.	No
17171	First, I think tonight's first answer suggests exactly what I'm saying.	No
16706	We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	No
9773	"When they said, ""We're going to cut down on parental planning funding."""	No
18103	Seventy-five per cent of his people had been brought to justice.	Yes
20961	It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	No
1876	Now, and -- and I talked to a guy who has a very small business.	No
20577	Milosevic lost the election.	No
8509	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	No
33693	We are beginning to see some increase in income, and we have certainly had a long and growing series of jobs.	Yes
25882	I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	Yes
523	If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	No
13197	And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	No
4328	We need to make sure we harden our chemical sites.	No
24295	Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	Yes
20822	A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	No
26507	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	No
23779	And abroad, we're at war.	No
30169	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	Yes
28162	It's a national scandal.	No
30085	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	No
3280	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	Yes
25028	I have no illusions about the leadership of the Soviet Union or the nature of this state.	No
333	I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	No
751	That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	No
19378	But let me answer what you said.	No
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
11743	We've had some disagreements about that.	No
17273	I am sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are all strengthened by that fact.	No
23081	Now, he talks about Medicare.	No
24520	#NAME?	No
25945	So you add it up.	No
232	The Special Federal Commission has made sound recommendations.	No
26777	Now that was quite an admission.	No
15773	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	Yes
1330	It seems to me that there should be an opportunity, as long as it is voluntary, as long as there is no coercion, that an individual should have that right.	No
8584	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	No
14325	We told him that we would not be involved in his border dispute, and we never revealed the papers that were handed over to Ambassador Glaspie on 25 July.	Yes
25947	Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	No
24475	They develop a positive or negative self-image.	No
14421	Several departments -- many -- had the information that they were converting our assistance for military purposes and were trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
19157	We had a BTU tax that we turned into a $35 million gas tax, an increase of $265 billion.	Yes
26674	"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	No
11200	It's the same overall strategy.	No
678	And at the same time, a willingness to move forward on a regular, thoughtful and cautious basis.	No
15834	And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	No
14061	But this deal we're making with LAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign great time: a guy from the northwest.	Yes
7719	Senator Kennedy has expressed hopes in this area, hopes that I think all Americans would share and want a problem - some progress in this area.	No
24642	Second thing, there aren't many times in your life when you can talk to a whole country.	No
33494	Hillary, you have no idea.	No
27573	But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	No
32936	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
12210	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	Yes
515	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	No
9866	I want our legal system to work better.	No
19381	So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	No
14747	Absolutely, we can win, because it's your country.	No
8189	Is it true that this administration, as Senator Kennedy accused it, was an administration of retirement, defeat, stagnation?	No
5743	I have the scars to prove it.	No
24197	Then descend to a start in 93 to execute these plans.	No
13647	I think it's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're embarking on.	No
16722	There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.	No
16772	Inflation is the fastest way to destroy jobs.	No
12583	Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.	No
21213	And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	No
7902	It would not be appropriate for me to do so.	No
15786	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	No
33090	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	No
1064	I believe that the American people were interrupted in this election for various reasons.	No
25622	We should not remain in the past, nor even in the present.	No
15276	With our five-year offshore lease plan, we have proposed more drilling land than has been available for drilling since this program began in 1954.	Yes
32852	It's the only country he's ever known.	No
11846	We've got one in Texas.	No
22202	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	No
12708	Number three, Castro is just the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	No
20999	We need to do more and better.	No
15860	Michael Dukakis introduced himself to the sheriff, and George Bush, too.	No
19375	Mine doesn't work like that.	No
4279	I supported Nunn-Lugar in the early 1990s, when many of my colleagues did not.	Yes
28141	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	No
19123	America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.	No
24029	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make unwise cuts, if we go too far, we risk peace.	No
19518	There is now a democratically elected President in Haiti.	Yes
11030	My friends, we went to the four corners of the Earth and shed American blood to defend, in general, the freedom of someone else and ours.	No
3730	Currently, we provide $15 billion each year as subsidies to private insurers under the health insurance plan.	Yes
23614	But I cannot take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who does not share this article of faith, whether they are agnostics, atheists, Jews, Protestants, whatever.	No
20545	I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	No
24737	More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	Yes
9086	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	No
19968	That's what our message is to the people watching.	No
25593	That is why I want to lower these debts and interest rates, restore American exports, help rural America, which suffers so much, and bring back jobs here for our children.	No
3306	I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.	Yes
12563	But all this by itself is not enough.	No
26750	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	No
15169	The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.	No
17355	They see this huge influx and overflow of cheap foreign imports into this country, which has cost more than 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	Yes
24530	But I can tell you.	No
4192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and explain to the Russians that you cannot be a superpower or a power of the twenty-first century and act as a dictatorship of the twentieth century.	No
17918	We can better face our future, we can rejoice in our strengths, we can face our problems and, by solving them, we can build a better society for our children.	No
4104	Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	No
6602	And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	No
2198	And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	No
7110	They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	Yes
21098	Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	No
29289	And I -- well, not so long.	No
2532	You obviously studied my plan.	No
26567	And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	No
24078	Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	No
12270	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	No
34135	But who's gonna get Mosul, really?	No
30430	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	No
27396	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	No
28982	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people are watching.	No
4268	That's just not true, John.	No
25141	Well, the red light went on.	No
6849	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	No
29051	It's a program that says we're listening to the young voices of Social Security and that we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also about fulfilling the promise to seniors in America.	No
29274	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	Yes
5857	Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	No
23328	He voted 98 times to increase taxes.	Yes
24257	And I will continue to veto them, because I don't think we're being taxed too little.	No
25564	The Chairman said that he wished to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	Yes
25807	In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	No
8960	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to discuss Governor Reagan's case as governor.	No
507	And it's also a major difference between me and the vice president.	No
19852	Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	No
13851	Again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 a.m., my government called on me to take extraordinary measures for the Americans in distress, and again and again I answered.	No
8145	I want people to carry out their responsibilities.	No
9072	I think we're all going to have to start working together to solve our problems.	No
1499	I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	No
839	And I believe that he will be outstanding.	No
28367	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	No
2203	And the main beneficiary of this repeal is insurance companies that are estimated to earn billions of dollars while they do not make seniors healthier.	Yes
6960	First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	No
13654	I don't agree with both.	No
25487	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I do not agree with what we cannot say every day.	No
7661	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	No
19815	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	Yes
23554	"But let me tell you, white, the stem cell lines that he has put at his disposal, all the scientists in the country will say, ""not adequate,"" because they're contaminated with mouse cells, and because there's not 60 or 70 -- they're only 11 to 20 now -- and there's not enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	Yes
20011	I am very encouraged to know your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	No
27122	But look, this has been going on for a year.	Yes
24928	I have ordered an investigation.	Yes
17768	If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	No
4007	Unfortunately, I was right: nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombings of the barracks.	Yes
13281	Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	Yes
11720	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the land where they live to build nations.	No
21703	I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.	No
26411	And my word is good.	No
24519	You know, we did the Libyan raid... remember that one?	No
4015	So I have a record.	No
12915	I am opposed to the establishment of a line because I know that the moment you draw a line is an encouragement for the communists to attack - to intensify their blackmail and force you into the war that no one of us wants.	No
26528	If we save money and manage resources better, it's a good thing.	No
1734	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	No
19042	We will strengthen our intelligence collection services.	No
8236	This will cost at least four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine tenths of a year more than what we currently spend.	Yes
8964	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	Yes
19458	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	Yes
26365	Employers under the age of 50 are exempt.	Yes
9421	It's critical to our future.	No
25293	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	No
13253	I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	No
6319	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	Yes
15408	And the same would apply to combat service in the army and so on.	No
27675	We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	No
2714	Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think it was a great debate, and I really appreciate it.	No
14496	You need to reform Congress, they need to be servants of the people again, you need to reform the White House.	No
29241	Five million people have lost their homes.	Yes
17853	So far, it's just a start.	No
25984	But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	No
27979	I want to make sure our pay to take is around and starting to grow.	No
8307	The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	Yes
2549	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	No
8740	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	No
28797	Quotas tend to put one group of people against another.	No
13493	If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	No
21171	I'm going to fight for middle-class families, workers and women and I'll never let you down.	No
16700	I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	No
6531	Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	Yes
33216	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	Yes
192	It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.	No
29390	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	No
10349	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100% of my insured people, all my children, about 98 percent of adults.	Yes
13203	Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.	Yes
15401	It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.	No
23295	That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	Yes
10025	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	No
10188	And so we're pairing them.	No
18956	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war against terror.	No
8581	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	No
7459	"""Fuckfully, she didn't keep me at this deal."	No
7420	And as president, I pledge to change that.	No
741	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	No
21367	But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	No
13518	Three, a Gallup poll conducted in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought was the first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	Yes
22086	Six increases in payroll tax -- that is, people with income of $51,000 per year or less pay a disproportionate share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want middle-class tax relief.	Yes
21312	Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.	No
30123	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	Yes
22082	I am convinced, after studying health care for a year and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people across America, that you cannot control the cost of insurance until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, a cap on cost and a radical reorganization of insurance markets.	No
1732	In my view, we should provide tax relief to middle-class people.	No
7831	This means tax reform and, if necessary, tax cuts that will boost more jobs.	No
9889	We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.	No
12814	First of all, I would say that we must bear in mind the fact that we are negotiating to have the tests inspected and to obtain an agreement for many months.	Yes
1118	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	No
27956	And we keep our workers for tomorrow's jobs.	Yes
2998	Under the last democratic administration, 60 per cent of all weapons entering the Middle East were destined for Israel.	Yes
7031	Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
20351	It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	No
8893	I was there, and I met the people.	No
7693	I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	Yes
21148	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was to pronounce these famous words, ""no legal supervisory authority."""	No
16627	If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.	No
2657	And by the way, I had this experience.	No
20146	And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	No
18347	They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.	No
12406	And we need to do something about that.	No
185	And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	No
13902	In my state, we are leading the country in the growth of employment in the private sector.	Yes
16866	President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.	Yes
27076	And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	Yes
7194	We still have a long distance to travel in terms of equity in America.	No
13724	So I think we're probably making a mistake night after night to throw the nation's future on such a small unit.	No
23426	This is how you create jobs and become competitive.	No
2114	So -- let's say -- one of the beautiful things in this country is the idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	No
7327	It is also about women, it is about other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	No
15413	First of all, I would like to thank the Women's Voting League for making this debate possible.	No
27914	And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	Yes
17130	Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	No
24041	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	Yes
32129	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	No
20405	And here's the simple difference.	No
8449	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	Yes
30097	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	Yes
15097	These are just ideas of what I would think if I were in this position and had access to information, and I would know all the options that were open to me.	No
3178	Under this administration that strength has not been realized.	No
32109	Not... we've returned 35,000, so...	Yes
363	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	No
13133	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	Yes
30118	Number one, the 28 NATO countries, many of them do not pay their fair share.	Yes
17522	That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	No
17178	There's a difference between a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a president has to face it.	No
16199	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	No
33423	And it was a bipartite question.	No
959	This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.	No
23335	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	No
24310	And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	No
21725	We must win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	No
28335	94% comes from the local level.	Yes
34250	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	Yes
28570	None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	No
33347	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	Yes
2228	And, by the way, the idea did not even come from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who is the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also from Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	Yes
16531	Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	No
30020	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	Yes
2644	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	Yes
27386	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	Yes
12155	There's no need to take my word for it.	No
22110	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut off foreign help, we have a problem at home.	No
18447	And I know what many of them are saying today, and I know how to get them back to the table.	No
8726	We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	Yes
22460	And we have to get our nation back to work.	No
15253	We cannot cast aside these regulations.	No
14470	Now, in 1984, they were told.	No
21456	I think it should be a member of a presidential candidate or a president.	No
22970	95 percent of our containers arriving in this country are not inspected today.	Yes
21364	In my view, you need to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudently reducing defence, reducing national programs, and asking Americans and the richest foreign companies to pay their fair share of taxes and to invest and develop this economy.	No
26405	Before I went to the ground, my cell phone rang and the trial attorney said, I think we have a case here.	No
7172	You see, we will never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that does not abandon children, an education system that raises standards, an education that ensures excellence in each class.	No
16829	This allows a company to create a fake company, export their products, and then not to pay the total amount of taxes on them.	Yes
7708	I think the President of the United States should say that.	No
10562	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	No
26777	That was quite an admission.	No
19196	And it's in some cases because both parents work.	No
25713	60,000 criminals, fugitives and stalkers were denied handguns.	Yes
27827	Governor Romney, you did not...	No
12063	A desperate child needs someone to put his arm around them and say, we love you.	No
17483	I think these issues are intrinsically personal and moral, and each individual case is different.	No
10800	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax reduction under my plan.	Yes
5846	Bob, like I said...	No
12043	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	No
12575	I've supported him ever since.	Yes
7875	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	Yes
1562	I do not believe that the current administration has done so.	No
19054	We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	No
12248	And I'm going to tell you this, I'm going to fight for a clean environment in a way that strengthens our economy.	No
14862	And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.	No
23893	I have a lot of experience not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	No
15016	When I campaigned in 1976, wherever I went, mayors and local officials were desperate by the rapid deterioration of our nation's central cities.	No
19507	Look where we are today.	No
2513	I have to answer that.	No
1021	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	No
29516	You know what that is?	No
12561	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	No
27554	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	No
33528	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	Yes
22571	The President presided over an economy where we lost 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
7330	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	No
33524	Let me tell you that Putin overtakes her and Obama at every step of the way.	No
5951	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	Yes
16503	In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.	Yes
8888	Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	No
19594	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	No
19736	So it's not that we always disagree.	No
27532	And -- and so the strength we have shown in Iran is demonstrated by the fact that we have been able to mobilize the world.	No
8616	As I said at the beginning, the question for all of us, for all of the Republicans and for all of the Democrats is: can freedom in the next generation win, or will communists succeed?	No
21359	Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.	Yes
14819	I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.	No
24080	We spent four trillion dollars.	Yes
15911	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
29825	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	No
33094	And I think it's something that, as a mother and grandmother, is very important to me.	No
16143	We have a fundamental difference, an approach to agriculture.	No
20320	And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	No
20843	Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	No
13738	And the people who have jobs --	No
27538	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
25034	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of this direction, but we must move away and talk to find ways to reduce these differences, especially with regard to the arms race and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	No
29503	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	No
19624	And I hope that happens.	No
10387	That's what I've been doing for the last four years.	No
30123	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a large terrorist division.	Yes
10220	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	Yes
11878	Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	No
1817	But that's not the case.	No
2752	If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	No
22264	This has nothing to do with learning.	No
19204	We have a record number of new small businesses.	Yes
21748	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	No
22269	It's the only way to get it back.	No
285	I saw it written with authority twice, and if I made him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	No
3325	Again, Governor Carter is inaccurate.	No
22280	Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	No
20554	I would name people who have a philosophy that I think I have quite probable that they would support Roe v. Wade.	No
11581	I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	No
25914	I think we need to go back and take a look.	No
12939	Not in the defense of Formosa and Pescadores.	No
17988	Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential elections.	Yes
29441	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	No
1458	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone out of work.	Yes
12712	His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	Yes
848	And it will do very well when we get into the debates.	No
20955	You can see it in this campaign.	No
24579	If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	No
12910	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	No
23820	I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.	Yes
21418	The dollar's gone through the floor.	No
28114	So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	No
24825	This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	No
3152	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	Yes
19304	The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	No
8999	I myself vetoed a number of such bills when I was in California.	Yes
1455	With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.	Yes
10734	I believe in the need to increase oil production.	No
5844	But the fact is that we absolutely must not defend the kind of things that have happened.	No
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	Yes
14568	"In addition, I am not going to tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot predict what emergencies might occur in this country."	No
32446	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	Yes
27535	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	Yes
2456	Let me make one last point.	No
5943	That's what every family is talking about when it comes to defending disabled children.	No
14951	As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	Yes
9662	It makes a difference whether they can go there and -- and earn a living for their family.	No
7582	As far as Cuba is concerned today, I believe that we are following the right path, a difficult path, but in the circumstances it is the only way for the Cuban people to achieve their aspirations for progress through freedom and to do so with our cooperation with other organizations of the member States of the Organization of American States.	No
14073	And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	No
18631	There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.	No
20963	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is disaster.	No
31847	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	No
21592	It happened when I was president.	Yes
18148	Can I respond to that?	No
25749	They see 900 FBI files, a private person, gathered by someone in the White House.	Yes
12599	Do you know today that the Russians broadcast ten times more Spanish programming in Latin America than we did?	Yes
11155	Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	No
21918	No one has been more fortunate than me, all along the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	No
26125	Pam, what the president hasn't told you is that all of his tax cuts expire in 2000, but these increases are going on forever.	Yes
13021	We are on the side of freedom.	No
20341	Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	Yes
8827	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	Yes
14276	And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	No
1530	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	No
19659	But it will cover preexisting conditions.	Yes
3977	So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	No
17483	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	No
881	And I'm very proud of that choice.	No
3714	I know how to do this.	No
19706	We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	Yes
9725	And the plans I've been talking about will create even more.	No
15396	We have had a remarkable success, with the help of a democratic Congress.	No
23380	I'm gonna be a president who believes in science.	No
31962	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	Yes
14626	So let's go back to the harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, my God, Perot, you're tough.	No
24632	We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	No
19248	I've had the best health care in government hospitals, military hospitals, and I know how important it is, but we need to fix it.	No
23728	I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.	No
15494	We've had great success in my own state.	No
640	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva, suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	No
1829	And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	No
4384	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	No
683	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	No
8607	In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.	Yes
2759	The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.	No
13868	We should have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	No
8690	We have to remember that when we talk about a tax reduction, we're just talking about reducing a tax increase, because this administration left us with an integrated tax increase of $86 billion next year.	Yes
19950	It has put an end to the principle that polluters should pay for these toxic waste landfills unless it is very recent.	Yes
21550	I'm making the commitment because I know the Americans want to talk about topics, not tabloid journalism.	No
25058	I will not continue to try to respond to these repetitions of the lies that have already been stated here.	No
30432	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	No
32155	The premiums are too high.	Yes
6875	I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	No
3963	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	No
2516	What I'm doing is the same way Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together a few years ago.	No
16496	On the other hand, when you have a bill of this magnitude, with these many provisions, a chair has to sit down and decide if there is more good than bad.	No
13596	It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	No
8512	The third is the medical care of the elderly, which is linked to social security, which is financed by social security funds.	No
16591	We put in place a simple government structure that could be administered fairly and that was a huge success.	No
18499	Her husband PJ was killed.	No
28169	I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.	No
19797	When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	No
31913	But I have a lot of respect for women.	No
4025	I know what it is when an army is defeated.	No
11242	You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	Yes
3207	So, the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect minority rights as we insisted on the rights of the majority, uh - I think I followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	No
12325	I think that we do.	No
25125	There are forces - and that includes Syria, in my mind - that do not want us to succeed, that do not want such a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominating on its own territory.	No
27759	It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
8917	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the wholesale price index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	Yes
7895	I say that the programs and leadership that failed at the time are not the program and leadership that America needs now.	No
26417	We have lost a lot of jobs in the manufacturing sector in the 12 years before my assumption of the presidency.	Yes
27152	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	No
8504	I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.	Yes
17793	Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	No
13184	As I mentioned a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake of dealing with the dictator to indicate that we are going to make a concession to the point of being armed.	Yes
27602	And for the next decade, she was haunted by this conversation.	No
19486	Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.	Yes
28165	Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	No
8076	This is what I deeply believe.	No
20409	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	No
27398	First of all, the receiver is not something I have proposed.	No
28848	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I am for what I just described to the lady.	No
14519	But it's not my only passion.	No
15384	That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	No
20473	And also inner exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	No
11045	When Senator McCain encouraged the President to travel to Iraq, he suggested that it would be quick and easy, we would be welcomed as liberators.	Yes
13273	He continues, I suppose, on both sides.	No
16843	According to Congressional committees, you need about $10 billion.	Yes
17672	I have avoided, I am afraid, in my previous answer, also the idea of inequality, yes.	No
28847	Are you for it without quotas?	No
1592	But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	Yes
23436	He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	No
19104	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	Yes
10516	This is something the next Secretary of the Treasury will have to work on.	No
6732	It's important that we do that.	No
23746	But we have a very different vision of how to make America stronger and safer.	No
12645	And I don't think this administration has shown foresight, has shown knowledge, has been identified with the great struggle these people are leading to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	No
16650	Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.	No
21875	None of them are ever implemented because -- let me give you an example.	No
2082	What eventually happens is that some people end up not getting help.	No
3288	And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.	No
785	Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	No
1096	And I've told everything I know about it.	No
15178	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	Yes
20093	I wasn't just getting more power and more power.	No
2414	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	No
13012	There's only three left.	Yes
22025	You have a heated debate on these plans.	No
18641	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	No
28984	Remember now that social security revenues exceed spending until 2015.	Yes
17267	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	No
13495	The difficulty, of course, is that we have heavy obligations abroad, so we must not only maintain a favourable trade balance, but also send a large portion of our dollars abroad to pay our troops, maintain our bases and support other economies.	No
3325	Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	No
24412	And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.	Yes
682	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990s and beyond.	No
32628	And we need to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	No
6267	In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	No
16597	When Mr. Nixon took office, for example, we spent three and a half million dollars on the White House and its staff.	Yes
30327	Can they count on us?	No
25040	He's three years old in this administration.	No
15458	All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.	No
12742	Now he must get a better job from his Congress if he will get us the money we need to conduct the foreign affairs of that country in Latin America or elsewhere.	No
6921	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	No
12250	Well, let me start with Texas.	No
20212	I'm gonna put Medicare and social security in a safe and protect them.	No
29300	Will they have income in America?	No
23950	Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	No
27301	For the first time, one State had been the first in all four measures.	Yes
14413	Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.	No
1997	I have my own plan.	No
23904	I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.	No
22449	I was talking about early childhood education for underprivileged little children.	No
22901	Forget all that talk about a draft.	No
283	But, Peter, please understand, the Liberals don't like me talking about Liberals. They don't like it when I say he says he's a cardholder.	No
288	I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	No
1846	But I said that for revenues above $250,000 a year, we should go back to the rates we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created many millionaires to start.	Yes
12572	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	No
29963	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	No
26149	You should expect that from both of us.	No
18219	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	No
13251	Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	Yes
32559	She's talking about health care.	No
27120	And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	No
27298	Grades 4 and 8 students are tested in English and mathematics.	No
6905	Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	No
26565	I don't know a perfect solution.	No
23525	His whole body trembled with the nerve disease, the muscle disease he had.	No
28738	But thank God we have always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to repel the fear of a broken heart and to become deeply involved in the formation of a more perfect union.	No
7887	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	No
19352	And Perot's voters looking for a house should take a look at the Republican file.	No
18751	And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	No
17378	I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	No
17790	If you narrow the social security gap, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	Yes
7508	And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	No
29951	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	No
19868	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	Yes
21737	On any program, and that includes crime, you will find that we have all kinds of big plans around that are never promulgated in the law and implemented.	No
18961	I have a good relationship with Vladimir.	No
13909	Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	No
1980	Well, that's how the bipartite commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested that we should do it, in a way that is balanced with some revenue and some expenditure reductions.	No
6240	"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	No
18197	My administration has worked with Congress to create the Department of Internal Security so that we can better coordinate our borders and ports.	Yes
29555	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	No
12766	America has gained by maintaining the dignity, decency that has characterized us, and that is what maintains America's prestige, not by running to America as Senator Kennedy has brought it down.	No
19110	And I look forward to discussing how we're going to do it.	No
34194	If they did it by surprise...	No
33457	People are going to pour into our country.	No
21018	Too many people have been left behind.	No
939	I want to continue this expansion.	No
123	But I hope you don't take my five seconds off.	No
22802	Sorry, the time for diplomacy is over.	No
29517	Who negotiates these trade agreements?	No
6068	This is a terribly painful situation for the Americans.	No
29913	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	No
14715	That is my commitment to you.	No
19907	Now, the reason they don't have, the reason why the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	No
12303	That's not how I would have done it.	No
18519	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse war, never, with warriors.	No
30154	Just -- would you like to hear...	No
4231	We want to work with the Russians.	No
16556	I am opposed to a general grace of military crooks or deserters.	No
16966	It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	No
8952	And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	Yes
11365	And I ask the American people to give me another opportunity and I will rest on my file, but I will also tell you, when times are hard, we need a firm hand to the slab and the great honour of my life was always to put my country first.	No
24298	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	Yes
29634	And, indeed, I have met many people who have been hardened by you and your businesses, Donald.	No
26628	Now none of that will happen anymore.	No
17494	It was a good instinct.	No
33959	And we will continue to work to help Haiti...	No
5899	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	No
2483	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	No
6507	We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	No
16753	In the field of nuclear energy, we have increased research and development, under the aegis of the Energy Research and Development Agency, in a very substantial way, to ensure that our nuclear power plants are safer, more efficient and that we have adequate safeguards.	Yes
21486	I don't want to --	No
25786	We don't talk about it.	No
3749	Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.	No
16635	I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	Yes
8412	I am in favour of that because I believe it is the best way to help our schools without risking the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	No
23148	That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.	No
20091	He's president, so I guess it's a little better.	No
28102	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency care, we're going to have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to the OB/GYN.	No
2380	And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	Yes
8934	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	No
21937	Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	No
2095	Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	Yes
1461	One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	No
7831	This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.	No
32647	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	No
850	As far as the ridiculous thing is concerned, George, you're winning a gold medal.	No
1978	And the way we do it is $2.50 for each cup, we are asking for $1 more, paid, as I mentioned earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
30316	It is also important that we look at the whole world situation.	No
16893	They have too many employees.	No
15245	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	Yes
17035	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	No
29001	Under my plan, it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you are 100 years old.	No
22820	The military's job is to win the war.	No
1422	But do you realize that over the last ten years, it is a higher than average growth over this ten-year period?	Yes
17820	And the flow of imports into this country is flooding the American people.	No
8937	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	Yes
25273	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	No
5911	And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	No
10523	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described, rescue, when I think it's rescue, because -- because of greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	Yes
163	And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	No
17520	I'm just saying that I think that's where the effort must be directed -- to make that determination.	No
22040	To get the interest rates down.	No
6020	At present, because of previous agreements, some of President Clinton's goods and products we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, are -- there is a billion dollars that we -- our companies have paid so far to put our goods there.	Yes
21821	To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	No
588	And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	No
26196	My entire administration is talking about your future.	No
8035	I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	No
20392	All seniors are covered by prescription drugs in my plan.	Yes
89	I asked for and received the same briefing.	No
32543	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	No
105	Yes, I've been very specific about that, John.	No
4353	We seem to come full circle again.	No
21591	We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.	Yes
2352	I'll make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- our market and our business, because I want to bring home and get good jobs.	No
16455	Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	Yes
1720	So all of this is possible.	No
784	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the western side of the Gulf?	No
10095	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	No
16886	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	No
16094	And I made good proposals.	No
285	I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	No
5970	"By the way, when Senator Obama said that he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canadians said, ""Yes, and we will sell our oil to China."""	Yes
18349	There are summits in progress.	No
16810	And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	Yes
13382	And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	Yes
13090	I do not want it because it is an involvement that the Republicans have been happy to trigger and, therefore, would lead this nation to war.	No
21850	It means keeping the government out of this.	No
3307	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	No
24367	The Administration was the first major country to resist the abuse of Tiananmen Square.	Yes
12611	What system, communism or freedom, will triumph over the next five or ten years?	No
12773	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	No
27300	And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.	Yes
28445	I also need the next leader to be patient.	No
1018	But we don't need to have - the growth of spending that will throw the lid and add to the problems of inflation.	No
28251	Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	Yes
14705	I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	No
12636	I believe that this struggle will continue, and it may well be decided over the next decade.	No
15891	I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	No
1839	"And now, five weeks before the election, he says his big bold idea is, ""Anything."""	No
12988	We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	Yes
970	We have the opportunity to work together to build this future, to build a better America, to build a better America, because the best America does not hide.	No
32598	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	Yes
21824	They cover 98% of their population and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, just like Rochester, New York.	Yes
29688	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often where people live, what kind of education they can get in their public schools, and, yes, it determines how they are treated in the criminal justice system.	Yes
13798	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	Yes
3515	I do not think that they are.	No
2952	In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.	Yes
11768	And I think there is a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there should be changes in the IMF.	No
7806	We must let them know that the great American ideals - independence, the right of people to be free and the right to progress - are ideals that are not ours alone, but all of us.	No
8575	That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.	Yes
8152	I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	No
10160	What I think the American people would like to understand, it has been investigated to some extent, but -- but the administration has exercised the executive privilege of preventing all information from coming out.	Yes
7198	The president denied his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	Yes
26988	Russia continues to fight us at the UN on many occasions.	Yes
1422	But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	Yes
27924	You said we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
6549	This costs the government $7,700 per family.	Yes
25016	"But I'm not going to pick one and, in advance, say hypothetically, ""Oh, yes, we'll send troops there."""	No
15621	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	No
11166	... to -- to -- to... to...	No
565	But it didn't stop him from approving the sale of arms to the ayatollah.	No
18480	There was a good way to disarm him and a bad way.	No
14955	I'm sure it can be done and it's going to reduce inflation because I did it in California.	Yes
2305	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	No
1066	They wondered how an elected representative could serve them and participate in such activities in the United States Congress.	No
25591	And you have the right to know where we're taking this country if you decide to elect us.	No
33343	I don't want to tear families apart.	No
27404	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and we have fewer ships than in 1916.	Yes
14891	The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	Yes
29944	And I could tell how much it bothered him and bothered him that it was imputed and used against him.	No
11821	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	No
3221	Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	No
7458	"""I said, ""OK, you have a deal."	No
25136	In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	Yes
7477	But I can take it.	No
1409	So, I would say that someone in Judge Stevens' format would be the kind of individual I would choose in the future, as I did in the past.	No
25123	But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	Yes
17222	The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	Yes
20935	This is how you determine whether children are progressing towards excellence.	No
27093	Then he went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do anything.	No
5725	It doesn't make me popular with the teachers' union.	No
1766	On government land, your administration has halved the number of permits and licences.	Yes
23416	And the way I pay for that -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is that I step back the tax cut that this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him, me and Charlie.	Yes
6980	Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.	No
1082	Now that two Congressional committees have participated in this investigation, both committees have largely approved me, and the House and Senate have done the same.	No
20702	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	No
3176	In terms of respect for our own people for our own government, in terms of participating in the development of concepts and commitments, in terms of our country's confidence among the nations of the world, in terms of our country's dependence on the needs and obligations we have expressed to our allies, in terms of respect for our country, even among our potential opponents, we are weak.	No
1463	Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	No
16845	The DISC, as you said, was about $1.4 billion.	Yes
6932	I think that government-led health will lead to poor health, lead to rationing, lead to fewer choices.	No
9891	People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.	No
27231	We have reduced our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we have developed oil and natural gas.	Yes
25229	For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	Yes
3356	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	No
12916	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	No
403	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	No
15285	There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	Yes
29190	We do not know what we are doing with regard to devaluations and all these countries around the world, especially China.	No
14923	Mr Ellis, I think that this idea which has been generated here in our country that inflation has somehow come upon us as a plague and therefore it is uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is quite misleading and it is dangerous to say that to the people.	No
33357	But I want to put our resources where I think they are most needed: to get rid of any violent person.	No
13966	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	Yes
2242	We need to reduce the cost of healthcare, not just Medicare and Medicaid...	No
32443	As soon as I have -- first, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
29430	Well, I'm really asking for important jobs, because the rich are going to create huge jobs.	No
25068	Mr President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to strong national defence.	No
25864	What service are you in?	No
23678	"And in a war, there's a lot -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say, ""He shouldn't have done that."""	No
31941	So, yeah, that's what Donald Trump is.	No
23471	I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	No
5810	That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.	No
21342	Let me just mention three things very quickly.	No
32488	It's a big difference in itself.	No
18896	And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	Yes
2316	You had loan agents -- who gave loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because people weren't eligible.	Yes
7690	Secondly, as an executive leader.	No
17008	Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	No
7851	One of them is the old program, such as education assistance.	No
83	And we begin with drug education and prevention in the early years of primary education in all primary schools in our state, and that is the kind of effort we need in all primary schools in the United States of America.	No
889	Well, we obviously have a difference.	No
25139	I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	Yes
12088	We believe in tough love.	No
18821	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we displaced them.	Yes
24605	I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.	No
6850	Let me give you a prime example.	No
19279	So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	No
19995	I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	No
2872	After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.	Yes
9064	We can meet our destiny - and this destiny to build here a land that will, for all humanity, be a brilliant city on a hill.	No
15227	We export more coal this year than any year of history.	Yes
13186	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	No
8823	Or we passed a bill a few weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - half a billion dollars.	Yes
27374	I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	No
362	We must begin to return to the construction and rehabilitation of housing for low-income and moderate-income families in this country; housing for young families they can look forward to one day buying.	No
3309	That's what the Americans want.	No
25808	Number one, add another million children to the Medicaid ranks.	No
19696	We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	No
33150	I have major disagreements with my opponent on these and other issues that will be before the Supreme Court.	No
29622	Our country has huge problems.	No
598	And all these things have happened because the Philippines aspires to democracy.	No
18876	But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.	No
25318	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	No
11220	I said, look at Ukraine.	No
19997	Nor would I want to be a Liberal, Mr President, but you're stuck with that because it's your record, it's your record in Arkansas: the biggest tax increase in history.	Yes
16068	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was a remarkable Chief Justice and I think most Americans are doing it too.	No
22411	I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	No
3543	Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	No
23331	Look at the record of the man running for the president.	No
19312	I thought it was wrong.	No
27983	I'm bringing people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	No
33793	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	Yes
2897	I have been someone who loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe there is no limit to what we can be in the future, if we can exploit the enormous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	No
1963	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
21798	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	No
23010	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	No
31909	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	No
16454	Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	No
15163	Yeah, I'd love to.	No
25466	In other words, a president must make choices.	No
16922	And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	No
7153	I'm going to fight my teeth and nails to get the minimum wage.	No
7860	Actually, Mr. Nixon talked about it a week ago in a speech.	No
33412	Very unfair that someone crosses the border, becomes a citizen, according to his plan, you have open borders.	Yes
6696	A family of four totalling $40,000 received tax relief of approximately $1,700.	Yes
8115	But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	No
22612	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	No
23834	I want to make this change to the American people.	No
3096	The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	Yes
10551	On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	Yes
21639	But we're investing a much lower percentage of our revenues in the things you've just asked for all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth will decrease as a result.	Yes
2214	They have the choice -- and they will have at least two plans that will be completely free of charge to them.	No
13982	That's what I mean tonight.	No
16532	The current bureaucratic structure of the federal government is a disorder.	No
32380	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	Yes
22033	Everybody knows how to fix them.	No
10560	What you're interested in is trying to understand, how will it influence you?	No
6977	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	Yes
14306	We have, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	No
33793	"And the day I was in the situation room, watching the raid that led Osama bin Laden to justice, he welcomed the ""Apprenticeship to Celebrity""."	Yes
8589	But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.	No
14031	I suggest that the main problem -- a country spent $400 million on lobbying in 1988, our country.	Yes
16924	But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	No
22556	Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	Yes
4031	She asked me, can you please make sure that another mother doesn't go through what I'm going through?	No
21084	A promise made will be a promise kept.	No
1995	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have caught him.	No
5839	And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	No
12833	Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	No
20050	See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	No
33100	And that's why I hope that people will take care of it themselves so that they can see that, yes, I spent 30 years, actually a little more, working to help children and families.	No
10516	That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	No
20514	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	No
26944	The right path for us is to ensure that we continue the - the people who are the leaders of these various anti-American groups and these - these jihadists, but also to help the Muslim world.	No
1029	If they know that they will help to make decisions and will not be excluded from being a party involved in the national objective.	No
11563	IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	No
93	It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	Yes
441	And I favor the death penalty.	No
29117	How are we going to do this?	No
15396	We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	No
9302	And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	No
12925	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	Yes
24274	Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.	No
15239	With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Air Quality Act.	Yes
17652	We found that those who reached 185 per cent of the poverty level received government benefits.	Yes
18517	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	No
14470	Now, in 1984 they were told.	No
22120	The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	Yes
1081	I said under oath that the initiative I took was at the request of the members of the Banking and Currency Committee of the House of Commons on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and an appropriate response on my part.	Yes
33193	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	No
10639	Do you know that Senator Obama voted in favour -- is he now proposing $860 billion in new spending?	Yes
8191	Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	No
20338	I don't think he'll do it because under his plan, if you calculate the $100 billion figures from Medicare just for the 1% richest of the tax reduction.	Yes
24038	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	No
16098	I don't want to see the federal government tell the communities, well, you can't do it anymore.	No
266	"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	No
2641	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	No
17966	And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	No
24456	Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption.	Yes
69	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	No
22254	There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	No
12866	We first received the support of the Administration, then we did not, and we were defeated by a vote in the Senate.	Yes
34107	So I said, look, we need to keep an eye on ISIS.	No
14961	One of these ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year Governor Reagan said that the main cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	Yes
21231	It's my past as governor of Texas, that's how I behave if I have the chance to win your vote as president of the United States.	No
3569	So my attitude is that we need to grow the economy from the bottom up.	No
16407	And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	No
16037	One I don't have a list yet.	No
1041	I know I'm ready.	No
17848	I'm not going to, because I think all of you -- or not all of you, those people who are in these pockets of poverty and who haven't caught up, they couldn't answer as I would like -- but I think most of the people in this country would say, yes, they're better than they were four years ago.	No
33279	And using this kind of fear rhetoric is simply terribly unfortunate.	No
16343	And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.	No
19410	We've submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	Yes
17150	And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.	Yes
13897	And let me say that.	No
2662	That's because I care about education for all our children.	No
1070	We were celebrating our bicentenary, and I find that there is a movement while I travel in the country of greater interest in this campaign.	No
8956	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	No
30276	We are not - we do not respect other countries.	No
17556	In 1981, I think he paid about 40% of taxes.	Yes
3327	And in November 1975, I was the first president to order the executive to take positive measures, measures, through the Commerce Department and other departments of the Cabinet, to ensure that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	Yes
10830	"So let's -- let's get the American people to say, ""Fix it for us."""	No
17700	I think they are asking for new and creative ways of trying to do this with everyone involved.	No
34025	I'm not looking at anything now.	No
23592	I don't think we need a good Conservative judge, and I don't think we need a good Liberal judge.	No
17998	Free nations will help us to achieve the peace we all want.	No
19927	We have declining crime rates, two million fewer people on social assistance lists prior to the adoption of social assistance reform, and a 50 per cent increase in child support and a criminal bill with 60 death sentences and 100,000 police officers and the prohibition of weapons of aggression.	Yes
7284	And prosecutions are up about 68 percent -- I think -- is the number.	Yes
20324	No prescription drugs, no pharmacotherapy, no preventive drugs, no eye care.	No
25745	I appreciate the quote from the young man.	No
9288	That's not the right course for America.	No
16111	That is absolutely not true.	No
2628	So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	Yes
33375	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
6176	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	Yes
10542	At the moment, credit markets are frozen and what this means, in practice, is that small businesses and some large companies cannot obtain loans.	Yes
26582	Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	No
13224	Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	No
14703	They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.	No
22034	There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	No
15608	(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	No
22131	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	No
27673	And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	Yes
29048	There is a difference between the great federal government and someone from outside Washington who will trust individuals.	No
2747	If I'm president, I'll create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	No
24137	But it's a good program.	No
14492	All those specific examples that I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like this, they'd lead you up to the door.	No
30142	Now you're talking about getting ISIS out.	No
34142	What do we need that for?	No
31994	But it is things that people say.	No
34050	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	No
3451	So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	No
18814	We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	Yes
1420	Let me talk about the economic announcements that were made last week.	No
5848	That's what I'd say.	No
19513	And, I could add, with democratic Russia.	Yes
163	And the formula I gave you works, we put it through a good economic model, we have good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein there who is a highly respected economist in Massachusetts.	No
2586	And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	No
11557	The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	No
23509	And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	No
18430	First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.	Yes
17348	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favour the approach I'm talking about.	No
26373	He still thinks it's a mistake.	No
24667	I will have a unique mandate.	No
12059	It's really a matter of culture.	No
12390	And so I think it's a problem.	No
16466	We could also help our young people with certain proposals that would give young people the opportunity to work and learn at the same time as giving us money to young people who go to university.	No
23089	And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.	Yes
22948	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	No
10271	The problem is they'll be in china.	No
16317	I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	No
32895	She has a huge hate.	No
233	I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.	No
4305	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	No
16791	I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.	No
7437	I will continue, within four years, to try to do so.	No
13772	I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	Yes
24906	A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	No
32538	Its donors have made massive tax savings.	Yes
3097	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	Yes
17149	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	Yes
24467	And I just think we should do everything we can to respect the American family.	No
11582	I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	No
19192	More than what you spend on food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	Yes
33328	Now, I want to build the wall.	No
20676	And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	No
22968	I'm gonna change that.	No
4149	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	No
28055	However, it takes a different style of leadership to do so.	No
13543	Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.	No
19623	We have to be firm and strong.	No
34131	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	Yes
23139	There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	No
8582	If we do not agree, we would use the means to make the most of our economy.	No
21046	I can't let this man go on with fuzzy maths.	No
12391	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	No
21233	I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.	No
15522	If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	No
5978	So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	No
25156	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	Yes
19474	You talk about the Brady Bill.	No
8036	But it didn't mean that.	No
24768	So we don't have the best.	No
7344	I met the Black Congress caucus in the White House.	No
21235	I finally want to do something about social security.	No
24653	It's a matter of life and death.	No
21661	These people are hurting in the city centres.	No
22243	By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	No
24452	I have seen the family values of all those people in America who kill themselves by working harder for less in a country that has had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	Yes
27670	It's -- it's an important part of the world for us.	No
12800	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	No
32969	Donald gave the names of some people he would consider.	No
232	The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.	No
25517	And that would be a severe blow to our capabilities there in the Pacific.	No
18748	As far as North Korea is concerned, the real story is: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	Yes
23524	And this man arose, and he trembled.	No
8247	I know that Senator Kennedy is as deeply concerned about these issues as I am, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America, but only about how to achieve those goals.	No
16675	Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	No
20740	I think it needs to be removed from the budget and protected.	No
12259	The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	Yes
15502	And I am pleased that Congress has proposed this drug bill and has finally called for it to concern these drug kingpin narcotics.	No
19827	So it seems to me that we should take this money that we can save from the Ministry of Education, put it in opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to go to school because we're going to match what the state is offering, and you're going to go to school of your choice.	No
16358	This is not the kind of administration we need.	No
2644	You put $90 billion in green jobs.	Yes
17870	Today, we are well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	Yes
33630	But they have to pay.	No
2756	You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	No
33544	...proclaimed more countries to get them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
3156	Mr. Ford, once again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, insisted that this reprocessing or rather this enrichment be done by private industry and not by existing government facilities.	Yes
11008	Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	No
22315	There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.	Yes
21790	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	No
25531	But this administration, on many occasions, has lost its way in this area.	No
30250	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	No
21763	We have to do something.	No
913	Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.	Yes
19377	Mr Lehrer, I hope we have a chance to discuss drugs later in the programme.	No
1175	I think that should indicate the kind of leadership I would choose to help if I was elected.	No
15501	You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	No
18110	Their hope is that we will get tired and leave.	No
17131	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists predict that we are moving towards a very slow period of growth because the economy is declining and could be a recession.	No
26353	And according to Investors Daily, which I read a few days ago, 88 percent of the people for whom he is applying for credits are already covered by collective agreements or other agreements.	Yes
21099	There are $2.3 trillion in surplus that we can use to ensure that young workers have a social security plan in the future.	Yes
24407	American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.	Yes
7084	And we should not trample these people in front of them in the line.	No
513	Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	No
24075	I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	No
20503	As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	No
618	I hope it's not Christmas when you make that decision.	No
15178	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents have tried to pass the SALT treaty - which puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was in the 90% of a treaty that we could agree with when he left his post, is categorically against this SALT treaty.	Yes
1493	As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	Yes
15117	I have not heard any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	Yes
10221	It was the United States of America.	No
22494	I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	Yes
23038	One of them is to speed up the marketing of generic medicines more quickly.	No
21840	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want these outrageous requests to be capped.	Yes
11419	It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.	No
3281	On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	Yes
13031	In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	No
15636	I repeat, a few days after you made this commitment, you broke it; you said, well, perhaps as a last resort that we will.	Yes
30276	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	No
21969	I'll tell you how it affected me.	No
33655	... that's offshore back into the country.	No
15569	So I'm pledged to do that.	No
27811	But the president mentioned the automobile industry and that in one way or another I would be in favour of a job elsewhere.	Yes
11602	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think, retrospectively, there are some that we should take very, very seriously.	No
14583	That's what I'm worried about...	No
8603	Second, the Vice-President mentioned medical care for the elderly.	No
32405	And believe me, they don't do it to get me elected.	No
9666	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	No
12998	America has not been standing still.	No
14135	I wouldn't want to, but I wouldn't get away from it.	No
30330	I intend to be a leader in our country on which people can rely, both here and around the world, to make decisions that will promote peace and prosperity, but also to resist the tyrants, whether they are abroad or at home.	No
24823	I would like to thank the people who started with Mr. Perot who came to help our campaign.	No
28404	If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.	No
6537	And there's no system.	No
12761	We obtained more votes to condemn Hungary and to examine this situation than last year.	Yes
17615	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	Yes
3994	And we've got a choice.	No
23778	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	No
2316	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	Yes
8259	Mr. Nixon is leaving the Republican party.	No
18749	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	Yes
27	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	No
17397	All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	Yes
3224	In the north, they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained and well-equipped soldiers - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	Yes
18039	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	Yes
24285	And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	No
2792	Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	No
16447	Another very important aspect of our economy would be to increase production in all possible ways, to retain taxes on individuals, and to shift tax charges to those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	No
24570	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	No
20201	In fact, I did not question Governor Bush's experience.	No
29200	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	Yes
8355	His experience has been different from mine.	No
6458	Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.	No
23298	Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	No
28363	This is a big spender.	No
19481	But let's look at the facts here.	No
25253	I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	No
20563	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	No
6321	And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	No
21714	I'm fighting for changes in the rule of exclusion, so if an honest cop arrests someone and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't leave.	No
32472	I wish you would have done this.	No
1688	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	No
33754	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	No
3044	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	No
4377	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	No
33381	By the way...	No
19775	He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.	No
25614	Please join me in this cause to move forward with confidence and with a sense of confidence and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	No
20062	I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	No
33233	So I'm very honored by all of that.	No
8875	And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	No
25058	I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	No
26072	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world for me.	No
21674	That's something I can do.	No
12926	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	Yes
3554	This one's kind of old.	No
19941	I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.	No
10954	Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	Yes
24467	And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	No
8701	Recycling these products, then returning to the pockets of American workers by reducing their tax payments.	No
19734	I supported the President when I thought he was right about Bosnia.	Yes
20530	I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	Yes
28584	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	No
26453	Now, I have a little time left, so let me say that I am being attacked so many times on these issues; it is difficult to answer these questions.	No
21306	And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.	No
12615	By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?	No
3900	We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	No
25496	Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.	No
27927	I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	No
14660	The whole world has had economic problems.	No
18358	Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	Yes
28082	They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	Yes
29514	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	No
16089	And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.	No
20793	We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.	No
16261	I'm worried about what it does for our future.	No
22619	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	No
24847	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	Yes
1287	I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	No
1544	The American people are healed, are working together.	No
21611	But there's going to be a new Congress.	No
13465	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	No
26371	We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	Yes
23188	We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	Yes
12025	An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.	No
32336	And we have to do our part.	No
7812	We must defend our ideals.	No
7713	I hope that such an incident will not occur.	No
27751	We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	No
28780	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	No
7980	Now there are people who are going to go to bed hungry in the United States - much less, by the way, than going to bed hungry when we came to power at the end of the Truman administration.	No
13160	But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.	No
25516	And there's all the evidence, all the indications that this government would be hostile to the United States.	No
3690	We need to do this now, because it will make our businesses and families better.	No
6458	Now, how to achieve this is the most critical component of it.	No
26292	The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	Yes
16404	I want to build on that.	No
2639	Okay, I'm not gonna cut the funding for education.	No
7792	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	No
12821	I think it's time they fish or cut bait.	No
29600	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	Yes
16888	We also see that, over the past four years, the number of employees hired by Congress has increased substantially, much more than the gross national product, much more than any other increase in our society.	Yes
20384	That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.	No
11768	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	No
20848	Four, let's say if you get federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth year.	No
28492	And that means keeping our military strong.	No
29320	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	Yes
1591	Before that, the family could own a house.	Yes
1493	In fact, I think when Gallup conducted his first survey in December 1975, they did not put my name on the list.	Yes
24354	That's their response to this kind of action.	No
18816	We will be more committed over time to helping.	No
1505	I think a lot of that depends on the current situation, sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes internal affairs.	No
28901	I swore to abide by the laws of my state.	No
24551	The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.	No
8341	Over the years, I have served on the National Security Council.	No
32147	If he wants to start, he can start.	No
10025	And number three, we're going to find out who did this and we're going to track them down, because one of the things I said throughout my presidency is when people make fun of the Americans, we're chasing them.	No
12257	And people are willing to invest capital in brown fields don't want to do it for fear of a lawsuit.	No
28498	You know, we've won this conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	Yes
32175	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	No
13127	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	No
24802	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	No
13023	But we are not going to advance America and we will not be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex on American achievements.	No
28445	I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	No
11329	I came from very modest means.	No
20840	But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	No
24849	And I think the biggest dividend of these difficult calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	No
18610	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	No
18600	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	No
12326	It is pollution, carbon dioxide and other chemicals that are even more powerful, but in smaller quantities, that are the cause.	Yes
29702	We need to restore confidence.	No
22812	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	No
2149	Thus, the way to deal with health insurance in particular is to reduce the costs of health care.	No
678	And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.	No
12518	Who threatens freedom in the world?	No
10020	I know these people and I know their families.	No
2171	We're going to give a better prescription program.	No
21226	Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	No
16126	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	No
23986	What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.	No
15194	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it is said in a quiet voice.	No
8072	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	No
22143	Coming out of World War II it made sense.	No
22572	The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
10948	I don't think that's the kind of change we need.	No
20470	We may not find many of them tonight, so I wanted to point out.	No
15636	I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	Yes
8456	Well as you take the bills -	No
25228	Different people with different views fight with each other.	No
12803	I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	No
23150	They create government-sponsored health care.	Yes
10917	And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.	No
11668	I'm afraid I'm too much to hire our military around the world.	No
13196	The way to war is always paved with good intentions.	No
12202	That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	Yes
27042	But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	No
793	And let me say that, everything he can talk about, he's going around Noriega.	No
8071	"And so I believe that we must ask the people to decide not simply on the basis of: ""Voice as your grandfather did; vote as your mother did."""	No
28487	Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	No
18118	However, he does not want the American leaders to send mixed signals, not to stand with the Iraqi people.	No
11881	We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	No
23023	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	No
8205	What has happened to you?	No
261	He introduced or supported a law at the time that suggested that the children of Massachusetts should be exempted from going abroad in this war.	Yes
20296	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	No
15912	Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?	No
27584	I see our influence diminished, partly because of the President's inability to face our economic challenges in our country; partly because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it should be; partly because of the unrest with Israel.	No
12991	More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	Yes
27927	I met them at Appleton, Wisconsin.	No
28734	We need to change it.	No
24109	You see, I don't think we need to impose more and spend more, and then say it's gonna make the problem better.	No
25073	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	No
22422	I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	No
6787	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	No
24074	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have to spend.	Yes
26029	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	No
16998	The government must be well managed, efficient, economic, we must have a government responsive to the needs of our people - to those who are poor, who do not have adequate health care, who have been deceived too long with our tax programs, who have been unemployed, whose families have been torn apart.	No
2605	My own opinion, by the way, is that I added to that.	No
1912	Number two, let's look at history.	No
6529	It doesn't work for the American family.	No
32874	And what he said about African-Americans and Latinos, Muslims, prisoners of war, immigrants, people with disabilities, he never apologized.	Yes
12827	Well, the conditions I set out in one of our previous televised debates, and it is quite difficult to be much more precise than that.	No
17854	If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.	No
13736	I think it was pretty impressive.	No
25681	Let me give you a sports update first.	No
13938	I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?	No
16677	We estimate that these programs would add a minimum of $100 billion and probably a maximum of $200 billion each year to the federal budget.	Yes
25913	We didn't have the cuts that the president promised he would do and then he doubled.	Yes
12760	Let us consider the vote on Hungary.	No
17992	We continue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	No
29250	Donald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	Yes
13621	And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	No
32154	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	No
32427	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	No
291	"I don't want to see child pornography laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" coming out of our currency."	No
17845	"I asked, ""Are you better than you were four years ago?"""	No
34345	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	Yes
25093	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	No
20037	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that, I have not understood all of this, as the President knows.	No
33371	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	No
26733	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	No
7581	Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	No
25819	We should reduce growth to twice the rate of inflation.	No
32964	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	No
8071	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	No
29693	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	No
18506	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and we must spread freedom because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred, tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	No
25235	You must be hard and smart.	No
19411	We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	Yes
9679	I don't think so, Candy.	No
3437	And, number four, we need to make sure that we help the owners, because the fundamental problem here is the seizures that take place across the country.	No
20657	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
22613	But 9/11 changed it all.	No
8953	And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.	Yes
33874	She lied hundreds of times to the people, Congress and the FBI.	Yes
3508	And I promise you this will happen.	No
8148	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	No
23650	Well, once again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against that, my opponent is against that.	No
9489	He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	No
9824	It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	Yes
1536	The American people had lost faith, confidence and confidence in the presidency itself.	No
8028	But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.	No
30363	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	Yes
8043	We should not force our nationalist allies to leave them and give them to the communists.	No
18204	And the enemy must be right only once to hurt us.	No
19528	But let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans into the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were stuck for eight hours, the rangers.	Yes
19919	And you know this liberal accusation, that's what their party always hangs out when they're in a tight race.	No
16713	We need to shift from oil to coal.	No
7010	The president decided to give it to the richest Americans in a tax reduction.	Yes
30432	But it is certainly not a good thing that she did.	No
7671	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	No
1476	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	No
13007	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talk about our record and the precedent.	No
26818	But beyond that, we must tackle the economy.	No
21346	Our competitors don't do that.	No
18723	Before being sworn in, the government's policy was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	Yes
24585	I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	No
946	And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	No
16707	The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	Yes
20553	It's very clear to me.	No
16348	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	No
1241	It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.	No
25573	I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	No
21765	And so I prefer, strongly, the term limits.	No
30233	He even said, well, you know, if there was a nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, it's good...	Yes
20615	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	No
22804	He rushed into war without a plan to win peace.	No
32089	And I will be honest, I am so disappointed by the Members, including the Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	No
472	I don't think it's enough to come in front of the Americans looking at us tonight and say, well, I haven't settled it.	No
21614	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	No
28639	Every day is earth day if you own the land.	No
8354	As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.	No
32477	We're getting rid of the interest provisions.	Yes
9603	And this is an example of the kind of advocacy we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinner.	No
34264	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	Yes
14177	One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	Yes
25162	First of all, Mr. Mondale must know that the President of the United States did not order the marines to enter that barracks.	Yes
3136	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	No
2944	And let me cite several examples.	No
352	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	No
24015	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is, for 40 years, we've been keeping peace.	Yes
24073	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon of taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and create jobs.	Yes
11840	I think these crimes are different.	No
14542	Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	Yes
33606	So, the plan I have, I think, will actually create more opportunities.	No
25948	My brother probably died in part because of cigarettes.	No
25368	But deterrence - and that is why it is - is also what led me to propose what is now called the Star Wars concept, but we propose that we seek to see if there is not a defensive weapon that could defend itself against incoming missiles.	No
32865	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	No
31913	But I have tremendous respect for women.	No
8023	He leaves a hundred kilometers between the sea.	No
25388	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	No
21545	So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	No
30312	It is essential that America's word be good.	No
17814	And the result is exactly what we see.	No
14256	And in 12 years as governor, I guess I've taken all the interest groups that there was in my state at some point to fight for change.	Yes
12881	They want to be free.	No
3058	And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	No
11729	It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	No
23504	This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	No
26202	Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.	No
3021	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
11836	And I think racial profiling is part of a broader question of how we treat race in America.	No
20810	If you are a single mother who earns $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you earn, you pay a marginal rate higher on that dollar than someone who earns more than $200,000 a year, and that's not fair.	Yes
22136	We must have our staff at work.	No
18336	What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	No
728	I'm going to do full research, move on as fast as we can.	No
2929	With respect to the meeting with Congress, during the twenty-four months I was the President of the United States, I did better than one meeting a month with leading groups or congressional commissions - in the House and Senate.	Yes
841	And I'd like each of you to say whether I've come to conclusions as a result of such scandalous and brutal rumours.	No
32342	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	No
9246	But what I said, too, is that we cannot only produce a traditional energy source.	No
22773	And Europeans didn't like this decision.	No
3264	I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	No
20120	And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	Yes
20940	Start asking the question, what do you know?	No
18798	I also think that's -- one of the reasons we can't do that is because we're overly over-stretched.	No
23204	We have discovered today that over the past 13 months, we have added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.	Yes
18098	And that is why it is essential that we have strong alliances, and we do so.	No
3374	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	No
9703	President Obama was right, he said, it was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	Yes
2889	The Naval Academy, the first military graduate since Eisenhower.	No
17131	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	No
25139	I have just signed a bill to strengthen our ability to deal with this terrorist problem with our allies.	Yes
3710	We now have defence systems that the costs are completely out of control.	Yes
17157	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	Yes
8722	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	Yes
20023	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	No
3831	The next President of the United States will not have to consider whether or not we have gone to Iraq.	No
3347	I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	No
13251	Now, following our firm stance, the civil war has ended; and today, at least in southern Indochina, the communists have moved and we have a strong and free stronghold there.	Yes
25407	Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	No
25882	I mean, we cut defence spending too much in the first place.	Yes
29939	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	Yes
16597	When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	Yes
27954	And I proposed a plan to ensure that we bring manufacturing jobs back to our coasts by rewarding businesses and small businesses that invest here, not abroad.	Yes
22969	And I'm going to put in place a better internal security effort.	No
9271	Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	Yes
5578	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	No
32363	She just spent about 25 seconds over her time.	No
18973	It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	No
24555	And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	No
30247	That's not true.	No
7410	Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.	No
11766	I think we need to reform the IMF.	No
34035	But I think they'll see through it.	No
23900	I think character is a very important issue.	No
33228	In Chicago, where firearms laws are the toughest in the United States, it could probably be said by far that they are more violent than any other city.	Yes
34182	This is what we have to do.	No
186	But we have to keep moving without killing the engine and throwing people out of work.	No
25817	We've always had at least 7 percent.	Yes
22729	I know how these people think.	No
9020	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	Yes
12841	Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	No
9742	And I think that's a mistake.	No
16749	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	No
24573	I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	No
106	And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	Yes
471	It's as simple as that.	No
1026	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	No
8208	We note that the prices you pay have increased five times more in the Truman administration than in the Eisenhower administration.	Yes
1265	I struggled for, and Congress eventually followed a general revenue-sharing program, whereby cities and states, two thirds and states, one third, get more than $6 billion a year in cash, through which they can provide a lot, a lot of services, what they really want.	Yes
7254	They didn't see their service as a draft.	No
21240	I don't want to be the policeman of the world, I want to be the peacemaker of the world with a high morale army and a well-equipped army.	No
19983	It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	No
14517	But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	Yes
3049	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	No
23177	We got him out of the House of Representatives.	Yes
15428	In each case, I alone had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	No
23416	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	Yes
25707	Again, I will say that I will do my best to make it a discussion of ideas and questions, not insults.	No
13952	When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.	No
10390	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	No
24022	We simply cannot pull back.	No
34243	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	No
4090	That's what we have to do.	No
20350	Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	No
17384	We've got, like, a third of what it was.	Yes
7651	And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	Yes
29411	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	No
23150	They create government-sponsored health care.	Yes
28044	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think the situation you're describing is completely out of reach.	No
20998	My attitude is you haven't seen anything yet.	No
25826	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	No
14711	More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	Yes
10052	I think these actions of a president and leader have symbolic meaning and perhaps even material meaning in that you hope that during this period we could call people who were actually eyewitnesses.	No
5891	Again, while you were on the board of directors of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, sent $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
25833	But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	Yes
24613	It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	No
24327	National security, economic strength, democracy.	No
19186	Well, I guess some may be better off.	No
3067	Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	No
19342	That's what President Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	Yes
18019	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	Yes
25381	"Now, are you going to sit with us and get rid of these nuclear weapons once and for all, and free humanity from this threat?"""	No
13321	Mr McGee, I am planning a speech on this next week.	No
20131	I think a lot of people deserve the credit and I've tried to give it to them.	No
13956	I just have an honest philosophical difference.	No
29053	I want to have the military keeping the peace.	No
22450	And let me tell you a specific pilot program where kids who don't have a chance to go to this program when they're 3 years old.	No
15892	And I said, what can we do about it.	No
8550	Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	Yes
2972	We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	Yes
8592	Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	No
15573	Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	No
8158	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	No
1395	Once the search and analysis procedure has been completed, and once I have been given a list of the top five or seven or ten people in the country, I will make a selection of these people.	No
8066	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	No
30340	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	Yes
24360	So I would be firm.	No
34170	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	Yes
25053	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	No
27684	And that is one of the reasons why the Afghan security forces have so much work to do to fight this.	No
29634	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	No
27489	Because if it's just us who impose sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place for a long time.	No
12781	Fourthly, I believe that polls and other studies and votes at the United Nations and anyone who reads the newspaper and every citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer bears the same image of a vital society in motion with its brightest days in advance as it was a decade or two decades ago.	No
2703	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	No
19501	You add all the states that used instant control and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	No
15298	But he will take some studies and some work, and not just pass a tax increase to let the charge - or roof - fall on the next administration.	No
30112	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	No
6966	We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	No
32298	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	No
15706	It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.	No
4402	I'm ready to go right now.	No
10188	And so we're matching them up.	No
1298	There have been more than 13 hundred indictments in the HUD, more than eight hundred convictions for real estate loans.	Yes
31890	I apologize to the American people.	No
13126	I believe that we must live up to our commitment to Formosa.	No
21339	The trick is to expand our export base and expand trade on fair terms for us.	No
3084	And by using this base of strength, and using idealism, honesty, predictability, commitment, integrity of our own country, that is where our strength lies.	No
32607	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	No
32347	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	Yes
14952	We've had central accounting.	Yes
587	I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	No
20320	As a result, seniors will not only have a health insurance plan where poor seniors will have paid prescription drugs, but there will be a variety of options.	No
12920	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	No
24260	I will protect the worker by continuing to veto him, and threaten to do so until we have this new Congress, and then we will move forward in our plan.	No
16846	The estimate from the outside, if you have eliminated all tax shelters, is $5 billion.	Yes
33930	...and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	Yes
27797	But I've made a different bet on American workers.	No
13852	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	No
7022	Eleven other presidents -- six democrats and five republicans -- have experienced wars, recessions, great difficulties; none of them have lost jobs as the president has done.	Yes
19245	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	No
28160	We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.	Yes
23098	He wanted to give people rights.	No
23250	Do you know what he presented us with?	No
17365	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	No
15175	Yes, I would very much like to answer.	No
25944	And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.	Yes
27740	First of all, it is not the government that brings business to a successful conclusion.	No
21901	If people say, well, he was elected to do that and then Congress says, okay, I'll do it.	No
32679	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, that you did very powerful with the stupidest deal I've ever seen in the history of the negotiation, the Iranian deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill this room.	Yes
14900	So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	No
9051	And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	No
14738	And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?	No
30064	We will take out ISIS.	No
20283	I said eight years ago, they were campaigning on prescription drugs for seniors.	No
18652	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	Yes
22102	New world order to me means freedom and democracy.	No
14277	We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.	Yes
26766	So we want to end discrimination.	No
32764	I think the use of special forces, which we use, the use of facilitators and trainers in Iraq, which has had positive effects, are in our interest, and so I support what is happening, but let me just...	Yes
7030	This is exactly where the tax cuts took place.	Yes
16398	There is much to be done.	No
14954	We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	No
14759	Well, guys, we have one, and this one's a financial crisis.	Yes
7658	I have talked to Negro mothers.	No
32839	Well, 67 percent of people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humiliated by that.	Yes
8032	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	No
29040	Lower crime rate for eight years in a row.	Yes
16664	I understand that Governor Carter has indicated that he approves a $30 billion federal government expenditure on education.	Yes
29743	They would have won a call.	No
1816	I'm used to saying something that's not always true, but keep repeating it and hope I will believe it.	No
619	Wouldn't it be nice to be the ice cream man that you never make a mistake?	No
12359	I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	No
32040	... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	Yes
28392	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	Yes
19945	It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
19805	But where I moved to work with the Americans to help them get the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	No
11439	So I don't think they should look at us any other than what we are.	No
1423	Now it's less than the growth of 9 points-two percent in the first quarter, and that's less than the growth of 5 percent in the second quarter.	Yes
4033	And we honor all the service that they've provided.	No
15008	And I think something can be done from there, because an objective for all of us should be that one day things will not be done because of or despite the differences between us - ethnic or racial, whatever they may be - that we will have equal opportunities for all.	No
18258	You've got to help us over there.	No
81	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	Yes
25847	You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	Yes
3893	And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	Yes
6586	I show how I pay for health care, how we pay for education.	No
30068	She's been doing it a long time.	No
17805	That's why I want four more years.	No
27115	I don't expect it in the future.	No
33309	Hillary wants to grant the amnesty.	Yes
8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	No
20466	The administration did not deal with it.	Yes
30081	He actually pleaded for the actions we took in Libya and asked for Gaddafi to be out, after doing some business with him once.	Yes
25923	There's been a lot of things that might not have happened.	No
7921	It's gonna be a test of our strength.	No
33872	We have a great general, four stars general, today you read it in every newspaper, will potentially serve five years in prison for lying to the FBI.	Yes
16710	When Mr. Nixon made his famous speech on Operation Independence, we imported about 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
33810	And now I'm listening to how she's gonna get rid of ISIS.	No
33544	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
21003	I think the economy meant more to the people of Gore and Clinton than the people of Gore and Clinton meant to the economy.	No
32440	But I have no loans with Russia.	Yes
30118	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	Yes
26249	I wish I had one in this race, but I don't have one.	No
2756	You'll have a hospital and providers that won't accept any more medical insurance patients.	No
22984	It's also a curious thing for him to say since after 1993, he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	Yes
14022	Our country has sold to foreign lobbyists.	Yes
33170	But I think it is absolutely important that we support it, because it is under such trauma.	No
17988	Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.	Yes
6638	U.S. salaries have fallen.	Yes
25956	And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	Yes
9058	But we have gone through all these things and have even reached new heights and grandeur.	No
18417	And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	Yes
26119	We have the property at 15 years old.	Yes
14646	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	Yes
13031	In other words, the next president, who runs America and the free world, cannot be as great as the American people.	No
5862	We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, which is now about to perpetrate one of the biggest frauds in the country's electoral history, perhaps destroying the fabric of democracy.	Yes
28924	Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.	Yes
31922	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	No
11152	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	No
15713	And we protect some options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	No
13925	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
21824	They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	Yes
8212	But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	No
2315	It wasn't just Wall Street.	No
18012	We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	No
14916	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	Yes
19944	I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	No
8448	Secondly, it was said that the democratic platform would cost a lot of money and that I am in favour of budgetary balance.	No
13012	There are only three left.	Yes
14057	If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	No
1778	So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.	No
13105	Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	No
26398	She finally gave it up.	No
32511	And the money is with people who took advantage of every break in the tax code.	No
16624	By providing our employees with better mental health care, we have increased the number of employees.	Yes
13349	He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	No
8951	I put my veto to 993 measures without the veto being overturned.	Yes
24127	The one with which we came to create jobs for the American people.	Yes
19983	It is the government, as I have already said, which has taken its money for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	No
13750	I want the line-item veto.	No
1516	Right now, we're at peace.	No
5854	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize ourselves as bad people.	No
14032	And it goes on and on and on.	No
11751	I mentioned the debt of the Third World.	No
15490	We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	No
18699	I fought for proliferation all the time -- anti-proliferation all the time I was in Congress.	Yes
18712	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	No
9865	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	No
20459	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	No
20878	I want the federal government, in accordance with local control and new accountability, to make improving our schools the number one priority for Caley to have an office and sit in a classroom where she can learn.	No
12124	So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	No
7682	These are the issues to which the President must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	No
5664	But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.	No
19767	It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	No
15963	We'll lose it when it's taken out of our pay before we even get it.	No
6478	Yes, we can be safe, if we remain on the offence against terrorists and if we spread freedom and freedom around the world.	No
201	Well, no, it's not an answer to those 37 million people, most of whom are members of working families who don't have a penny of health insurance and don't know how to pay bills if their children get sick at night.	Yes
98	And we want to bring him to justice.	No
30421	I was gonna say something...	No
12328	What are we gonna tell our kids?	No
3188	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	Yes
14767	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and savings account to manage?	No
20272	He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.	Yes
24808	I would never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I do it for you.	No
22199	So that's what our program is talking about.	No
26502	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and it would have been the end.	No
1930	I think it's not just an economic problem, I think it's a moral problem.	No
13136	We tried to persuade Chiang Kai-shek at the end of January 1959 to reduce the number of troops he had on them.	Yes
14315	So we're making spectacular progress.	No
1060	I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	No
261	He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	Yes
23822	It's a movement that comes from the people.	No
533	But we need a presidential leadership.	No
94	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no indication that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no solid evidence before we charged him.	Yes
22920	We're going to build alliances.	No
10804	He wants to give the average CEO of Fortune 500 an additional $700,000 in tax reductions.	Yes
32271	Look at this horrible -- they're radical Islamic terrorists.	Yes
27840	Let -- let -- let's...	No
18571	But you must also show that you are ready to bring the rest of the world into and share the stakes.	No
20390	He said all poor seniors.	No
23525	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	No
10353	We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	No
25169	We want to know when we will respond that we fight with those responsible for terrorist acts.	No
20897	We encourage parents to examine the comparative results of schools.	No
24542	Third, we should have training camps for non-violent offenders so that they can obtain discipline, treatment and education and reconnect with the community before they are separated and sent to prison, where they can learn to be first-class criminals.	No
13838	By the time I couldn't get them to solve these problems, I had created so much stress at the board of directors, who just wanted to keep Lawrence Welk's music running, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	No
13831	I did everything I could to get General Motors to deal with his problems in the mid-1980s when he was still financially strong.	Yes
22558	I don't like the way John Ashcroft applied it, and we're gonna change a few things.	No
17867	Yes, we have an increase in the defence budget.	Yes
26943	This is not the right path for us.	No
23869	And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	No
19699	I do not understand the extension of the no-fly zone in the south when the problem was in the north.	No
22594	I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	No
8702	their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	Yes
13165	This is not the number of people working in an administration.	No
12189	Because through his own budget figures, his spending proposals for tax cuts for the richest of the rich are more than his new spending proposals for health care and education and national defence all combined.	Yes
5663	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	Yes
18453	I think Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy and the others did it more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow their tracks.	No
14891	The recession that took place at that time was the shortest since the Second World War.	Yes
33415	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	Yes
20359	I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	No
7946	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	No
738	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	No
20058	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	No
15745	But there are limits to what we can spend.	No
23161	Yes, I think we should look at the sanction and we should have some limitations.	No
4360	That is the central issue of our time.	No
13884	But one mistake he made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles per gallon will throw a lot of auto workers out of work, and you can't have both ways.	Yes
27705	And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	Yes
2657	And by the way, I've had that experience.	No
19991	I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.	No
14736	Horace Greeley said the only thing that lasts is character.	No
287	I just don't want to see the notes on the movies.	No
20703	We have too many polls and focus groups in Washington today.	No
5839	And I'm not going to defend someone saying that because someone shouted something at a rally -- there are a lot of things that were shouted at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy either.	No
27993	They held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom, hope and opportunity.	No
7602	Where I criticized the administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr Nixon, was because at his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the Bicta-Bict-Batista dictatorship - this dictatorship had killed more than 20,000 Cubans in seven years.	Yes
20031	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	No
7758	So let me sum up by saying: I am not satisfied with what we are doing in the cold war because I believe that we must intensify our activities and launch an offensive for the minds, hearts and souls of men.	No
23894	So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	No
17668	I remember clearly that I was working on another subject.	No
19826	And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	No
12759	Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	No
7773	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the United States, militarily, politically, psychologically and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the United States in relation to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated over the last eight years and we should know that, and the American people should be informed of the facts.	Yes
17242	And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	Yes
14988	"Broken windows, painted on one of them ""Promesses not held;"" on the other, ""Despair."""	No
29434	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	No
33739	Does this create jobs, increase incomes, and contribute to our national security?	No
28517	Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	No
11952	I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	No
57	I'm doing better in the neighborhoods.	No
26805	We should have more debates.	No
9022	But I do not think that the State, the Council of Regents, an Education Council, or any State official should try to compose this prayer for a child to recite.	No
29373	And by the way, my tax reduction is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
24637	And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.	No
17900	Can we say, really, that we will be better when we come out of some sort of American basic instinct of decency and fairness?	No
26309	He won't tell you because he can't.	No
28716	You know, some parents worry about these filters, that you'll have to ask your kids how to put them there.	No
13623	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	No
22307	I just want to mention if I could --	No
14396	We have never let Congress and external relations, the Senate's intelligence committees see them.	Yes
13278	He did not take this position on Tibet.	Yes
6032	And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	No
8744	We simply can't have people sitting at the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams that come in and out of our big cities.	No
11083	This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	No
8784	But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	Yes
27127	They didn't form a unit group, a council of some kind.	No
17651	We have more people who receive food stamps than ever before -- 230,000 more receive them -- even though we removed 850,000 of our food stamps because they earned more income than any that justified their fellow citizens having to support them.	Yes
25401	If we could stop now the testing and deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go far beyond research; if it were only research, we would have no argument, because perhaps one day someone will think of something -- but committing this nation to an accumulation of anti-satellite and space weapons at present, in their raw state, would lead to an arms race that is indeed very dangerous.	No
16526	Well, the assumption that - which you have described as different - is in the growth rate of our economy.	No
33648	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	No
26335	Family medical leave has allowed 12 million families to take some time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their jobs.	Yes
25390	Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	No
26082	I met that woman again.	No
19107	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	No
14705	I would like to say to Mr Bush, although I have profound differences with him, I honour his service to our country.	No
13767	I've been speaking out since day 1.	No
28131	And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.	No
4032	No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	No
21463	But character is an important part of the equation.	No
14914	The new economic revitalization program we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits that would allow businesses to invest in new tools and plants to create even more jobs - about a million over the next two years.	No
23048	I wanted to get something done.	No
32600	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	No
32040	...because everything he just said is absolutely wrong, but I'm not surprised.	Yes
15095	And I said, well, yeah.	No
30124	And I think that's great.	No
22314	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than all other countries.	Yes
8610	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	No
29230	We have to stop them from leaving.	No
33593	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people living in poverty should not - who are working full-time should not yet be in poverty.	No
14044	And I don't think there's a problem with an honest person who finds himself representing an interest in another country to do his cause.	No
19626	We were not firm and strong.	No
4323	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing better work along our borders, too.	No
56	We consume 50% of the world's cocaine.	Yes
19046	We'll fight terrorists all over the world so we don't have to face them here at home.	No
1298	There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	Yes
12335	A deep scientist recently made another...	No
29465	So you didn't read it.	No
20753	Imagine how many IRS agents it will take to be able to determine its targeted tax reduction for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	Yes
11666	But we can't be all things for everyone in the world, Jim.	No
13807	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	No
8497	And if this House and this Senate, at the next session, are Democrats or Republicans, if the country voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals it has made, I think you will find that the President, if he were Republican, as was the case in my case, could get his program through this Congress.	No
33030	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	Yes
13409	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	No
14473	Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	Yes
27954	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	Yes
31889	I apologize to my family.	No
28161	This represents up to 44 million people.	Yes
20072	And to move this country forward and we're better than we were four years ago.	No
11135	... just a quick follow-up on this.	No
8337	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	No
23424	And we're going to put our labs, colleges and universities to work.	No
18963	I have found that, in this world, it is important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you disagree, you can disagree effectively.	No
27220	We must defend our principles, defend our allies, defend a strong army and defend a stronger economy.	No
25856	Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	No
24681	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	No
20868	I'm here with a group of 13 people from across the country who helped me prepare.	No
23720	And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.	No
1572	I served a hospital administration.	No
23963	So that is where my income limit would trigger.	No
11489	Secondly, I think it is important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, such as Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	No
4384	So we put all the chips in, right there, and no one's talking about losing this war.	No
2951	If we turn to Helsinki, I'm glad you raised it, Mr. Frankel.	No
14672	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	No
3713	We need to understand very poorly that defence spending is very important and vital, especially in the new challenges we face in the world, but we need to deal with a lot of cost overruns.	No
8327	Now that we have these surpluses, it is our responsibility to compensate the farmer during this period that we dispose of the farmer, the surpluses.	No
20848	Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	No
22765	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he was principled.	No
23166	I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	No
9661	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	No
21557	What you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you have two other choices, don't you?	No
12820	But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	No
1982	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	No
30009	And I'm very proud of it.	No
14533	Reducing White House staff by a third after or at the same time Congress does the same for its staff.	No
17583	From 50,000 to 50,000, these people paid two thirds of the taxes, and these people got two thirds of the tax reduction.	Yes
23992	Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	Yes
16707	The proposed reorganization that I have presented is a first step.	Yes
27665	No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	Yes
19208	The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	Yes
14755	You bet we can govern because we will be there together and we will find what to do, and you will not tolerate interference, you will not tolerate endless wandering and wandering, and you will not tolerate non-performance.	No
10721	We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	No
32910	600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	No
3726	That is a multi-year project.	Yes
18077	I decided to go there myself.	No
14729	We're living in an interconnected world.	No
29790	And I firmly believe that common sense firearms security measures would help us.	No
15165	unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	No
26077	Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.	No
3831	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	No
3158	We now have five nations with atomic bombs that we know.	Yes
23087	We have not only repaired the health insurance and taken it away in the future, we have done something you can't do: we have balanced the budget.	Yes
32514	I want to have a tax on people who make a million dollars.	No
34447	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	Yes
1049	I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	Yes
12041	There has been a recent investigation into the number of people in Texas who have obtained -- who have received permits for concealed weapons despite the fact that they have files.	Yes
12961	And then, all over the world, name the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - not only - not just people who have made a political contribution but can speak the language.	No
10145	But let me mention another thing.	No
32831	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	No
33333	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	No
12516	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	No
28172	And you must know the record here.	No
17379	But I'm aware of what we asked for.	No
16442	First, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide a large number of jobs.	No
8367	The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	No
19658	And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	Yes
22113	It was the United States that took the lead in humanitarian aid in Bosnia.	Yes
429	You know, the vice-president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal permission program that is one of the most permissive in the country, which last year gave 7,000 permissions to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people he says he wants to execute now.	Yes
22424	I think we need to educate and recycle better.	No
27292	Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...	No
2217	They'll have at least two plans.	Yes
3697	Also, by ensuring that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to the population centres that use them.	No
19919	And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	No
6040	Senator Obama does not want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region, but wants to sit on the table without preconditions for -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who helped the FARC, the terrorist organization.	Yes
344	I do not see this, moreover, as a democrat or a republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	No
9088	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	No
10816	Social security is not so hard.	No
11705	And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	No
27831	I said we would provide guarantees, and that's what allowed these companies to go bankrupt, get out of bankruptcy.	Yes
25489	But to put an end to this madness of arms, we must move forward with difficult negotiations that are verifiable so that we know that the Soviets agree and that they live up to their agreement.	No
32475	And she never will change.	No
9389	I'm all for oil production.	No
26918	I congratulate him for leaving Osama bin Laden and for pursuing the leaders of Al-Qaeda.	No
13186	So first it'll be Quemoy and Matsu, then maybe it'll be Formosa.	No
508	Let me just give you one other example.	No
23780	And that requires a firm, strong and determined president.	No
13973	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	No
15218	I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	No
6170	And I firmly believe that we should have candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	No
17531	The issue of agriculture came up a minute ago.	No
20551	And I believe, for example, that there is a right to privacy in the fourth amendment.	No
20573	He's going to put some liberal-judge activists who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, and that's what he's going to do.	No
10632	That's really part of your mistrust here.	No
34143	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	No
14144	In New Hampshire, Senator Kerrey said you should tell the truth about it.	No
162	So it's not that we take too little - from the taxpayer - we still spend too much.	No
26018	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	No
31921	We're gonna do America again, but we're gonna make America safe.	No
8116	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of force we build in the United States will be the defence of freedom.	No
19011	It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	No
28921	I think it should be administered not only with fair attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all crucial cases, but also with very careful attention.	No
17026	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	No
25153	Then the embassy exploded a few weeks ago, and once again none of the measures that should have been taken were taken.	Yes
2232	And private insurers have to make a profit.	No
9822	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	Yes
12529	Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	No
22089	Number three on pension funds, I don't know that much, but I'm gonna say it.	No
15940	So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	No
13392	Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	No
21842	People don't dare -- doctors, to help someone along the highway who's injured because they're afraid some lawyers will come with them and get a big trial.	No
8261	And it is a fact that in most of the last 25 years, the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the elderly, the development of the Tennessee Valley, the development of our natural resources.	Yes
545	We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.	Yes
33554	We are spending a fortune doing it.	No
21094	This is a fundamental difference between what we believe.	No
3078	And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	No
19349	That's why we need campaign finance reform.	No
24140	Look at the index of misery when the Democrats had both the White House and Congress.	No
966	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy, own and live, so that we can put an end to the shame of despair in America.	No
465	As I have seen abortions sometimes used as a contraceptive device, for heaven's sake.	Yes
6522	I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.	No
24008	It's got to be fair.	No
26092	$500 per child under 18.	Yes
16763	Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	No
21725	We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	No
32862	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	No
3532	And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.	Yes
24133	And another is to stimulate investment and savings.	No
20105	I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	Yes
23431	It's good for small businesses, good for owners.	No
18717	But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	No
32905	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	No
3660	Let's give each American one choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and two -- and let the Americans choose if they want the -- existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	No
29799	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just the police.	No
29329	Nothing will ever be at the forefront of NAFTA.	No
23969	Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.	No
15536	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	No
19659	But it will cover pre-existing conditions.	Yes
20162	And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	Yes
28702	I was on my peroration.	No
6372	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	No
19447	We have to do it together and we can.	No
13004	This means keeping America even stronger militarily than it is.	No
34175	We need to continue the leadership.	No
17326	We have never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	No
8156	I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	No
22572	The first president in 72 years to lose his job.	Yes
26529	If we save money and deprive people of care, it's a bad thing.	No
28398	So I want to do something about that.	No
27285	And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	No
29990	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	Yes
12201	And in return, get a fifth of the benefits, because most tax cuts go to people at the bottom of the economic scale.	Yes
13542	In other words, if the United States is to maintain its strength and prestige, we must not only be strong in military and economic terms, but also be diplomatically firm.	No
26174	Of course the president will take credit for that.	No
4380	This is therefore a national security problem.	No
28253	I think that's a mistake.	No
18697	Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	No
12530	I think there are several reasons.	No
12025	One I don't think it will be an effective tool to do -- keep our society safe.	No
13270	Flight U-2 in May just before the conference was a mistake in the moment because of the dangers involved, if the summit conference had a hope of success.	No
29109	We must also make the economy more equitable.	No
17482	The underprivileged will go out in the back alley as they did before.	No
8013	Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.	Yes
19881	And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.	No
23822	This is a movement that came from the people.	No
26222	I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	No
24046	They don't want us to control him, very frankly.	No
16545	Now, it seems to me that as we look at the recommendations of the Budget Committees and our own projections, there will be no $60 billion dividend.	Yes
24134	I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	No
16199	George, we have procurement management today under the 1985 bill.	No
12367	I can feel the same place.	No
10443	And now we need to take decisive action.	No
1333	And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	No
20530	I said I'd make sure the women are safe who use drugs.	Yes
20685	My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	No
16520	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	No
34135	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	No
15702	If I knew three new weapons systems that I thought were garbage and that were not protected by Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	No
19499	Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	No
4343	It is important that we understand that the way we are perceived in the world will make a difference in our ability to achieve cooperation and eliminate terrorism.	No
2111	I'm not sure where that comes from, except for this, that is, I'd like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to the states and tell a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor as you think best.	No
22860	I fully understand the threat.	No
8151	Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.	Yes
26230	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	No
33825	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	Yes
24509	And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	No
22779	And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	No
32585	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
1361	You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.	No
14637	Why I'm gonna win is that I think I have the best plan of all three of us here to do something about it.	No
15968	The fact is that you must have a president who is ready to do it and start right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state who had a very, very successful experience to do this.	No
1040	But I think that a balanced approach, with everyone being part of it and an effort of unselfishness, could help as in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	No
8295	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	No
9184	And take the money we spent on the war over the last decade to rebuild America, the roads, the school bridges.	No
4359	And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	No
6205	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	No
8242	I believe that the programs that Senator Kennedy is advocating will tend to stifle these creative energies, that is, their program would lead to the stagnation of the motivating power that we need in the country to achieve progress.	No
23933	Decide who you think will do the job.	No
10660	My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	No
23679	He shouldn't have made that decision.	No
27230	Do everything we can to control our own energy.	No
8611	The means are in question.	No
16665	At present, we are spending about three billion five hundred million dollars.	Yes
20851	I'm interested in kids.	No
17097	In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	Yes
24225	And so I'm going to ask for support for this to be implemented.	No
25270	This is the kind of leadership we have had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our time.	No
4247	And what we had to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it ended.	No
16869	But in this process, we saved $9 billion.	Yes
25448	But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.	No
13366	Fourthly, I suggested that medical care for the elderly - and the bill that Congress passed and that the Speaker signed if fully implemented would cost the Treasury $1 billion - from the Treasury and $1 billion by the states - the proposal that I put forward and that many members of my party support for social security-funded medical care; that would be funded by social security taxes; that is less than three hundred per person per day for medical care, physician bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	Yes
8070	The people have to make up their minds.	No
23543	I did to because I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.	No
90	I'm very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	No
19407	Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	No
7042	And then we had a recession and we were attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	Yes
17429	There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	No
23063	We're not talking about third-world drugs.	No
11557	The administration deserves the merit of having it run.	No
23776	Home ownership is still high in America.	Yes
20012	You didn't even have any tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	Yes
32727	Why can't they do it quietly?	No
17697	I know that they are all for science and training education, which I strongly support.	No
7295	I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	Yes
12191	So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	No
25036	I'll keep this nation strong.	No
21774	I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	No
17524	There are a million and a half people waiting to adopt children who cannot have them otherwise.	Yes
18883	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position is consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	No
25181	"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"	No
18025	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	No
8622	This is the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	No
33739	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	No
17152	Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.	No
3805	And we will return home with victory and honor.	No
10792	But I think it is important to understand that we do not solve social security and health insurance unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	No
12220	And they didn't.	Yes
8152	I do not believe in the great government, but I believe in effective government action.	No
22013	It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.	No
24188	Having a third task force on the new industries of the future to ensure that we nail them for our country and that they do not end up in Europe and Asia.	No
23718	"He complains that our troops do not have the right equipment, but he voted against the $87 billion supplement I sent to Congress and then published one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	Yes
542	But here's the point he misses.	No
13358	Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	Yes
12879	This was expressed in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	No
6865	Now we also have sicker people because they don't have health insurance.	No
17582	And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.	Yes
14082	And we should have to limit - we should have a much longer period, about 5 years, between when people can leave executive offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	No
21238	I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	No
17909	These laws are not enforced, they have not been enforced, and public health, air and water pay the price.	No
9878	I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.	No
25271	Now we have a runaway arms race.	No
14736	Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	No
28571	They're aimed at the real problem.	No
27693	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the disc, you look at the disc.	No
28502	And I'm happy to tell you that we have.	No
14519	That, however, is not my only passion.	No
28398	So I want to do something about it.	No
17980	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	No
30145	And you're gonna stop them?	No
32580	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	No
7805	We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	No
1251	We now have, uh - for example, only 7 percent of the total cost of education is funded by the federal government.	Yes
29497	And the only thing that seems good is the stock exchange, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, it'll fall.	Yes
32969	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	No
22263	Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	No
18431	We know that he promised America that he would build this coalition.	Yes
19289	Well, here's the problem: it sounds great, but there's a reason for 500 economists, including seven Nobel laureates and business periodicals like Business Week, and even the friends of Senator Dole, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican Senator of New Hampshire, to say it's not a practical program.	Yes
25515	Well, as I say, we need to look at what a reversal there would mean and what the government that would follow would be.	No
16627	If we do not, bureaucratic disorder will continue.	No
18578	We have to start spending the money now.	No
245	So research, the acceleration of drugs on the market, testing, the blood supply are very important elements of this.	No
13613	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	Yes
25325	We don't think these people should be allowed to continue operating for free.	No
23970	In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	No
7778	The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	Yes
20105	I said that we would change the way social well-being works, and even before the bill was passed, we had moved nearly two million people from social well-being to work, working with states and communities.	Yes
8154	It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.	No
12797	But I think that the effort should be made once again by whom ever elected President of the United States.	No
1155	It is something, however, that I think, which indicates the need for the American people to know how their commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and I think the only criticism I would have - about Mr Ford is that - immediately when the statement was re - revealed, - perhaps - a statement by the president would have been a clarification and a very beneficial thing.	No
8480	It seems to me once again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the fact that the eight Democrats did not get something through this particular committee.	No
8899	It seems to me that denying the federal government's responsibility to do something about our collapsed cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: to 55% of the black population of our country who is locked up in the inner cities of our country's metropolitan areas.	Yes
20230	And this contrasts with my worthy opponent's plan, which will significantly increase the size of the government.	Yes
5537	And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	No
11398	As far as foreign policy is concerned, that will be my guiding question.	No
11090	I've been there my whole life.	No
46	These are the values I want to bring to the Presidency and the White House from January 1989 onwards.	No
15353	Barbara, reluctant to say something critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	No
1809	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax reduction.	No
9175	I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	No
18569	You have to close the borders.	No
7803	We need to step up trade; we need to step up technical assistance so that people trained in these new developing countries can exploit the economy.	No
10267	Governor Romney wants to increase this tax relief.	Yes
23933	Decide who you think will do the job.	No
29740	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	Yes
26540	It is in other states that we also visit.	No
19415	Even though I have always opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and I have worked hard against them.	Yes
1465	Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
10112	#NAME?	No
23755	But I will also have a better plan of how we will deal with Iraq: to train Iraqi forces faster, to bring our allies back to the table with a new start, with a new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	No
22679	And now, Osama bin Laden could be in jail or dead.	No
25553	But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	No
26630	Did you say you were unemployed?	No
13706	Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	Yes
24968	So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.	No
27468	I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	No
12223	But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.	No
6669	This president did not defend Boeing when Airbus violated international rules and subsidies.	Yes
23332	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	Yes
22948	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	No
7991	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp in 1957, said that there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a low-cost basic diet.	Yes
22377	Now, if that's not the case, General Waller would be -- you say, why continue to choose military personnel.	No
19094	Four years ago, you thought I was a believer.	No
23996	I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.	No
24948	What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	No
3790	On the way to the war in Iraq.	No
14127	Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	No
24427	This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	No
1823	There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	Yes
2077	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	Yes
14419	In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	Yes
14648	It doesn't work that way when you're president.	No
8809	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	No
14895	In the second quarter, we reduced it to about 13%.	Yes
24691	Ross, it's a nice speech, but it's not that simple.	No
34107	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	No
7067	And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	No
15267	I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	Yes
26184	You're almost not old enough to remember.	No
19496	You're not going to worry about it anymore.	No
8019	We should come to its defense.	No
70	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
29511	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	Yes
20638	I would be guarded in my approach.	No
24244	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	No
19707	Have we caused any damage?	No
18744	I believe we could have done better.	No
6866	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	Yes
24453	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	No
8578	Not at all because they are determined men.	No
29792	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	Yes
12284	We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	No
21380	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	Yes
675	No one suggests that we disarm unilaterally or that we reduce our forces in one way or another, of course not.	No
27247	We're missing 9 million jobs.	Yes
7267	In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.	No
13741	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to take care of it.	No
34065	This is how Donald thinks.	No
780	You're judged by the entire record.	No
23035	And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	No
19757	I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.	Yes
19895	If a local school district in Cleveland or any other place wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have it.	No
8808	With that, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	No
24101	Your question was on fairness.	No
25916	I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.	No
8195	We have built more schools in the last seven and a half years than we have built in the previous seven and a half years, indeed in the last twenty years.	Yes
23785	We will deny the sanctuary to these terrorists.	No
24499	We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	Yes
11479	But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	No
25870	I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	Yes
5501	Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	No
24602	We have increased funding for AIDS.	Yes
4319	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than 11 September.	No
30442	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	No
27585	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 democratic senators saying that tensions with Israel were a real problem.	Yes
26502	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	No
25480	I will not accept any agreement on arms control, including a freeze, which is not verifiable.	No
24995	And now we are putting in place a defence of our own.	Yes
8438	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	No
6077	We need to have more community health centres.	No
2509	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	No
3628	Let me just make a few remarks.	No
19376	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	No
8018	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	No
27914	And the only thing that I am quite clear about is that after a decade of drifting jobs, jobs shipped abroad, no one defending American workers and American companies, we have now begun to make real progress.	Yes
29666	And that's what I do.	No
20378	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	Yes
13640	It will take a just and shared sacrifice.	No
7077	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	No
28526	But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	No
851	I think we can agree on this during this campaign.	No
25077	I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	No
1763	But not because of his policies.	No
20007	Don't forget, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he has to cut off health insurance to pay for it.	Yes
29201	When they sell in us, there's no tax.	Yes
7703	We have to practice what we preach.	No
21013	And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	No
12683	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one establishing the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of another American country - and they also agreed to do the same.	Yes
18928	It is a central element in the fight against weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	No
24260	I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	No
2588	And what we are seeing right now is, in my opinion, a downward government approach, which has the government that thinks it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	No
21410	Now, the facts are that we have to fix it.	No
33150	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	No
23778	Tonight, I had the opportunity to discuss with you what to do to maintain this economy: keep taxes low, not increase the reach of the federal government, keep regulation low, reform legislation, a health care policy that does not empower the federal government, but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign energy sources.	No
26004	Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	Yes
16854	These programs that I described to you earlier - foreign tax deferrals, DISC, and tax shelters, uh - only apply to people in the $50,000 or more a year, and I think that's the best way to do it.	Yes
10131	And so, what can we do to intervene, to ensure that young people have the opportunity, that our schools work, that if there is violence on the street, that we work with religious groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it is out of control.	No
13007	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	No
8463	Secondly, we have passed a federal bill on assistance in education in the Senate.	Yes
12407	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without real basic aid until the end of the next president's four-year term.	Yes
7692	The right to vote is basic.	No
16090	And he said at that time, in a quote, and it's a paraphrase, a gel, it's easy.	No
21028	Now he's having to say that again.	No
23973	We don't need tax cuts for the rich for nothing.	No
6018	And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	No
8664	Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	Yes
8089	And the Republicans of recent years - not only in the last 25 years, but over the last 8 years - have opposed housing, the care of the elderly, federal support for education, the minimum wage, and I think this record says a lot.	Yes
21378	Here's some thing that'll help.	No
33143	Thank you very much, Chris.	No
8083	This is progress, a concern for the well-being of the population.	No
8977	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	No
1678	I am pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, as well as the Presidential Commission on these debates.	No
24551	The first thing I would do is, during the political campaigns, I would urge everyone to stop trying to divide this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the crucible is all broken after November 3.	No
24685	Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	No
11028	I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	No
1827	That is, I want to bring down rates.	No
8327	Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	No
3245	He speaks of peace and I am grateful for peace.	No
16061	I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	No
15604	I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	No
22205	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	Yes
19695	We've learned that you give him an inch that he'll take a mile.	No
3432	We must therefore act quickly, and we must act wisely.	No
10853	But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	No
25442	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	No
2452	And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.	No
8125	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
25597	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	No
15369	Today, by its own decision, the poverty index is more than 20%, and I think that should suggest something.	Yes
448	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	No
20746	Those are very clear differences.	No
8151	Seventeen million Americans, who live more than sixty-five on an average social security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, are not able to maintain themselves individually, but they can maintain themselves through the social security system.	Yes
21384	I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	Yes
17503	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	No
26352	But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	Yes
1029	If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	No
12672	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	No
19863	I think we should lift them up and move our children forward.	No
10769	Small businesses across America will have to reduce their jobs and taxes will increase and will not be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	No
25693	Would I understand if that happened to me, and I could just say I'm a big family.	No
2900	And I will not exclude the American people from this process in the future, as Mr Ford and Mr Kissinger did.	Yes
20064	I have family for Medicare.	No
15557	More Americans at work today than at any time in the country's history, and a higher percentage of the workforce.	Yes
16282	Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	No
11990	In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	Yes
21414	People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	Yes
7242	He said that in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	No
7522	"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	No
2945	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	Yes
24223	The plans are all over Washington.	No
16564	So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	No
30127	But I'm all for NATO.	No
12737	If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.	No
14480	People deserve this since we have to take the tab; you have the CIP money, we will pay the tab.	No
12525	In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	Yes
36	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	No
21456	I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	No
29110	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	No
245	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	No
7136	We're not allowed to vote on it.	Yes
11947	I agree with that, and I did support that law.	No
23742	Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	No
244	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	No
12924	Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.	No
14625	And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	Yes
7980	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	No
7914	I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.	No
3487	We have not put in place a regulatory framework for the twenty-first century to address these issues.	No
18801	We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	Yes
8863	We have thousands and thousands of houses held by the government, vandalized, that have been seized in mortgage seizures.	Yes
25461	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	No
20737	I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.	No
24519	You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	No
8083	It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	No
20871	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	No
10057	Look at what's happening in Syria, Egypt, now in Libya.	No
12801	I think the Committee on Atomic Energy is ready to do so.	No
25757	I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	No
16623	For example, in the Department of Transportation, we have reduced the total number of employees by about 25 per cent.	Yes
6574	President Bush took -- he is the only president of history to do so.	Yes
26416	Let's see the facts.	No
34116	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	Yes
26954	But what has happened in the last two years is that, as we have seen this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos is happening, you see Al-Qaida rushing, you see other jihadist groups rushing.	Yes
26589	And people have to decide.	No
3715	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	Yes
27214	So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	No
18562	And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.	No
639	I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.	No
27804	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	No
6085	Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.	No
19783	That's why I want to continue the work we've done on partisan opposition, working with communities to lower this crime rate until our streets are safe again.	No
11802	Far from suggesting otherwise.	No
15046	The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.	No
7640	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	No
25381	Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	No
23695	Now, you asked what mistakes.	No
28861	If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	No
33274	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	Yes
6562	Those who can afford it will buy themselves.	No
22740	That was the right place.	No
22553	Mr. President, it's good to be back with you tonight, sir.	No
28135	We want them to continue that.	No
34194	If they did it by surprise...	No
20066	I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.	No
1487	But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	No
19296	I want to increase spending by 14 percent, it's how simple it is.	No
15405	And I repeat: I am for women's rights.	No
23724	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	No
5558	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I basically told him was, ""five years ago, when you were able to buy your business, you needed a tax reduction at the time."""	No
27708	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	Yes
28221	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	No
32690	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad kills ISIS.	Yes
546	We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	No
16334	His principal education advisor is in prison He's in prison because he betrayed the trust of the public.	Yes
13841	I went there because it was obvious that we had a total disagreement about what should be done with the company.	No
28521	I want to make sure that the equipment for our army is the best possible, of course.	No
14932	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	No
293	And I don't agree with them.	No
9562	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	Yes
32442	Now, taxes are a very simple thing.	No
1247	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	No
22852	And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	No
14297	You can look everywhere and you'll see strong first-class women.	No
25598	I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	No
3668	That's not true.	No
13376	But social security is a tax.	No
15688	And that's the kind of America I want.	No
23037	There are other ways to ensure that drugs are cheaper.	No
29250	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	Yes
24952	Some of them have been excised, but the party dealing with political terrorism has continued.	No
29246	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	Yes
24793	We've got to change the system.	No
23032	I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	No
1423	Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	Yes
8466	And it is a fact at the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans and who joined two Democrats voted against sending the bill on aid to education to Parliament.	Yes
17758	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	No
19949	It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.	Yes
25350	But with regard to these high interest rates too, at least give us the recognition that when you left the office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the preferential rate.	Yes
7194	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	No
24456	Mr Bush vetoed it twice because he said that we cannot do something that seventy-two other countries are doing, even if there was an exemption for small businesses.	Yes
32905	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3:00 in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	No
12658	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we have seen a decline in our economic growth rather than a gain.	Yes
2655	I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	No
586	But now we have a chance.	No
29734	We need to be -- we need to know what we're doing.	No
25588	A president must know the essential facts to be ordered.	No
14516	I called for a 25% reduction in Congressional staff and expenses.	Yes
30160	The record does not show that.	Yes
34330	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	No
7704	We set a very high standard for ourselves.	No
25118	Our position was at the airport.	No
8699	Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	No
32810	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	No
28772	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	No
9600	And that is one of the reasons why one of the first bills I signed was Bill Lily Ledbetter.	No
24560	We've turned it into a weakness.	No
81	And in my state, I am proud to say that we have organized an education and drug prevention program that the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration considers to be a model for the country.	Yes
18008	And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	No
21029	They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	No
33343	I don't want to rip families apart.	No
27233	This is the kind of leadership we need to show.	No
15831	No, let me tell you something about that.	No
29677	Trump International is ahead of budget and schedule.	Yes
17098	So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	Yes
16572	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	No
7883	First of all, I think Senator Kennedy should decide my responsibility.	No
12514	There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.	No
22187	It is said to give parents the choice of a public, private or public school - public, private or religious.	No
3829	And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	No
19971	And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	No
12601	Africa is today the emerging area of the world.	No
30417	You know, Hillary hits me with huge ads.	No
26599	Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	No
7704	We have set a very high level for ourselves.	No
17494	It's been a good instinct.	No
15753	And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.	No
19151	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	No
12116	He gives power to people, he trusts people, he does -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to buy health insurance.	No
12772	Now, I didn't make most of the statements you said I had made.	No
18392	We have allocated $7 billion over the coming months for reconstruction efforts.	Yes
32512	And, yes, when I was a senator, I voted to fill the company's gaps.	Yes
20983	And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	No
14842	The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.	Yes
33833	And it was all on tape, started with her.	Yes
13175	And this amendment has made the United States Senate aware with a majority of its own party voting in its favour, as well as the majority of the Republicans - note them - against the very position that the senator now takes to renounce, indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	Yes
32161	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	Yes
3818	We didn't catch Bin Laden.	Yes
13717	I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	No
13703	So we have to do this.	No
23308	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who will keep the economy growing so that people can work?	No
24747	But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.	Yes
1536	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	No
21700	We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	No
1189	I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	No
722	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States, have never been so ready.	No
11402	Strong relations in Europe are in the interest of our nation.	No
30062	First of all, I have to say one thing, very important.	No
31932	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	Yes
27679	And it's important for them.	No
22198	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	No
17349	The Americans want arms control.	No
16194	I believe in the President's Committee on the Outdoors.	No
11993	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	No
15081	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the war in Iran and Iraq.	No
25857	But I think whoever wears a uniform is a great American.	No
3690	We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	No
22721	We're going to train troops, and we are.	No
14010	Or do you just keep lunging in at will?	No
14367	Natl's Women's Political Caucus awarded me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my participation by women at high levels of government, and I have appointed more minorities to high-level positions in government than all the governors of my state's history gathered before me.	Yes
6044	We're not going to follow this path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	No
1969	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	No
21457	In terms of programs, I submitted, what, four different budgets to the American Congress in detail.	Yes
14719	I know we can do better.	No
25820	This is about where we are now.	No
15873	I guess the only thing I'm worried about, Ann, is this attempt to label the things we all believe in.	No
8915	We didn't get the promised government savings; we didn't get the 4% inflation we were supposed to get at the end of Carter's first term.	Yes
8309	I think that this farm policy has failed.	No
9438	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is that middle-income taxpayers have been buried in the last four years.	Yes
17304	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	No
32165	So I want to save a lot of what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	No
3574	Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	No
24190	See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.	No
25380	We'll even give it to you.	No
14533	Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	No
24499	We use the army more now in terms of prohibition.	Yes
7918	If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	No
8260	He was nominated by it.	No
12598	It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	No
21601	But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.	No
2222	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	No
18531	I think my plan is better.	No
16740	And some large manufacturing companies, such as Dow Chemical, have, through a very efficient efficiency mechanism, reduced the use of energy by 40 percent with the same product.	Yes
15321	I'd like to change that.	No
22138	I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	No
15328	Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	No
29149	All you have to do is take a look at the Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	No
7729	And in the area of executive direction, I can say that I believe it is essential that the President of the United States not only set the tone, but also lead; he must act as he speaks.	No
8383	#NAME?	No
8497	And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	No
23870	Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	No
26196	My whole administration is about your future.	No
6493	But we can absolutely be safe in the long term.	No
13952	When you're president of the United States, you can't have that model to say well, I'm in favour, but I'm on the other side.	No
7254	They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	No
21178	We must say that we must all be responsible for what we do.	No
19205	We have the largest decline in the number of people living in poverty in 27 years.	Yes
2218	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	No
27517	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	No
32343	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly in our country?	No
2740	But they lead in very different directions.	No
10463	Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	No
6277	They have to turn off the TV, keep the video games away, and finally start instilling the thirst for knowledge that our students need.	No
7757	Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	No
794	I told you what he said about that.	No
16869	But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.	Yes
32009	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	Yes
13293	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	No
5809	And of course, we are talking about a positive action plan to restore this economy and to restore jobs in America.	No
8601	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	No
17565	Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	No
10736	This includes telling oil companies, which currently have 68 million acres, that they don't use them, that you use them, or that you lose them.	Yes
25195	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	Yes
27796	That's how our free market works.	No
300	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	No
1788	Now, Governor Romney's proposal to promote him for 18 months requires a $5 trillion tax reduction, in addition to an additional $2 trillion for our military.	Yes
32559	She talks about health care.	No
4245	So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	No
1959	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	No
3526	We didn't pay attention to them.	No
20115	Well, he's done it again, that line was used before, I mean, exaggerate all the things he did.	No
33909	I think it's proven.	No
32645	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	No
17037	The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	No
28626	I'm for research and development.	No
10926	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	No
9226	This is what crushes middle-class families.	Yes
3361	Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?	No
14845	But what we have done is to use this enormous power, prestige and military force of the United States to preserve peace.	No
19387	So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	Yes
15191	This would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has had since the Second World War, with al-Presidents, Democrats and Republicans.	No
7393	And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	No
26656	And as we have done, in the areas where we have concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have increased by 85 per cent over the past four years and our trade deficit with Japan has decreased.	Yes
24802	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	No
18238	And I hope it's as soon as possible.	No
31955	I heard them when they came to the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring jobs back to New York and she failed.	Yes
4343	It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.	No
6760	You cannot discriminate in the rights you offer to people.	No
28295	Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.	No
29104	First, we need to build an economy that works for everyone, not just for those at the top.	No
24152	And it is very important that we do not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	No
12016	But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	No
32011	He never apologized to the journalist whom he imitated and mocked on national television and which our children were watching.	Yes
26701	Undoubtedly, our founding fathers had a lot of wisdom.	No
17507	And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
24503	And I'm going to tell you a place that works well, and it's the private sector -- Jim Burke and that working group he has, you may know.	No
20954	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	No
4125	And you know what happened?	No
26127	You know, give yourself a little tax reduction, give you a few years, then make the tax increases continue forever.	No
6661	Today, if you are an American company, you actually get an advantage to go abroad.	No
13663	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	No
11994	I think we should strengthen the enforcement of firearms laws so that those already in the books can be implemented much more effectively.	No
29657	These are words, sound bites.	No
2425	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	Yes
20583	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call Serbia plus Montenegro, and exert pressure in every possible way to recognize the legitimate outcome of the election.	No
19380	That was certainly the case as soon as I got there.	No
22148	And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	No
15211	We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	Yes
17033	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	No
13646	You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	No
6264	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	No
18184	I believe in protecting America first.	No
13508	I think there are a lot of prestige tests, Mr Drummond.	No
2445	And there are ways of doing it.	No
20063	I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.	Yes
12633	On the issue of the admission of red China, only two countries from all over Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	Yes
7754	I would like to point out that over the past six years, democratic congresses, of which he was a member, have cut $20 million from Voice of America programs.	Yes
21363	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	Yes
3730	We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.	Yes
15971	Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	No
15723	Andrea, we just got another example of why the vice president's mathematics doesn't match.	No
4400	Reform, prosperity and peace are major challenges for the United States of America.	No
21976	What I want you to understand is that national debt is not the only cause of this.	No
27010	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	No
13481	Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	No
31871	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	Yes
26231	For me, positive action makes this extra effort.	No
3379	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two things that cannot be debated - experience and results.	No
20637	I would take the use of force very seriously.	No
22781	Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	Yes
18798	I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.	No
1460	Those who say the inflation rate is in good shape should now talk to housewives.	No
19863	I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.	No
25249	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	No
17507	And if it's rape, how do you get moral judgments?	No
12368	It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.	No
13166	It's a question of who they are.	No
7283	And that's why at the beginning of my administration, I called the Attorney General and the lawyers in the United States and said: Set up a working group across the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with weapons.	Yes
30231	He has repeatedly said that he does not care that other nations have nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
32182	In the 17th, she implodes for herself.	Yes
26568	"People say, ""I don't care."	No
30203	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	No
8506	It was not a bill that met my opinion if necessary.	No
8213	A record is never something to hold.	No
28265	But here's what I said.	No
25848	It shouldn't happen in America.	No
12590	I'm looking at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	No
21025	One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.	Yes
2999	Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	Yes
28880	It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.	No
25598	I want a nation of equity, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discrimination, and where we treat with compassion those who are in trouble among us.	No
26504	I know they've appointed a commission to look at managed care.	No
33595	I firmly believe that we must have an education system that starts with kindergarten and goes through university.	No
1231	And this administration, which has been in office for two or more years, has still not taken bold and energetic steps to put an end to the proliferation of nuclear waste in the world, especially plutonium.	Yes
21833	Ross was very articulated across the country.	No
16722	There should be a full-time atomic energy specialist, independent of the electricity company in the control room, full-time, twenty-four hours a day, to close a plant if an anomaly develops.	No
29289	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	No
29810	I'd like to answer that.	No
7754	I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.	Yes
14097	There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.	No
32998	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	Yes
34410	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	Yes
10596	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	No
10387	That's what I've been doing for four years.	No
29235	It was largely because of tax policies that reduced taxes on the rich, didn't invest in the middle class, took Wall Street's eyes off, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
20465	This is a major problem for America.	No
19486	Then, when we had the ban on assault weapons in the Senate, Senator Dole fought bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost dropped the entire crime bill because the Rifle National Association did not want the ban on assault weapons, just as they did not want the Brady bill.	Yes
13993	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	No
11246	We tend to be reactive.	No
17786	Now, Social Security, let's rest once and for all.	No
15967	It was a bipartite commission, a study of two respected economists, which indicated that we could raise some $40, 45, 50 billion of these funds.	Yes
11695	And the confidence that these countries recovered from the wounds of war by having troops there.	No
18123	And our alliance is strong.	No
11722	I mean, we're gonna have some kind of American nation building core?	No
20904	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	No
19844	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	Yes
7119	And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	No
9599	That's not what you did in this generation.	No
19202	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a rate of employment growth faster than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	Yes
25574	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	No
3602	But let's go back to the original point.	No
914	I mean, there are huge opportunities to expand markets and build a solid future for our farmers.	No
17730	It's given us the biggest failure of small businesses in 50 years.	Yes
19409	The most strongly directed, decorated weld in uniform when he retired.	No
5730	Even FOX News disputes this, and this does not happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	Yes
810	25 December, Mr. Vice-President.	No
14189	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	No
32359	I just mean...	No
34205	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	No
15405	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	No
23089	And it was the President's fiscal policies that led to the biggest deficits in American history.	Yes
12429	I don't use that language and I don't think we should.	No
21032	It has been anticipated that they could probably crush the $900 billion budget.	Yes
24588	But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	No
15392	I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	No
24920	That is why I am opposed to the secret action in Nicaragua.	No
14862	And we have made it clear that working with our allies and others, we are prepared to deal with any foreseeable futures that could interrupt trade with this crucial region of the world.	No
18235	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	No
21089	You should put it in prudent and safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to $3 trillion.	No
2874	Immediately before the Kansas City Congress, he added another $8 billion to the defence budget.	Yes
13398	What do we do?	No
1679	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	No
18986	"I mean, it was the president who said, ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said, ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight cheap war -- none of which was true."	Yes
13750	I want the veto.	No
26723	One of my most proud moments was the signing of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says that the government must bow backwards before we interferons in religious practice.	No
12889	Under the Soviet weapon, with the Soviet troops there, it is in a very difficult position to take something independent, a position that would be independent of the Soviet Union.	No
25927	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that this trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	No
3789	I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	Yes
24955	A President must know these things.	No
15991	The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	No
7018	And we will make any necessary adjustments.	No
10609	And Senator McCain voted for four of George Bush's five budgets.	Yes
27904	People will look it up.	No
29034	I didn't spend the last quarter of a century looking for personal wealth.	No
32111	What about the other 15,000?	No
20465	This is a major problem facing America.	No
24647	Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	Yes
7721	When he chose his deputy to the vice-chair, he chose a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who was currently opposed to them.	Yes
21333	I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	No
17007	Our economic strength is still there.	No
27098	We organized the Friends of Syria.	No
23721	"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off."""	No
2289	And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.	Yes
10804	He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	Yes
8740	I agree with what I think is the main premise of your question, Sir, that we will have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	No
28255	I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	No
20646	And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	No
6048	We have to do both, and that's exactly what my plan is doing.	Yes
12847	The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.	Yes
17763	And give us a plan.	No
34281	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	No
2505	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	Yes
21823	Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this, but Hawaii does.	No
8066	What is at stake here is the question of leadership for everyone free.	No
18061	And so, today, we are 90 per cent of the victims and 90 per cent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, schools, construction, prescription drugs for seniors, and that's Iraq.	Yes
3591	Now, Senator Obama has not mentioned that, with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending for new programs.	Yes
19272	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	Yes
32664	She's talking for the rebels.	Yes
8354	As he pointed out, we came to Congress the same year.	No
12572	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice-President.	No
6788	My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.	No
3749	Let me tell you another place to look for savings.	No
19500	Speaking of that and that.	No
3753	Some of this money is in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
32340	How do you do that?	No
16666	I don't know where that money comes from.	No
23962	Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.	Yes
17568	They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	Yes
165	Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.	No
9891	People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their children have even bigger dreams than they do.	No
11947	I agree with that, and I supported this law.	No
12010	Secondly, I don't think we should sell weapons to people who shouldn't have them.	No
29836	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	Yes
928	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	No
29857	I'd just like to answer.	No
1747	Middle-income families are crushed.	No
21123	This is double the rate of return of the current Social Security Trust.	Yes
11646	My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	No
13710	4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	Yes
20776	Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.	No
26688	And now, what we have to do is focus on the things we're really good at and make sure we get a fair deal.	No
29580	You know, I made a mistake using a private email.	No
494	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	No
20614	I think that's the wrong thing.	No
26416	Let's look at the facts.	No
22564	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	Yes
17591	The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	No
17370	I've said it's going to take some work.	No
13394	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	Yes
23859	I've had a lot of experience in dealing with ordinary people over the past year and month.	No
3424	I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	No
29548	Let her release the e-mails.	No
29596	And you should go down and take a look at that.	No
18003	I've shown the American people I know how to lead.	No
15791	I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	No
8070	People have to decide.	No
26810	There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	No
26486	It's just a small example.	No
16543	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill mentioned by Mr. Gannon, in the last two tax bills, we will have increased the minimum tax on all rich taxpayers.	Yes
19828	I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	No
34152	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	No
8746	We will have to develop better Community transport systems, so that with buses and light rail we can replace private cars in places where they are clearly not energy efficient.	No
19889	If we want to stop the crime and pregnancy of teenage girls, let's start with education.	No
16811	One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	Yes
30088	How do we protect our people?	No
6909	We allow you -- if you choose, you don't need it -- but we're giving you wider competition to buy in the same health care plan as senators and members of Congress give themselves.	Yes
25536	I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	No
33098	This is one of the most consecutive elections we have had.	No
10835	You know that he came to the Senate and that he never proposed legislation to do so?	Yes
17446	Now, which I would like to see in any judge and in any matter relating to human life.	No
19553	But if we go in the right direction and America leads, we're better.	No
10051	But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	Yes
17908	And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	No
20462	We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.	No
10872	And it is absolutely essential that we understand that this is not just a challenge, it is an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can easily create five million new jobs here in the United States.	No
12548	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy, the strongest nation in the world militarily, has admitted, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we always have enough strength so that, no matter what our potential adversaries have - if we have to launch a surprise attack - we can destroy their ability to wage war.	Yes
19472	And I think it's a good idea, has strong bipartite support.	No
8662	The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.	No
7504	We can have health care for all Americans.	No
29461	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	No
16870	And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	No
14318	So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	Yes
10741	And the last point I just want to say.	No
26402	The president exempts the IRS, which creates three-quarters of the paperwork.	Yes
33872	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	Yes
34102	I've got no illusions about that.	No
22372	A message won't do it.	No
15268	And I'd like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	No
839	And I think he'll be remarkable.	No
5813	And I think MP Lewis' argument was that we need to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	No
10828	Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	No
25905	I think they will, and I think we will.	No
28294	I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	No
16610	This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	No
17906	I believe there is a fundamental fairness that must be achieved in our tax system.	No
15369	Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	Yes
13400	So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	No
24361	I would say that if you want to continue to be the most favoured nation for your public and private industries, respect human rights in the future.	No
28967	You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	Yes
13696	I'll give you an example.	No
28132	For 24 years, I've never been afraid to accept the big drug companies.	Yes
23594	I agree with Judge Potter Stewart's standard.	No
18591	You cannot change the dynamics on the ground if you have criticized the courageous leader of Iraq.	No
20892	Because it is the cornerstone of reform in the state of Texas.	No
27360	And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	No
33318	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	No
28474	In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.	Yes
5813	And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	No
19775	He is troubled, like me, by certain things that are happening today.	No
29668	I'll give you an example.	No
1552	We have peace with freedom.	No
2315	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	No
10885	Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
16031	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	No
5807	Of course, I talked to people like Joe the plumber and told him I'm not going to spread his wealth.	No
13526	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	Yes
32647	But you were in touch... excuse me.	No
19837	The ones that are out there are doing well.	No
24379	And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	No
14915	We have also planned a youth employment programme that would include 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
14755	You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.	No
4408	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	No
13974	Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	No
18311	They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.	No
4145	The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	No
17201	First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	No
14888	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	Yes
13239	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	No
33841	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	Yes
21845	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	No
24829	Investing in U.S. jobs, U.S. education, controlling health care costs, bringing this country together again.	No
28348	We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	No
18088	He hoped we'd turn away.	No
23640	In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	Yes
7807	This we must get across to the world.	No
16121	But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	No
8723	But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	No
8526	I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.	No
23710	These munitions are now being used against our children.	No
24034	Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	No
26062	You got two years to look for a job.	No
24417	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	No
19548	Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.	Yes
17489	But how does this compare to the problem of a woman being raped?	No
28057	We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	Yes
9609	We did it by taking $60 billion that went to banks and lenders as intermediaries for the student loan program, and we said, we're just going to cut off the intermediary.	Yes
6800	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	No
30371	You must be able to negotiate our trade agreements.	No
21746	Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	No
17885	The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	No
27709	In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	Yes
23655	So you have to have a legal intervention.	No
27924	You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
27592	In the same way as you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you are for that, although it depends.	Yes
25744	Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.	No
33870	But I'm going to tell you what's not fictitious are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, after receiving a U.S. Congress subpoena.	Yes
28165	First of all, these are the measures I would like to take.	No
5794	Senator McCain's campaign publicly stated last week that if we continue to talk about the economic crisis, we lose, so we have to change the subject.	Yes
29526	I said, do you get audited?	No
5580	Then, Exxon Mobil, who made $12 billion, record profits, in the last few quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families that hurt there -- they try to figure out how they're going to buy food, how they're going to save for their kids' education in college, they need a break.	Yes
19443	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	No
7936	I am talking about our will to bear any burden in order to maintain our own freedom and to respond to our freedom throughout the world.	No
1979	Governor Romney mentioned the Bowles-Simpson Commission earlier.	No
15110	And we've been guilty of that.	No
16542	But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.	Yes
23135	He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.	No
29655	And we need to be very clear about that.	No
4121	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the severe sanctions that Senator McCain has just mentioned.	No
21408	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	No
23171	You're right, what matters is a plan.	No
13899	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	No
14707	I just believe it's time to change.	No
25969	That's the drugs.	No
1848	And we have a difference, however, in the definitions of small businesses.	No
19562	It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	Yes
7819	Now, the bill that the Speaker introduced would have provided more assistance to the regions that really needed it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the West Virginia regions - than Senator Kennedy supported.	Yes
28439	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	No
25923	A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	No
28196	They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	No
3172	We have 500,000 more unemployed Americans today than three months ago.	Yes
8430	I favor higher salaries for teachers.	No
24841	The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	Yes
25481	Let's take the principle of your warhead.	No
14567	I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
33886	He sued Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died in the service of our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	Yes
33223	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	Yes
1141	It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	No
10160	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	Yes
8803	We had a help - 46% of those who enlisted in the voluntary army until 1977 said they did it for a particular reason, the G.I.	Yes
12891	This should continue and it can be intensified to give them hope and to keep alive the hope of freedom that I can testify that they have so deeply in them.	No
6531	Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	Yes
23637	I think there should be laws on parental notification.	No
5766	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	No
12259	The book you mentioned that Vice-President Gore wrote, he also called for the imposition -- big taxes on energy to clean the environment.	Yes
24044	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	No
24068	It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	Yes
27917	I couldn't agree more about the future, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	No
33464	Now we can talk about Putin.	No
3585	That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	No
488	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	No
26263	I repeat, think of the law on disabled Americans.	No
16284	In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	No
9548	And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, Candy -- it blows up the deficit because keeping in mind, it's just to pay the extra expenses he's talking about, seven trillion dollars - eight trillion dollars before even reaching the deficit we already have.	Yes
2218	And if the government can be as effective as the private sector and offer premiums as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get a traditional health insurance plan or they will be able to get a private plan.	No
6577	Now I'm gonna reverse that.	No
21070	I object.	No
1348	This has not proved effective and, therefore, I think the best way to prosecute the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in possession of a weapon and uses that weapon for part of his criminal activity.	No
31941	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	No
22139	We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	No
1034	I think we could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and work, and say we have voluntary price restrictions.	No
15227	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	Yes
33031	There is a thing called clean coal.	No
28711	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year and a half ago, and yet if she forgives me, when she was little, she brought in a home disk that had horrible words in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	No
32903	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	No
27608	But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	No
21767	Send us some people that will pass the idea.	No
23241	But let me tell you where we were.	No
24368	We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.	Yes
13293	I do not suggest in any way, or have ever, that this indicates that Mr Nixon has any sympathy, involvement, or in any way implies inferences towards the Ku Klux Klan.	No
149	And the presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we must control the Congress of Democrats.	No
2321	We have entered and had the most difficult reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	Yes
7924	I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	No
2092	And in one year, you've provided $90 billion in breaks to the world of green energy.	Yes
7766	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	No
20019	And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	No
30090	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	No
10852	And let's keep -- never forget the struggle the Americans are in today.	No
1974	Now, we all know that we've got to do more.	No
32911	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	No
8363	There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	No
3184	But I'm committed to the one in Portsmouth, Ohio.	No
23860	I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	No
4120	President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	Yes
22248	And we put up with that.	No
707	You have to make choices.	No
11931	And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	No
11883	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	No
8544	In fact, your question raises an issue that I am very pleased to highlight.	No
33883	So we know what he said and what he did to women.	No
6239	In a way, it can be difficult to reconcile the two points of view.	No
26089	We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	No
12191	So it's not a matter of his heart, as far as I know.	No
33810	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	No
7663	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me sum up by saying: why speak every time I'm in the South about civil rights?	No
14177	A third of the president's budget is at the discretion of the president, or really of Congress, since they own every penny and tell a president how to spend every penny.	Yes
8885	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	No
10032	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	Yes
23373	Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.	No
12673	And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom wins; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society win.	No
15703	They wouldn't be in the budget, but you want one now?	No
12520	And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	No
19289	Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.	Yes
25117	We were there for the better part of a year.	No
32766	Well, Martha, I hope that when I... if I'm lucky...	No
9074	Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	Yes
6013	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	No
23602	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	No
19100	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	Yes
21871	And as a private citizen, believe me, you're considered a major nuisance.	No
25966	He just says all these states -- he made it illegal for children to smoke.	No
3593	I want to cut spending.	No
13930	Let's think it through here.	No
12775	I don't think colour television is as important as rocket thrust.	No
2221	I'd rather have an insurance company.	No
28584	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have a smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in the line because you can get cheaper, better, faster online services.	No
7903	The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.	No
7745	That's a test of prestige.	No
33167	But these are statements that should never, never have been made.	No
25587	That's key to the strength of our nation.	No
19955	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	No
20069	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	No
26053	And three of those checks were those of my grandparents.	No
9880	The children of those who have come here illegally, these children, I think, should have a way to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for example, is a way that they would have that kind of way to become a permanent resident.	No
24492	I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	No
34155	Once again, Donald suggests that he did not support the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
8350	And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	No
27073	This is the way for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which, of course, threatens our ally, Israel.	No
24239	I think the American people are ready to act.	No
21397	We must control this growth with inflation and population growth, but not increase taxes on the American people now.	No
29889	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, a highly respected journalist to McClatchy, Kenya, to find out.	Yes
15237	The mines are closed; there are 22000 miners without work.	Yes
4350	"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""	Yes
15591	And it's grossly unfair for the average American who pays his taxes and pays them on time and has no other choice: he's withdrawn from his pay.	No
6053	And they were desperate to get coverage, because, of course, they're worried that if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	No
34176	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	No
18816	We will commit more over time to help.	No
17033	Over the past few years, the government has grown larger; the industry has grown larger; the unions have grown larger; and our children have been victims of mass education.	No
25417	Why do I support the freeze?	No
8242	I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.	No
23127	Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	Yes
18294	And I'm going to lead these troops to victory.	No
33040	They'll pay off our national debt.	No
8514	The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.	Yes
17819	Many people are predicting a recession.	No
10925	It is breaking family budgets.	No
26029	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have an agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	No
23138	First, he says he is in favour of reform of medical responsibility, especially for OB/GYNs.	Yes
24465	I am dismayed by the largest number of scandalous divorces -- it happens in families, it happened in ours.	No
181	More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.	Yes
20798	Take for example the marriage penalty.	No
2366	And the number of small businesses I went to say they're giving up insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is simply prohibitive.	No
17202	In mine, I believe in people and I believe that people are supposed to dominate our society -- that they, not the government, must have control over their own affairs as much as possible, with an orderly society.	No
22033	Everyone knows how to fix them.	No
27296	... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	No
21852	I feel like you're going to get a government prize.	No
18629	I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	No
31928	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	No
28461	We defend these values and must be ready to assert them.	No
15176	First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	No
32494	And it's, like, no growth.	No
20017	I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	No
1282	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	Yes
6175	"You chose not to do so because you feared the appointment of ""conservative judges""."	No
33941	I think that would be a great gesture.	No
17859	Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	Yes
3176	So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	No
2161	But on Medicare, for current retirees, it cuts $716 billion from the program.	Yes
12541	Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	No
668	Look at the INF treaty.	No
7189	I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	No
25240	It's a question of leadership.	No
25609	America and the Americans don't just decide what's going on in this country.	No
22146	You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	No
23899	I think the American people should be the judge of that.	No
17859	Personal earnings after per capita taxes increased by almost $3,000 over the four years.	Yes
21165	I want to focus on results.	No
18985	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	No
13323	Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	No
27480	There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.	No
11566	When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	Yes
6706	Bob, anyone can play with those votes.	No
20430	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	No
25831	We still have to cover about 20 million people and many children.	Yes
33950	We have the highest score of guard dogs following the foundations.	Yes
24171	Let's get the American people to work, and build the kind of high-tech economy, high-wage, high-growth that the American people deserve.	No
33691	It won't work.	No
24709	I am the president who has risen and said, do not ruin social security, and I am not going and we have not, and we are not going to seek the beneficiary of social security.	Yes
6098	Here's your fine -- zero.	No
22	And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.	No
13871	That's one of the things I want to change.	No
16770	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	Yes
25070	I'll tell you where we disagree.	No
31896	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	No
9624	Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	No
27480	There are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people around the world for a better life.	No
26335	Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	Yes
15284	The rest, as to whether the land will be open in the next five years, we are already five years behind in what we should do.	No
17028	It was a great opportunity.	No
11891	There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	No
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
17212	Now, with respect to my feeling about why I thought his case was about his ability to bring us back to the same things we knew under the previous administration, his case is that he spoke several times in praise of the deficits, said that they should not be abhorred -- that, in fact, he said at some point that he wanted the deficit to be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and help reduce unemployment.	Yes
15389	While I was governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate cases of discrimination against women in the body of Californian law, and I had passed and signed 14 laws that eliminated these discriminations, including the economic laws you just mentioned - equal pay, etc.	Yes
17464	It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	Yes
21486	I don't want to...	No
12837	In other words, we can negotiate many of these points of difference between us without going to the top.	No
21771	Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	No
16563	The first out of thirty-eight presidents who ever resigned from a public service under pressure.	Yes
1378	And, in addition to this, has put forward a proposal that has been adopted and used throughout my own selection mandate of - for all judges and prosecutors or prosecutors, on the basis of merit.	Yes
6587	I have a manufacturing jobs credit.	No
26933	Keep in mind that I and the Americans have taken the lead in organizing an international coalition that has ensured that we can, without putting troops on the ground for less than what we spent in Iraq in two weeks, free a country that has been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	Yes
15630	(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	No
28447	It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.	No
18236	And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	No
1808	So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	No
12697	We cut off important items that the Cuban regime needs to survive.	No
30096	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	Yes
23242	The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	Yes
12797	But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	No
27772	We want a world that's stable.	No
14820	I never want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives in sandy beachheads in the Pacific, rice fields and jungles in Asia or on Europe's muddy battlefields.	No
11983	Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.	No
12948	I served it during the war.	No
22310	Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	No
10760	That is how we ensure that everyone is ready to make some sacrifices.	No
22213	Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.	No
6550	If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	No
29600	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	Yes
23247	He lost $1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
24264	We live in a global economy, not a national one.	No
640	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	No
21407	It is not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it is not the Democrats' fault.	No
6167	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	No
22414	No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	No
14989	And that was where President Carter promised that he would put in place a broad program to rebuild that ministry.	Yes
1370	But it's as far away as I'd go with it.	No
19646	We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.	No
18040	And they believe it because they know that I would not have removed my eye from the goal: Osama bin Laden.	No
22582	That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	No
3185	The governor also spoke of morality in foreign policy.	No
33481	It's clear you're not gonna admit...	No
19450	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	No
515	I know what has happened in the last eight years.	No
16492	So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.	No
25595	I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	No
32414	Well, I think I should answer, because -- so ridiculous.	No
1297	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	Yes
28426	Medicare -- I voted to add 26 years to Medicare's life.	Yes
2114	So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	No
8953	And what's funny is that California, which is normally above the national average for inflation and unemployment, for the first six years, was below the national average for inflation and unemployment.	Yes
24555	And if we can't love each other, we should get along.	No
29537	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	No
15459	I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	Yes
32633	I took Putin and others, and I would do so as president.	No
16918	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	Yes
11858	So racial profiling is not just a problem in local police forces.	No
6253	We will do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	No
32339	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	Yes
33638	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	No
18205	There's a lot of good people working hard.	No
1447	Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
29951	And I looked at the way you're talking now about how beautiful everything is and how wonderful you are.	No
8075	They're going to move her forward faster, and they're going to move her forward more surely than in her program.	No
1889	But I think math, common sense and our history show us that this is not a recipe for job growth.	No
7840	We have passed a bill on the redevelopment of areas that is much more effective than the bill that the Administration proposed on two occasions, and the President vetoed it twice.	Yes
34140	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	No
1057	But they didn't come to the position of president, and in hindsight, I wouldn't have given this interview if I had done it - I had done it - I did it again.	No
16168	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	No
7725	And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	No
17477	I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	No
24761	He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	Yes
15772	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets continued to deploy, and then we negotiated from the force.	Yes
16750	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	No
5611	I didn't make a promise about...	No
6583	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	Yes
11667	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	No
3070	Our allies think we've neglected them.	No
25497	And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	No
27281	And those teachers can make a difference.	No
19956	Well, the president can define himself anyway he wants, but I think we need to look at the file.	No
8923	I'd like to stay here and promise a tax cut to the American people, as Governor Reagan did.	No
17895	Are we better off with this arms race?	No
8484	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	No
1420	Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	No
15053	With regard to the major progress made with public spending, the unemployment rate for Blacks in Detroit (Michigan) is 56 per cent.	Yes
32010	"He never apologized to the federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said that he could not be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, citing, ""Mexico."""	Yes
2317	You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.	No
16602	For example, we now have - in the area of health - three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, and sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	Yes
19299	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	No
9310	As for something like coal, we made the biggest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even if we produce more coal, we produce it cleaner and smarter.	Yes
3046	The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.	No
8209	What's the net result of this?	No
22008	It's still the most respected credit.	No
22334	This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	No
17581	And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	Yes
6673	They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	No
20987	In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	No
1657	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	No
6117	The elderly, the less healthy people, what will eventually happen is that you will be the only ones remaining in your employer-based system, your employers will not be able to afford it.	No
33877	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	No
314	My parents came to this country as immigrants.	No
27997	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	No
1367	I've always been a hunter and I have shotguns, rifles and a handgun.	No
746	We must be hard on international terrorism.	No
14469	These crooks -- now Willie Sutton would have owned a savings and a loan rather than stealing banks, because he stole banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and a loan is where the money was.	No
7338	He's a president who didn't meet the Black Congress caucus.	Yes
31906	And we should move on to much bigger and much bigger things.	No
22157	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	No
15922	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	No
31961	She wants them to vote, and she doesn't do anything, and then she comes back four years later.	No
11762	So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	No
20741	I am going to veto anything that takes money from social security or health insurance for anything other than social security or health insurance.	No
16862	I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.	No
19665	It looks great, but it's very bad.	No
16616	Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	Yes
24691	Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	No
881	And I'm very very proud of that choice.	No
12223	But if you want change, you need to find someone who knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to do positive things for America.	No
23636	My opponent voted against the ban.	Yes
3994	And we have a choice.	No
23079	I would like to remind you that it was not only my administration that made the security decision.	No
21715	I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.	No
17670	And it's a wonderful thing to see when you go there among people.	No
2399	They must let you keep your child in their insurance -- your insurance plan until you are 26 years old.	Yes
17209	I don't want to hear them.	No
19669	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	Yes
7591	In fact, in his book The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	No
23166	Seriously, labels don't mean anything.	No
19801	And the truth is, America is very bad.	No
18362	Actually, he forgot Poland.	No
28161	That adds up to 44 million people.	Yes
28683	Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	No
18905	Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.	Yes
7581	First of all, I disagree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and that China was certainly lost when that administration came into power in 1953.	No
13958	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	No
8549	Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.	Yes
24237	But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	No
11581	I think it is important for NATO to be strong and confident.	No
14568	"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	No
20429	I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	No
15489	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	No
26362	I only have 30 seconds.	No
10658	I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	No
7821	So, point one, at the highest priority, we need to get a bill for the regions depressed by the next Congress.	No
28631	The President should not have vetoed this bill.	No
25775	They were presidents at historic times.	No
16610	It's a huge waste of money, a hard and competent management of the government, which gives us a simple and efficient, objective and manageable government, it would be a big step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it will be done.	No
24605	I think we show good compassion and concern.	No
27124	We should have played a leading role, not at the military level, but at the organizational level, at the government level, in bringing the parties together, in finding responsible parties.	No
17366	I think, as you do, the American people will come more and more to our cause.	No
15758	But we can't keep living on a credit card.	No
4120	President Bush recently sent a high-level ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with Europeans on the issue of nuclear weapons.	Yes
27770	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	Yes
13409	Anyone who says America has been motionless for seven and a half years has not travelled around America.	No
11304	And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	No
13340	I suggested giving the president other weapons to protect the national interest in the event of a national emergency strike beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	Yes
13818	You need to free the private sector.	No
1986	That means Governor Romney...	No
19099	Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	No
2968	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	No
8725	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	Yes
9448	The 5 per cent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 per cent of the income tax collected by the nation.	Yes
23367	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	Yes
15263	As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.	Yes
19665	Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.	No
26605	I'm not suggesting that it be done, but at least we should look at it.	No
26348	Now we have a majority and we have a president.	No
13903	But it is good for America to improve energy efficiency.	No
24436	But I think it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done outside of that, and that we have interests there.	No
28800	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	No
19330	You put a lot of business people out of business.	No
25415	I do not agree with an agreement in which the security of the United States has not been fully recognized and supported.	No
16658	But it doesn't cost anything about the federal treasury anymore.	Yes
13092	I ask him to appoint a Republican president who led this nation to war.	No
25892	I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	Yes
26682	There are American jobs that are being lost.	No
19687	I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	No
30430	And I'll tell you that, Lester: That's not nice.	No
13374	"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""	No
30075	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	No
6952	We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	Yes
14657	Also I got a philosophical difference.	No
23102	It's in my health-care proposal.	Yes
12127	So it's one of my top priorities.	No
25603	I remember the day before I was appointed to the vice-presidency.	No
22141	Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.	Yes
5766	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	No
12897	If we can pass this on to the people of these countries, in this decade of the 1960s, the struggle for freedom will be won.	No
33093	I don't agree with almost everything he says or does, but I respect that.	No
21497	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	No
18100	But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.	No
7067	And we will continue to do so over the next four years.	No
30144	Now it's in more than 30 countries.	Yes
25032	And it now ends this term without any progress towards arms control, but with a very dangerous arms race going on instead.	Yes
5549	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	No
13398	Now, what do we do about it?	No
7251	I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	No
33594	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	No
7850	If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.	No
32163	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	Yes
24325	They don't go to war with each other.	No
18753	The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	Yes
12709	The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	No
32584	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
29119	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	No
10067	But she works for me.	No
29496	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	No
13155	We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	No
28510	It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.	No
13702	It's not a dirty campaign because he's been talking about my record for half a year here, 11 months here.	No
22270	It's your tax money that's wasted.	No
17038	My mother and father, during the depression, worked very hard to give me the opportunity to do better in our great country.	No
29573	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	No
11663	And these are my four main priorities if I were to be the president, not to say that we will not be engaged or work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	No
13927	We cannot lose those jobs.	No
32803	She called it the gold standard.	Yes
24090	I'm not playing Lawrence Welk tonight.	No
13468	I object for the reasons I mentioned.	No
15663	And in the process the negatives started.	No
14198	It wasn't a way to pay back the deficit.	No
33389	There will also necessarily be new technologies and the best way to deploy them.	No
21728	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, the use of teenagers is declining, significantly, 60% over the last two years.	Yes
15608	(Applause) And so I still don't know if it's for or against the tax increase.	No
3887	And peace comes to the land, and prosperity.	No
12543	He encourages them to start a war.	No
21248	And for those of you who work, thank you from the bottom of my heart.	No
3777	We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.	No
21116	Let me tell you what your plan is.	No
24323	Finally, we should promote democratic impulses throughout the world.	No
12889	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	No
12970	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
7782	We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.	Yes
24750	I'm tired of being told we can't.	No
19566	That would be my position.	No
2201	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	Yes
9760	We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	Yes
24542	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	No
17805	That's why I want another 4 years.	No
32103	And so please, go to...	No
17614	And what did you do right after the election?	No
32271	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	Yes
33467	If we got along well, that would be good.	No
20308	Then you go to your pharmacy.	No
9760	We have created five million jobs, and we have left 800 jobs lost a month, and we are making progress.	Yes
20871	The guy who served us lunch gave me a letter today.	No
17820	And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	No
2920	It's the president's responsibility.	No
17570	As soon as the economy is on solid ground, I would like to see the total repeal of indexation.	No
5899	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes in the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a difficult economy.	No
19738	The Middle East is very difficult.	No
21697	Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	Yes
26485	And this composite will now be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica highway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	Yes
3012	Our priorities should be first to meet our own military needs, then to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	No
27438	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that is unacceptable.	No
11573	Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	No
3358	Do we have a world of hunger and hatred, and are we going to live in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that has been drawn around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	No
33321	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	No
22913	And many of our military are underpaid.	Yes
2623	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	No
17186	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	No
10571	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	No
8223	We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.	No
28166	I will commit to providing high-quality health care coverage that is affordable for every child in America within four years.	No
21572	I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.	Yes
21505	Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.	No
718	I'm not reconsidering my position.	No
24462	So I do think we need to strengthen family.	No
8404	As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	No
3225	South Korea is facing a very delicate situation.	No
8347	Sometimes my advice has been taken.	No
29286	You can't bring back work.	No
24729	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	No
14022	Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.	Yes
3628	Well, let me just make a couple of points.	No
24289	I hope we can talk more about it.	No
25415	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	No
21684	And I think the press would follow this so closely that they would probably do so.	No
1581	And our cancer rate is higher than any country in the world.	Yes
25110	But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	Yes
1112	Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	No
2289	And what happened with a part of the law that was passed during the president's term of office, you saw the regulation become excessive, and it hurts -- it hurts the economy.	Yes
12326	It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	Yes
18709	And that is, I would not join the International Criminal Court.	No
14029	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so inclined, the first thing you should do is say, guys, if you like these things so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	No
12915	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	No
8326	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	Yes
7672	He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.	No
25037	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	No
622	But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	No
15059	There is no doubt in my mind that in the central cities of the city centre, with the new commitment to an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuel program, solar energy, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs that will pay rich dividends.	No
26367	Senator Dole led the opposition.	No
25572	A president, in order to defend that country and obtain arms control, must control what is happening.	No
18349	Well, there are summits being held.	No
3544	It's completely uncontrollable.	No
629	But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	No
30279	I think once the nuclear alternative arrives, it's over.	No
24539	We need a hundred thousand more police on the street.	No
11402	Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	No
15802	In many cases, it is people in the community who are examples and models.	No
3635	It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	No
32913	Who's gonna... the famous thing, we're gonna answer our call at 3:00 in the morning.	No
13011	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	Yes
1421	Yes, it was announced that real GDP growth in the third quarter was 4 per cent.	Yes
21481	You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --	No
15256	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give this basket to the big oil companies.	No
16540	I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	No
32135	And it wasn't over at all.	No
7048	Sure, there's more work to do.	No
21588	I'll be happy to take care of it.	No
33888	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	Yes
21784	So that's how I feel, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	No
27125	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, insurgents are very disparate.	No
21491	Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	No
28593	But that's the good news.	No
26195	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.	No
16311	That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	No
21254	And we have a very important decision to make.	No
7858	The question is what we are going to do in the future.	No
27678	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	No
7279	I thought we should extend the ban on assault weapons, and I was told that the bill would never move, because the Republicans and Democrats were against the ban on assault weapons, the people of both parties.	Yes
6797	And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	No
2428	Similarly, a study by McKinsey and Company of American business stated that 30 percent of them anticipate a decline in coverage.	Yes
1712	We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.	Yes
2746	We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.	Yes
5566	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	No
8321	I think this is the wrong direction.	No
34346	He was criticizing President Reagan.	Yes
8244	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	No
2730	Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	No
24437	After all, there are 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since the Second World War, and there can be hundreds of thousands of people who will die of hunger or cold this winter.	Yes
2909	In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	Yes
26068	It costs Californian taxpayers $3 billion a year.	Yes
19351	We've done about everything, we're the reform party, the Republican Party.	No
654	And, therefore, I am encouraged by what I see when I speak to Mr. -- what I hear when I speak to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they do so.	No
19807	But I think my ideas are better for the future.	No
3236	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	No
21473	But that's how I feel.	No
20029	But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.	No
32627	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they will not come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage on them.	No
23495	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	No
3355	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three fundamental elements: leadership, respect for our country's principles and appropriate priorities and commitments for the future.	No
6660	What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.	No
3014	And the expedition of Spruance class destroyers to Iran is much more sophisticated than the Spruance class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Marine.	Yes
11858	So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	No
22752	Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.	No
15295	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a group of experts to examine the whole of this problem on how it can be reformed and made actuarially valid, but on the assumption that no one currently depends on social security will bring the carpet out of underwear and not gain control.	No
32171	It's the highest we've ever been in our country.	Yes
14637	Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.	No
15705	I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	No
14255	Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	Yes
28364	And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.	No
24583	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	No
26850	If we move a million people from social assistance to work.	No
22195	The programs we've tried where you control everything and Washington's mandate don't work.	No
22100	Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	Yes
22729	I know how these people think.	No
27262	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	No
28907	You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	No
28466	When I graduated from college, there were a lot of fancy ways to get out and be part of it.	No
11309	If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	No
34354	In fact, I think just the opposite.	No
25529	We must be clear that we are for human freedom.	No
20685	My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	No
19113	Thank you, Mr. President, for these kind words.	No
25706	And thank you to the people of San Diego for giving us the opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we are all facing in front of the people who will make the decision.	No
24311	and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	No
27556	And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.	No
23113	You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.	Yes
22494	I am the only person here who has ever balanced a government budget and I have presented 12 and cut spending several times.	Yes
14477	I'm an adult, I can take care of it, I'll pay for it.	No
4038	"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	Yes
11000	Number one, let me repeat, if you have a health care plan you like, you can keep it.	Yes
7426	I tried to find common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	No
30210	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	Yes
19936	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	No
32405	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	No
15294	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	Yes
16475	And I recommended it to Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have allowed us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.	Yes
9194	If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.	Yes
15926	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	No
22553	Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	No
20313	One thing I don't understand, Jim, is why the richest 1% get their tax cuts in the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they have a single penny?	Yes
2025	That's why the National Federation of Independent Enterprises said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	Yes
14843	Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.	Yes
24730	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	No
17402	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	Yes
17672	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	No
13460	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	No
16893	They have too many employees.	No
11838	And other Americans have been identified because of their race or ethnicity.	Yes
22198	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	No
6769	I fully respect their point of view.	No
33013	But I think there should be full background checks, and we should close the weapon's loophole, and close the loophole online.	No
11828	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	No
24374	We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	Yes
22565	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	Yes
22451	Now we come back to when the mother is pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	No
33934	Saudi Arabia is giving $25 million, Qatar, all these countries.	Yes
755	Yeah, we shouldn't trade weapons for hostages.	No
18590	When he came, after giving a speech to Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	No
29246	Independent experts reviewed what I proposed and discussed what Donald proposed, and basically they said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt of more than $5 trillion and in some cases put middle class families at a disadvantage compared to the rich, would come into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and could have another recession.	Yes
27086	Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	No
6783	As far as religion is concerned, as I said, I grew up Catholic.	No
549	But it's not going to be dedicated by a federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	No
27254	We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	No
2829	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	No
25050	I believe that the essential strategy of the United States should not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	No
29022	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	No
626	But look, let me sum it up.	No
19873	And you choose 20,000, whether or not they need the money, and they're paid for volunteering.	Yes
19994	And not about personal things.	No
22103	I think we will have a permanent responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to remain involved.	No
20081	The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	No
17856	The first half of year 84 is up 81/2 percent.	Yes
20577	Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	No
21861	Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	Yes
28949	Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	Yes
24281	So, we have two that I'd put as number one.	No
15964	But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	Yes
139	Massachusetts does not have a huge defence budget, but nevertheless, the governor has increased taxes five times different.	Yes
19375	You know, mine doesn't work that way.	No
3746	The problem with an expense freeze is that you use an axe where you need a scalpel.	No
30231	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
34403	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	No
20173	I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	No
24998	Now, they claim they're not.	Yes
3593	I want to cut spending.	No
26261	I am not in favour of equal results, but I am in favour of everyone having a chance to prove that they are competent.	No
12602	It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.	Yes
24322	We need to rebuild America's strength at home.	No
78	But we must also take the demand seriously.	No
8130	I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	No
10259	I know what it takes for this to happen, and my plan will do it, and part of it is to ensure that China continues to play according to the rules.	No
9483	The only reason this doesn't happen is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress held the 98 percent hostages because they want tax relief for the top 2 percent.	Yes
33989	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate that he did not pay a cent of federal income tax.	Yes
33378	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
12368	It was certainly not the attitude that took place to the west, however.	No
10118	But there were too many cases during my presidency, where I had to comfort families who lost someone.	No
25536	I think we have observed ourselves and done our best to see that human rights are being extended around the world.	No
25640	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	No
18687	No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	Yes
22727	Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	No
8514	The proposal presented by you and Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred million dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he did not agree at all with the funding, said he should be on social security.	Yes
8548	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	Yes
15683	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	No
2576	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	No
32518	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	No
30202	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	No
20058	So I'd rather talk about my strength.	No
6638	The wages of Americans have gone down.	Yes
13595	But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	No
27795	And, you know, that's... you're right.	No
7112	He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	No
27884	...you've had the floor for a while.	No
33711	The report was so bad.	No
31896	Can you imagine the people who, frankly, do so well against us with ISIS?	No
17139	These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	No
12993	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	Yes
7152	And if we did that, we would have more consumer capacity in America, which is what we need right now to get our economy on track.	No
23059	Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	No
29230	We have to stop them from leaving.	No
976	And the best America is not behind us.	No
13374	"Now, as far as his numbers are concerned here tonight, he's engaged again in this, what I'd call, mirror game of ""here-is-is-is-not."""	No
17371	I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	No
24002	So we really need to rebuild our base of work.	No
10271	The problem is, they'll be in China.	No
20026	I will tell you this: I will not give any special treatment and I will strictly abide by the law.	No
28570	None of my proposals would affect hunters, athletes or people who use guns.	No
25051	We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	No
22915	It hurts the middle class.	No
3784	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	Yes
16322	and must do what he's talking about now.	No
27044	That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	No
10548	I have to correct Senator McCain's story a little, which is not surprising.	No
25285	That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	No
33983	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
20859	Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	No
10972	And if you do math, people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left and you add $5,000 that you're going to get like a refundable tax credit, do math, 95 percent of American people will have increased the funds to get out and buy insurance of their choice and make purchases and get -- all these people will be covered, except those who have these Cadillac gold-plated policies.	Yes
18807	It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	No
26616	We must therefore preserve the system.	No
13155	Perhaps we can obtain satisfactory assurances.	No
8927	So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	No
10950	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	No
30441	I support our democracy.	No
13168	We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	No
7992	And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.	No
16009	In Texas neighborhood politics and I've seen it at the national level.	No
24846	And we fired this man from Kuwait.	Yes
13504	We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	No
32692	And Iran kills ISIS.	Yes
30431	And I don't deserve that.	No
24139	But tell him it's not so dark; we are the United States, we have already faced difficult problems.	No
27599	And it was worth moving the sky and the earth to get it.	No
22567	I argued that we should fund it entirely.	No
14430	And the battlefield was searched, and there was not a single iota of evidence that American weapons were on that battlefield.	Yes
23154	This would ruin the quality of health care in America.	No
12202	This contrasts sharply, moreover, with a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans outside of tax relief.	Yes
2092	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	Yes
24981	But I also recognize that as two great superpowers in the world, we must live with each other.	No
2115	The federal government has not told everyone what kind of training programs they should have and what kind of Medicaid they should have.	No
20536	Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.	No
2013	It doesn't matter.	No
28403	And I want to come back to something I said before.	No
11522	I would, of course, and I suppose this administration would, too.	No
24505	And he went out and he did it.	No
393	But it will also require choices.	No
29056	I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	No
3213	And I can assure you that this administration will follow this high moral principle in our future foreign policy efforts, including our efforts in the Middle East, where it is of vital importance because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	No
2801	We tried to buy the success of our enemies, and at the same time we excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	No
29517	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	No
24900	I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.	No
16809	Mr. Ford vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - a year.	Yes
10841	And we're going to reinvigorate our economy.	No
16952	As a result over the past two years, we have had a responsible monetary policy.	No
12632	In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	No
20635	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	No
12984	America is not standing still.	No
34329	We've become very, very sloppy.	No
32847	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	No
11820	That's just not true, and that's not what America is doing.	No
24054	But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	Yes
13321	Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	No
17028	It was a superb occasion.	No
46	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
14538	Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.	No
12667	We want to be stronger.	No
891	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	No
24864	Thank you very much.	No
19049	And we will continue to spread freedom.	No
23186	Yeah, thanks for that.	No
11092	And maybe I have to make these difficult decisions.	No
24455	Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.	Yes
20486	I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.	No
4217	It had everything to do with energy.	No
33198	You mentioned the Heller decision.	No
19092	I wanted to turn this country into a programme of opportunities for all, of responsibilities for all and of an American community where everyone has a role to play.	No
15811	I'm thinking of Dr. Fauci.	No
19590	When I sent the fleet to Taiwan Strait.	No
16723	Such procedures, as well as evacuation procedures and adequate assurance, should be put in place.	No
29155	He's gonna be a jobmaker like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	No
27173	Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	No
24447	America has many families with problems today.	No
12798	If we fail, it was a great failure for everyone - for the human race.	No
19829	I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	No
29058	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	No
6635	This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	Yes
14231	There's nothing we can do.	No
20954	I throw my lot with people even when it means you have to defend some powerful interests that are trying to transform the - policies and laws to their advantage.	No
25033	There are now more than 2,000 more warheads reported to us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	Yes
560	Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.	No
17776	But this is outrageous because, for the political advantage, every time they do, they scare millions of older people who are totally dependent on social security, have no other place to turn.	No
28849	Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?	No
27209	And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	No
15093	I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.	Yes
16336	And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.	No
7665	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	No
28141	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	No
24634	So I'd really focus on getting these things out.	No
16609	We have 20 different agencies within the federal government responsible for production, regulation, energy information, energy conservation across government.	Yes
21126	And you know what, the problem is changing.	No
12882	And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	No
629	But you must have a little experience to know where to start.	No
29827	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	No
33357	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	No
28263	I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	No
26458	I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	No
9184	And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.	No
13668	But look what happened to the middle class.	No
15629	I think I'm a pretty nice guy.	No
31994	But these are things people say.	No
21013	And instead of focusing on tax cuts primarily for the rich, we want -- I want tax cuts for middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure it enriches not only a few, but all our families.	No
22163	We cannot have other cases like what happened when Mr Bush went to Japan and the Japanese Prime Minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	Yes
14953	The Office estimates that there are probably tens of billions of dollars lost in fraud alone, and they added that waste adds even more to that.	Yes
6595	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
21971	I see people in my condition, middle-class people -- their taxes increased in Washington and their services dropped while the rich got tax cuts.	Yes
960	We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.	No
17405	Yes, I feel as strong as anyone else about preserving the environment.	No
23524	And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	No
16916	Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.	Yes
12730	I have been a member of the Senate Committee on External Relations; I rise to the Chair with the full knowledge that his great responsibility, which is truly entrusted to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	No
18237	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	No
33415	But what she's not saying is that President Obama has expelled millions and millions of people like that.	Yes
19786	I believe that this election should be forward-looking.	No
16013	And I'm not going to go there and suggest changes in social security.	No
26662	I visited a Jeep factory, the oldest in America, a factory in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 Jeeps to the right this year, and they have 700 new jobs because of that.	Yes
561	It's not the length of your resume.	No
23867	We are living in a new world after the cold war, and what works in this new world is not a trap, not a government for the benefit of a few privileged people, not taxes and spending, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and education, to control the costs of American health care, and to bring the Americans together.	No
23751	We are not doing that today.	No
2021	And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	No
22863	Let me talk about North Korea.	No
21852	It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.	No
16947	I would not want to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve Board of Directors.	No
148	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	No
26093	Reduce the capital gains rate.	No
26978	They're not right.	No
27505	I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	No
7693	I do not believe that this administration has implemented the bills that represent the will of the majority of Congress twice with vigour.	Yes
17978	All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	No
365	And I think the housing community is ready.	No
21049	I'm not going to be the kind of president who says you're getting tax relief and you're not.	No
25145	- Me, or your own eyes?	No
1608	And we have not set an example for our own people.	No
16639	And in the term I was president - about two years - we cut federal employment by 11 thousand.	Yes
14480	The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	No
20333	We're gonna need someone who can work through partisan division.	No
32679	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	Yes
29913	I mean, you know -- now everyone in the general public will say, oh, that's not true.	No
27394	Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	No
26385	The Bureau of Labour Statistics said today that they had made a mistake.	Yes
31982	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	No
28944	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	Yes
13225	Maybe they're not my style.	No
26254	Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	No
10150	But telling our children that before they have babies, they should think about marrying someone, that's a good idea.	No
7758	So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	No
3374	We will never have this global leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to basic principles.	No
23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things happened.	No
20202	I questioned his proposals.	No
3551	I don't know if it was a criminal problem or a paternal problem, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	Yes
2724	And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.	No
19098	We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	Yes
19184	We have the highest foreign debt in history.	Yes
12541	Why did the President think it was wrong and why was the President right and are his criticisms wrong?	No
19433	And we have a responsibility.	No
20170	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighbourhoods, than anywhere I know.	No
23229	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	No
15114	And that is, we had the proper warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or withdraw our staff before the kidnapping and takeover took place.	Yes
26804	We all agreed that this would be a rather boring place.	No
3484	So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	No
26012	I proposed a budget that would take ten years for the life of the Health Insurance Trust Fund.	No
7812	We must stand for our ideals.	No
29822	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	No
19413	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	Yes
24981	But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.	No
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who was the Secretary of the Treasury, took great credit about a year ago and asked for and received substantial additional funds from Congress to hire internal revenue officers to pick up these funds, and I am pleased to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
18661	Saddam Hussein would have continued to weaken.	No
24207	Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.	No
18188	That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	No
22187	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	No
20819	We can make a huge difference by saying that if you receive federal money, we expect you to show results.	No
1399	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	No
13661	In addition, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has been in the last 20 years and it has asked Congress to spend more money than it has actually spent.	Yes
19962	The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	No
25298	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	No
31944	And the question for us, the question that our country must answer is that this is not what we are.	No
18026	That's why they fight so vocally.	No
2141	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	No
27354	We spend more on our army than the following 10 countries together: China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you call it.	Yes
16362	I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	No
22268	Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	No
18317	And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.	No
13880	I said once, in a frivolous moment, when it came out of the race: If you can't withstand the heat, buy a air conditioning company.	No
27042	But number five, the other thing we have to do is recognize that we cannot continue to build a nation in these areas.	No
27985	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	No
28364	And he should be proud of it, it's part of his file.	No
10729	"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""	No
12751	Thirdly, I would say this in relation to this report, with regard to the Gallup surveys of prestige abroad and everything we have heard about 'what about American prestige abroad': America's prestige abroad will be just as high as America's spokespersons allow.	No
25259	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	No
25885	But the last thing we should do is make sacrifices for those wearing uniforms.	No
3149	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	No
22650	I believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	No
20229	I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.	No
8967	In other words, I saw its program cost more than $300 million a year, only for the military.	Yes
19834	Let me say first of all that I am for students with more choice.	No
17184	It is the most difficult work on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that the things that must be done be done.	No
9593	And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.	No
28226	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	No
7504	We can have health care for all Americans.	No
7833	We must therefore use all these weapons to combat the recession if it were to come.	No
22612	In the old days, we would see a threat, and we could face it if we wanted it or not.	No
21664	Textiles, shoes, things like that we say are yesterday's industries.	No
26004	Social security is stable until, as you have pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	Yes
6280	There is no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	No
12043	But I'm not to do anything that would affect hunters or athletes, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	No
3668	Look, it's just not true.	No
14681	It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	No
24292	When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	No
25642	We have met young America.	No
20592	And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	No
22052	I understand the importance of time, but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	No
28461	We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	No
19664	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	No
16139	Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	No
13466	With regard to exhaustion allowances, I would like to point out that this is an oil depletion allowance that provides eighty per cent of all those involved in exhaustion, so that you will not get a lot of income with respect to exhaustion allowances, unless you move to the area that it has indicated.	Yes
18787	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	No
22773	And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	No
11566	When I was in the Senate before I became Vice-President, I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	Yes
5897	It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	No
4047	I know what our needs are.	No
26351	This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	No
14245	I think that's where we started.	No
22434	If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.	No
7645	And I never intend to express my regret to Mr Khrushchev or anyone else if I do something that is in Congress' support and that is just to protect the security of the United States.	No
18269	Almost every step of the way, our troops were left on these extremely difficult missions.	No
12582	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	Yes
12710	We will have to try to establish closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we want to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout Latin America.	No
27097	We are taking the lead.	No
33077	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	No
34041	She shouldn't have the right to flee.	No
9809	He didn't do that either.	No
16	I think we've seen a deterioration of values.	No
6208	And that's the kind of judge that I want.	No
14767	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	No
33867	And frankly, these stories have been largely untangled.	Yes
13713	We are the second lowest tax burden in the country, the second lowest tax burden in the country.	Yes
12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of 50 states in health care -- among children with health care.	Yes
23335	It is not credible to say that it will cut taxes and balance budgets.	No
8441	The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	No
20595	Like the vice president is.	No
20982	I would ensure that the main members of Congress are called upon to discuss the seriousness of the situation.	No
13598	I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	Yes
13261	Why did they reject him?	No
2996	When this republican administration took office, we were sending about $1 billion in weapons abroad, now ten to twelve billion dollars in weapons abroad to countries that often use these weapons to fight.	Yes
24842	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	Yes
20561	A governor appoints judges of the Supreme Court.	No
29795	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a weapon.	No
19559	And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	No
13515	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is more important than ours.	Yes
8665	I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	Yes
19211	How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	No
13511	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	No
22001	So at least we have time to work with it.	No
24792	We just have a bad system.	No
14314	And we have very good Republicans running.	Yes
34243	But he fell from -- from any point of view.	No
33911	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	No
25123	But we have succeeded to the point that the Government of Lebanon has been organized - if you remember, there have been meetings in Geneva where they began to meet with hostile factional forces and to try to set up a kind of peace plan.	Yes
24696	The Chair has another proposal to ask them to pay an additional $400 per year for the next 5 years.	Yes
2720	The question now is how we build on these forces.	No
22694	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	No
9653	Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	No
20265	And he has a lot of experience, but so do I.	No
16821	Now, we have such an unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a shame - ah of all taxes - benefits now, 25 percent of them go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
16738	And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.	No
13658	And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	Yes
22590	He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a serious threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	Yes
23696	I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	No
24664	Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	No
15295	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	No
14289	I happen to think she's a key person.	No
28935	I think it is a deterrent.	No
7683	And I can assure you that if I'm elected president, we will.	No
8525	We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	No
16331	Because I think you see, I'm one of the people I get when I'm a little old-fashioned about these things, but I believe in the public service.	No
2991	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	No
967	With decent and affordable health care for all working families.	No
18204	And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	No
7598	No, Cuba is not lost, and I do not think that this kind of defeatist speech by Senator Kennedy is a little helpful.	No
8428	I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	No
24239	I think the American people are ready for action.	No
17191	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	No
20011	Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	No
11880	We can do better in our public schools.	No
1261	Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	No
2364	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	No
3210	He did a great job of getting South Africa's Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come to find a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	Yes
23830	But before I can do it, I have to challenge the Americans to change, and they have to decide.	No
26396	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	No
17275	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	No
22422	I believe that we must control compulsory expenditure.	No
7042	And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	Yes
6167	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	No
8788	So, yes, I told the American National Legion!	No
29462	We've reviewed your tax proposals.	No
11772	It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	No
22928	Let me respond to what he has just said, about the whole world.	No
24864	Thank you very, very much.	No
18332	They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	Yes
19658	And even when it was almost adopted, Senator Kennedy retained it for 100 days, because he was not satisfied with a provision.	Yes
8883	John claims he's understanding where the money will come from.	No
27929	Ann was with someone the other day crying about not being able to work.	No
12115	I think that's the best way to do it.	No
26208	Because you have a big tax increase.	Yes
15047	But, as governor, when I was in that position and received some of these government program grants, I saw that many of them were out of order.	No
17630	I gave you some time.	No
6137	Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	No
12807	If we fail, then we have to shoulder our responsibilities to ourselves.	No
16836	They put $30,000 in their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	Yes
24643	But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	No
17786	Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	No
77	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	Yes
17617	And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in California's history and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what do you intend to do?	Yes
22747	Yes, we must succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	No
3371	We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	No
28865	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	No
17505	And it's not that simple, either.	No
22431	Thank you very much.	No
34080	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	No
29431	They're going to expand their companies.	No
22724	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	Yes
8003	So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.	No
20357	Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	No
24135	With interest rates down and inflation down, the most cruel tax of all, taken in a global slowdown right now, that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and help with job retraining and education.	Yes
6974	This will be a vital issue for my second term.	No
29535	We have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of.	No
13719	I grew up five blocks from Arkansas.	No
909	But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	Yes
20	We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	No
27972	We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	No
14475	Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	Yes
3961	Don't do that.	No
25421	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	No
1061	I regret the things of my long campaign that have been wrong, but I'm trying to put an end to the last ten days.	No
28904	Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	No
30083	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	No
32725	So we have ads coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will attack Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	Yes
31844	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	No
8849	What I advocated was, why not start with the federal government by referring tax sources to state and local governments, and the responsibilities of these programs?	No
21792	If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	No
20545	I appointed four Supreme Court judges in the state of Texas and asked people to check their qualifications, their deliberations.	No
15419	And I had to deal with these crises as best I could.	No
27196	These principles include human rights, human dignity, freedom of enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	Yes
20755	He says he's gonna make you tax reductions.	No
22394	How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	No
25529	We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	No
14411	Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	No
2996	When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	Yes
26781	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	No
22298	He does what GI Bill himself did when I came out of World War II.	No
13260	Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	Yes
24269	We have a 4% gap between what we pay for treasures, and what Germany pays for one to five years of treasures.	Yes
17980	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and I say that our prayers are with the good people of this state, who have suffered a lot.	No
17644	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in previous years before our arrival.	Yes
11708	It would be a repeal of our agreement with NATO.	Yes
10144	And I believe that if we do a better job in education, we -- we will give people the hope and opportunity they deserve and maybe less violence from that.	No
9177	Number two, we need to make sure we have the best education system in the world.	No
16531	We will have an integrated security version with a complete reorganization of the executive of the government that I have committed to do.	No
23352	That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	Yes
8181	We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	Yes
26642	We took it out of politics.	No
11237	But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.	No
23613	It helped me go through a war, it led me today.	No
24498	Many of the countries below that said, well, that this is the problem of the United States -- if you get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- work together with the DEA and the army.	Yes
26818	But beyond that we need to address the economy.	No
17007	Our economic strength is still there.	No
11486	I believe that credibility will be very important in the future in the Middle East.	No
10569	But we will have to have some Washington leadership that not only sets better regulations for the financial system.	No
27044	This will help us maintain the kind of American leadership we need.	No
15268	And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	No
16589	And we cut off these three hundred agencies and so on and so on.	Yes
12124	So, I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	No
6401	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	No
8045	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	No
119	He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.	Yes
30210	After 11 September, when the 28 NATO nations said they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something they continue to do with us.	Yes
4191	They must withdraw from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	No
23620	And I have to make that judgment.	No
26779	It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	No
17206	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	No
18404	What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	No
27246	The president said that we would now be an unemployment of 5.4 per cent.	Yes
8726	We have a supply of coal equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	Yes
15308	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep social security healthy, it must be maintained in this way.	No
180	I want to continue this economic recovery.	No
18956	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	No
21016	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	Yes
26989	I have clear eyes on this.	No
3955	So we can't ignore these lessons from history.	No
27646	We then started to build up Afghan forces.	No
3616	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pig bar expenses.	Yes
21183	I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	No
10916	Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
14264	And I just had to work that in.	No
1603	We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.	No
24502	But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	No
22117	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	No
21031	The Senate Budget Committee conducted a study of the Vice-Chair's expenses.	Yes
8129	I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	Yes
13429	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	No
26286	If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	Yes
13654	I disagree with both of them.	No
6170	And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	No
6905	Here's what I do: We take care of Medicaid children from states so that every child in America is covered.	No
16825	A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	Yes
24999	And I told them it wasn't.	No
3968	It is run by a handful of tribes.	No
1362	And when you go through the registration process, you, in fact, penalize that person who uses his weapon for very legitimate purposes.	No
27375	I was lucky enough to be governor of a state.	No
32891	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	No
23894	So, if it's time to act, I think I have experience that matters.	No
18030	And if we lose our will, we lose.	No
15423	I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	No
16516	If we assume a rate of growth in our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the Vietnam War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can reduce our unemployment rate to 4 to 4 and a half per cent - under these circumstances, even assuming that there is no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in advertising - in the allocation of funds to fund programs, by increasing like the rate of inflation - my economic projections, I think, confirmed by the House - and the Senate committees, have been with the additional $60 billion that can be spent in fiscal year 81, which will be the last year of this next term.	Yes
14938	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and reducing the cost of government where we have balanced budgets, and not crush the press money to print, flooding the market with it because the government spends more than it takes.	No
12615	By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubans in Latin America?	No
20723	Why haven't they done it in seven years?	No
29832	But stop-and-frisk has had a huge impact on the security of New York City.	Yes
21619	That's the problem with our system.	No
1006	I believe that the American people will be called on to be at the forefront by giving direction to the solution of these problems that need to be solved in the Middle East, in Southern Africa, and all the problems that may arise in the Pacific.	No
15665	Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.	No
8393	And I believe that by increasing the burden of property tax, which is already imposed in many of our communities, we will, in my view, ensure that many of our children will not be adequately educated and that many of our teachers will not be adequately compensated.	No
15970	In other states, we've done it.	Yes
11561	Now there's more work to do.	No
3230	This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	Yes
7112	He doesn't understand how borders work, obviously, to say that.	No
20496	I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	No
29201	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	Yes
15871	They're not left or right.	No
25009	I am not going to make the decision about the tactics that could be ours, but there are obviously a number of areas in the world that are important to us.	No
1581	And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	Yes
31962	We saw her first hand when she was a senator from the United States.	Yes
27990	I know what it takes to get this country back, and I will work with the good Democrats and the good Republicans to do it.	No
15776	And I'm proud to have been part of an administration that did exactly that.	No
362	We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	No
27557	That is why, as President, we have funded an Iron Dome programme to stop these missiles.	Yes
23326	He's been here for 20 years.	No
24677	So I'm looking forward to this challenge, and just looking...	No
28758	Tell me what I heard.	No
22928	Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	No
5708	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	No
18012	We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	No
28886	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	No
795	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	No
1894	We have created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
7210	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
2190	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	Yes
25204	Mr. Mondale, I'm gonna hang in there.	No
29122	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	No
13127	I support him and the island of Pescadores.	No
33013	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	No
8864	And if we had a homestead number, and we were telling people, for $1, we were selling you this house.	No
19224	But among the people listening tonight, the families who will benefit from economic packages, they will be better when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp will be vice president.	No
23584	No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	No
7419	We need to change that.	No
18929	I'll tell you another way to protect America in the long term is to continue with missile defences.	No
17593	Yeah, but he paid 10 times more.	Yes
8399	In any event, I think that we can finance essential programmes in a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	No
14887	Again, it is important to put the situation in perspective.	No
7439	Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	No
9625	But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	No
8211	Now, this is not standing still.	No
427	That is one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate in any industrial state in the country.	Yes
1305	And it's been eight years since it's been missing.	No
375	Mr. Bush talked about values.	No
12122	I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.	Yes
28235	Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	No
33412	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	Yes
1099	I don't have a response.	No
33371	We will do much better with Mexico with regard to trade agreements.	No
13174	He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	Yes
8197	We have developed more hydroelectric power over these seven and a half years than in any previous administration of history.	Yes
20174	And if you really want to get involved, tap my homepage, www.DoleKemp96.org.	No
2947	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	No
11688	And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	Yes
19992	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign on the stakes.	No
18395	And as I told you, there will be a summit of Arab nations.	No
25197	"We said, ""Okay, if that's what you want to do."""	No
13190	We have experienced this tragic experience that led to the Second World War.	No
965	I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	No
27966	Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	No
11401	Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.	No
7094	And the salary to take away from the richest.	No
1259	And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.	No
12222	The horse is up here now.	No
18552	Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	No
27892	They'd have been through a...	No
1978	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
12127	That's one of my priorities.	No
17087	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	No
17128	This means that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	No
7072	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	No
20063	I'm trying to save your Medicare, just like I saved social security with a bipartite commission.	Yes
14725	On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	No
33915	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	Yes
23248	And most of this tax reduction was granted to the richest people in the country.	Yes
169	What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.	Yes
4039	You don't interfere with terror on the central front and you don't interfere with it after Ben Laden.	No
22712	He came to see me.	No
907	Well, I think we have to go and work on the Third World debt problem and we have to help these Third World countries to cope with the massive debt they have currently contracted and which, if we do nothing and do not help them with other nations in the world, we will destroy their economies and destroy their future.	No
15757	I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	No
26283	There are 168 federal programs that allow for quotas.	Yes
22887	It works when you make sure they have housing, as we did in the last military budgets.	Yes
3589	I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.	No
31846	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	No
12704	They must include other Latin American countries.	No
7707	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the declaration of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we are not to be accused of hypocrisy in front of the world, we must respect those standards.	No
17522	We'd have to get better when we recognize that we're talking about a life.	No
19032	And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	No
20677	The other day, I was honoured to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf, who recently stood by me and accepted with me.	No
3152	Last May, in a speech to the United Nations, I pleaded that we should act immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, weapons and peaceful devices; that we should no longer ship atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls on waste that can be converted into explosives.	Yes
1070	We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	No
6357	But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	Yes
7746	Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.	Yes
22421	I'm not gonna do that.	No
23055	You know what he said?	No
2569	First of all, I love great schools.	No
17747	What we need, however, is not only that, but that we should move forward, not only to congratulate ourselves, but also to commit ourselves to solving America's problems.	No
27500	And I made it very clear to them.	No
22914	These are families that get hurt.	No
27085	We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	No
16503	In January 1975, he requested a tax change: an increase of $5.6 billion for low- and middle-income individuals, a decrease of $6.5 billion for corporations and special interest.	Yes
11658	I understand, and Africa is important.	No
17748	I'm thinking about education, when he lectured the country on the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little.	No
28742	And I know they say it's nowhere in the polls.	No
14610	So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	No
26114	We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	Yes
24332	There is no doubt about that.	No
523	If we invest in vocational training, in childcare for these young people, in long-term health benefits so that the mother and her children do not lose their health benefits when they go to work, we can literally help hundreds of thousands, even millions of families, to get out of social assistance, to become independent and self-reliant, to be taxpayers citizens and to improve their lives, quality of life, their future and the future of these children.	No
19720	Sometimes the United States must act alone or at least act first.	No
27759	It's not my mandate, it's the President's Secretary of Defense who called those trillion dollars of cuts to our devastating military.	Yes
1814	I know you and your racing companion keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's not.	No
29697	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	No
11530	I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	No
29729	And in many cases, they are here illegally, illegal immigrants.	Yes
28740	Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	No
23696	I made mistakes by naming people, but I'm not going to name them.	No
15723	Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.	No
704	An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.	Yes
30212	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	Yes
386	I've talked to bankers, builders and developers, housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want Washington's leadership.	No
26932	But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	No
4116	There is a difference between preconditions and preparation.	No
19537	So we need more protection against America.	No
7953	I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	No
28464	What can I bring to this challenge?	No
474	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	No
19058	By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.	No
25352	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	No
4169	We'll take a look.	No
15606	And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	Yes
31874	At the same time, we must take care of people on all sides.	No
11822	One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	No
6526	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, do not get a flu vaccine.	No
13483	I think we were right to wear it.	No
1515	That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	No
462	And it continues to evolve, and it evolves in favor of life.	No
381	We went out and built housing.	No
1538	I think most people know that I did not ask for the presidency.	No
16691	We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	Yes
620	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	No
21973	When a factory closes, I know the people who run it.	No
3639	What he is not telling you is that he intends, for the first time in history, to impose health benefits.	Yes
25966	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	No
21308	To those of you in the public who are business people: quite simple.	No
26538	We need to deal with managed care.	No
3635	It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	No
34339	But that being said, we are going to create an economic machine like the one we haven't seen in many decades.	No
149	And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	No
5500	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	Yes
15451	Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	No
18562	And I think that an essential component of success in Iraq is to be able to convince Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States has no long-term visions.	No
14657	I also have a philosophical difference.	No
185	And in the sense that there are Medicaid provisions that will be very useful for the kind of people we are talking about here.	No
27476	Well, first of all, they're reports in the paper.	No
3938	We have had the greatest number of deaths among American troops in the past year than at any time since 2002.	Yes
11415	I have given a lot of thought to this particular issue, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we are defending in the world.	No
28252	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	Yes
31920	We're going to make America safe again.	No
18602	He has more of the same.	No
22024	On the general question here, when you try to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	No
11478	And we just have to take it day by day.	No
3807	And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.	No
1519	We have reduced the military strength by one million four hundred thousand.	Yes
22141	Germany and Japan spend about $30 billion per coin.	Yes
20778	There's a difference of opinion.	No
1428	In fact, on the basis of this week's announcement, there will be an annual rate of one million, eight hundred and a thousand new houses built, which represents a considerable increase over last year and a substantial increase over the first half of this year.	Yes
29176	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help rich people, the better we will be and that everything will be arranged from there.	Yes
14388	So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	No
11249	We need to be much more strategic if we are to be able to meet all the challenges we face.	No
3926	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	Yes
21976	What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	No
28721	And if they don't, we're going to ask for a stronger authority in the hands of the FTC on false and misleading advertising.	No
21107	But even before, the problem is because the money paid to social security this year is a right.	No
8424	We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	No
26176	This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	Yes
26836	Could have a chance to serve as president.	No
15096	And I think anyone looking for this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought about themselves, and about it, and about it?	No
20161	It's important, it's their future.	No
11419	It's true, even those who sometimes shake our fists.	No
21849	So I want to keep the quality of health care.	No
9323	How much did you cut them by, then?	No
33461	And you see, we're going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	No
21705	In the communities that really managed to put the police near the schools where the children carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you saw the crime fall.	Yes
2655	I do not want to reduce our commitment to education.	No
24969	I'm sure you like it.	No
15407	Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	No
18098	And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	No
30312	It is essential that America's word be good.	No
21319	And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	No
8492	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	No
31990	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	Yes
23430	Third, spread what is known as health savings accounts.	No
14273	Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	Yes
9866	I want our legal system to work better.	No
4130	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	Yes
16254	I think a lot of them went out today.	No
24812	They fought and won World War II.	No
19826	And I'm trying to do a lot of things that could be useful to people.	No
19419	I think we need to keep working on this until those who think it's not dangerous don't kill them and destroy their lives, get the message and don't change.	No
18009	Our nation has a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hatred.	No
27102	When we entered Libya, we were able to put an immediate end to it, because of the unique circumstances and coalition that we had helped to organize.	Yes
12164	And they get health care.	Yes
1914	My plan is to reduce rates, but also reduce deductions, exemptions and credits at the same time so that revenues stay in, but we cut rates to get more people who work.	No
4257	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	No
1968	When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	Yes
21098	Mr. Greenspan, I thought I missed an opportunity to say that there's a third way, and it's to get a better rate of return from Social Security funds entering the trust.	No
21179	People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.	No
22675	And, Mr President, yesterday, the Duelfer report told you and the whole world that they had worked.	Yes
8975	The truth is, we've halved the increase in spending.	Yes
20040	And Senator Kennedy is also a friend of yours.	No
21403	I was in Texas to take care of business, take care of my family.	No
23326	It's been there for 20 years.	No
29375	It will create a huge number of new jobs.	No
27538	We are four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
25590	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	No
25363	But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.	No
30227	It's not the right temperament to be commander-in-chief, to be bullied.	No
32654	Now, with that being said, she speaks hard against Russia.	No
29223	I could name them, I mean, there are thousands of them.	Yes
29303	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	Yes
29778	We don't want him back.	No
5623	Programs that we need, we should make them work better.	No
11035	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	No
29665	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my businesses.	No
21873	You're supposed to have a government coming from you.	No
26028	I think if I were an elderly person, I'd get a little tired of all those ads that scare seniors, scare veterans, and scare students about education.	No
3909	This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	No
26357	I work every day with people.	No
27560	And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	No
7675	These are the main questions: equality of education at school.	No
6320	Because they wanted to have the same choice as you, me, Cindy and your wife.	No
15258	It is an inaccuracy, of course, of my position.	No
10628	The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	No
7195	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at the city of New York and you see that 50 percent of black men out there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	Yes
33955	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	No
15245	Nuclear energy: 36 plants were planned in that country.	Yes
19453	It's called the automated check or the instant check.	No
8843	I don't think I should go against that promise.	No
23872	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	No
32401	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	No
19605	We don't know what's going to happen.	No
1887	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	No
17654	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	No
24760	Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	No
17896	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	No
24835	You have to make some hard calls.	No
17863	As far as business investment is concerned, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	Yes
21657	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we're sitting here in the jam because it's a campaign year.	No
635	But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.	No
2872	After firing James Schlesinger, the political heat became so great that he added about $3 billion.	Yes
14896	The most recent figures, the last three months, in the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it shows very clearly that in addition to providing a huge number of jobs - nine million new jobs over the last three and a half years - the inflation threat is still urgent for us.	Yes
5951	In Iraq, he had the idea of dividing Iraq into three countries.	Yes
3031	It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	No
29817	And when people are there, even if they shouldn't be there, we'll help them, we'll legally help them, we'll help them get down.	No
26904	And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	No
27261	We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	No
856	I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	No
20060	It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	No
32480	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	Yes
19025	I think we can succeed.	No
3256	Again, the Panamanian question is a confused question by Mr Ford.	No
15625	Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	Yes
25808	Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	No
26589	And people have to decide.	No
9044	We were talking a multitude of languages.	No
26387	So we're talking about all these new jobs.	No
20499	Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	No
8849	What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?	No
25156	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	Yes
26774	But we're not there yet.	No
34302	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	Yes
1760	But so that we do not lose revenue, that the government is running out of money, that I also reduce deductions, credits, and exemptions, so that we continue to take the same money when you also count for growth.	Yes
34318	But we are increasing it from 1% to 4%.	Yes
20736	I think we need to balance the budget every year, repay the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal, the national debt will be completely eliminated by 2012.	No
22161	We must continue until all these nuclear weapons in Russia are left and the other republics.	No
19334	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	No
6734	And that's to be honored.	No
19144	I supported chip V so that parents could control what their children watch on television when they are young, as well as rating systems for educational television and television.	Yes
25774	You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.	No
16232	I set out my position.	No
12406	And we need to do something about it.	No
9394	That's not an energy strategy for the future.	No
9822	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	Yes
7150	Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	No
3240	Karl Marx was the grandfather of communism.	No
30244	It well describes the problem.	No
7285	Neighbourhoods are safer when you punish people who commit crimes with weapons.	No
19733	I want to be very serious.	No
33858	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	No
12995	He's been in some other country.	No
2459	But the fact is that some of the prescriptions he has proposed, like letting you buy insurance beyond the lines of the state, there is no indication that in one way or another will help someone who has a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	No
32774	I'd go after Baghdadi.	No
15703	They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	No
11071	We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	No
9001	But I believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to speak, or even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	No
24956	I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	No
23867	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	No
15151	Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	Yes
8946	And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I can tell, there are 88 proposals that call for additional government spending programs.	Yes
21847	He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	Yes
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
14475	Now, if you think you and the Washington Post are thinking of this in-depth study that was done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year, they're gonna hit us with a hundred banks, it's gonna be a $100 billion problem.	Yes
17804	And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	No
13982	This is my point tonight.	No
23610	I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.	No
1081	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	Yes
14849	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	No
26903	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	No
23117	Five million people lost their health insurance under this president.	Yes
13170	Yes, we should make a great effort.	No
23727	Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	No
33730	And they checked the facts, and they said I was right.	Yes
20027	And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	No
27512	I think they noticed that as well.	No
2065	I think most Americans would say it doesn't make sense.	No
16715	We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	No
24457	So, with the whole discussion of family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them.	No
16461	In particular, I note that he did not support the Humphrey-Hawkins bill that he sometimes has and that is part of the democratic platform.	Yes
21699	I also think that we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose sole purpose is to kill.	No
6788	My faith affects everything I do, indeed.	No
13000	We can't bear the reason we're in a race, as I said.	No
18770	Moreover, the breach of the agreement was not plutonium.	No
17321	Jerry Falwell says it means we have two or three judges.	No
14715	That's my commitment to you.	No
24357	Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	No
4328	We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.	No
28688	We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	No
21362	Now, I could get rid of it in four years in book theory now, but to do so, you'll have to raise taxes too much and reduce profits too much for people who need it and that would even make the economy worse.	No
8436	But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	No
19868	That is one of the main reasons why I vetoed him.	Yes
32046	I would never talk about what I want to do and how we will really improve people's lives.	No
7531	Over the next four years, we will continue to emphasize excellence in every class in America so that our children can have the chance to fulfill America's great promise.	No
6600	He proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and yet the so-called rich tax, which is also a tax on many small business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by its account.	Yes
9146	With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.	Yes
19398	And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.	No
30352	But you must have some basic ability.	No
9246	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	No
527	Think of that father over there in Houston who has to tell his young man that he can't play the little league that he can't get out on the ballground because he's afraid he'll get hurt.	No
16491	I am sure you know that in the resolutions adopted by Congress, which added about $17 billion in additional expenditure, by Congress on the budget that I recommended.	Yes
4001	That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	No
12394	And I will continue to defend my case and my proposals against what I think is exaggeration.	No
32343	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	No
30058	Because we have to defeat ISIS, and we have to do everything we can to disrupt their online propaganda efforts.	No
12523	I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.	No
26722	Let me very briefly give you some examples.	No
3919	What he said was a precipitous...	No
1717	I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.	No
14656	And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.	No
23352	That's why I proposed a hydrogen car -- a hydrogen car.	Yes
3045	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	Yes
14064	We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.	No
19976	So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	No
21840	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	Yes
32475	And she'll never change.	No
24818	I would like to thank the people of Saint Louis University and Washington, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	No
33669	When President Obama took office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	Yes
12088	We believe in hard love.	No
7787	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	No
22102	For me, a new world order means freedom and democracy.	No
22638	Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.	No
26384	We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	Yes
21406	But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	Yes
11543	I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	No
27853	It is not research, Mr President, it is the government that invests in business.	No
34170	I guess he thinks he looks better now to contrast with me because I voted in favour.	Yes
3049	And over the next four years, it will be the policies of this administration.	No
10864	And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.	No
21207	Look, Governor Bush, you attacked my character and credibility and I'm not going to respond in kind.	No
13630	I want to do something about that.	No
20010	Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	No
15004	I am eternally optimistic, and I believe that we have made great progress since I was young and when this country did not even know that it had a racial problem.	No
32803	She called it the gold standard.	Yes
33161	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	No
20935	That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	No
32863	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	No
21025	One, many people are still waiting for this 1992 middle-class tax reduction.	Yes
13451	And if there are inequalities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to fill that gap, I voted in the past to reduce the exhaustion allowance for the largest producers; for those of five million dollars in decline, to keep it twenty-seven and one-half per cent.	Yes
17242	And three days after the 1982 elections, they came to tell us that social security, as we know, is broken.	Yes
22026	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	No
20363	The federal government should not take more than one third of anyone's cheque.	No
15785	But there are a lot of people I admire in this country today.	No
7144	Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	Yes
3030	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated Iraqi government are neighbours to Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	No
7893	I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.	Yes
12566	And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	No
26582	Let me make another suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	No
7519	In the oval office, there's a painting by Laura's friend and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	No
17471	Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	No
26209	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	Yes
560	This is not the time you spend in Washington.	No
23019	And all I can tell you is that every day I know there are people doing overtime, doing their best.	No
22052	I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	No
26925	And that's what we've done over the last four years.	No
31864	We had a deficit of $800 billion.	Yes
3963	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	No
23244	Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	Yes
11929	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	No
13892	I never said -- and I challenge you to find where I said -- I gave a long speech on the environment in April, and I said that we should aim to raise energy efficiency standards to 40 miles per gallon.	Yes
652	Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	No
32461	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	No
32137	It's nice to -- one on three.	No
19182	Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	Yes
11725	That's what it's meant to do.	No
24130	If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of an unwise reduction in the level of the troops, you're going to put a lot more unemployed.	No
34018	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	No
2247	Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	No
19585	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	No
12966	Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	No
4188	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	No
22038	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	No
28197	The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	Yes
9418	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	No
20083	We just see the world in different ways.	No
18901	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for that.	No
16705	I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	Yes
12850	The Soviet Union understands force.	No
7793	I don't think we could afford not to do these things.	No
23826	I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.	No
7617	And I said that I thought that rather than saying the lie we said, rather than saying that the flights would continue - in fact, I think Mr.Nixon himself said on May 15th that the flights would continue even if Mr.Herter testified before the Senate Committee on External Relations that they had been cancelled on May 12th - that he would have been much better than if we had expressed regret, if it had saved the summit, and if the summit was useful - and I think that is the case.	Yes
13385	Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	No
18883	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	No
32804	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	Yes
19702	We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
27028	...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	No
12066	But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	No
27329	The good news is (inaudible).	No
14176	There was a good thing that came out of this budgetary agreement, that is, we have capped discretionary spending.	Yes
19845	I'd better correct the President.	No
29688	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	Yes
2128	You know, I suspect that, in the area of social security, we have a somewhat similar position.	No
29146	We probably don't agree on the figures and the amounts and what we're going to do, but maybe we'll talk about it later.	No
30056	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	Yes
29942	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	No
24208	It is the number one culprit.	No
3225	South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	No
11966	I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	No
11208	And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	Yes
29995	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	No
29496	And believe me, we're in a bubble right now.	No
8072	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	No
2912	We have seen in the past the destruction of elected governments, as in Chile, and the strong support of the military dictatorship there.	Yes
15150	It was blocked by a democratic majority Senate.	Yes
8674	The tax burden, I think, is necessary.	No
26191	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	Yes
7733	Mr. Morgan, no matter how good we are during the Cold War, we're not as good as we should be.	No
7503	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we lose abroad.	No
15200	And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.	No
6870	He has no records on health care reform.	Yes
8759	So I think we prove that we can move forward with conservation and take advantage of it.	No
1020	I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	Yes
1426	We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	Yes
25552	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	No
12614	What are freedom's chances in those areas?	No
16577	And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	No
12138	I thought that was exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	Yes
27512	I think they noticed that, too.	No
12563	But all this in itself is not enough.	No
23507	Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.	No
21018	Too many people have been left behind.	No
27904	People will check.	No
15187	Not only does he advocate the abolition of this treaty - and I do not know that these men he cites are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said, of being a missing element, of playing an asset against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and insists on the nuclear superiority of our own nation, as a predicative for future negotiations with the Soviet Union.	Yes
20550	And in my view, the Constitution must be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	No
17689	Now we need a tight budget, but there is no doubt that this administration has highlighted things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they are hurting.	No
27070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	No
23969	Second, we want to provide modest tax relief to the middle class to restore equity, especially to middle class people with incomes below $60,000.	No
17627	And maybe part of this problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country increased 87 percent.	Yes
34025	I'm not looking anymore.	No
15729	We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	No
13537	Its growth rate is not what counts, it is whether it catches up with us and if it does not catch up with us.	No
15936	And it is a question of whether the United States will continue to lead towards peace.	No
15016	When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	No
34037	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your lists of electors, you'll see millions of people registered to vote -- millions, it's not from me -- it's from the Pew report and other places -- millions of people registered to vote who shouldn't be registered to vote.	Yes
16393	Because I think so when I say I want a nicer and sweeter nation.	No
10961	As you notice, he starts talking about government.	No
18982	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march, not in Russia right now."""	No
18078	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	No
17185	I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	No
24335	I mean, it's done.	Yes
18215	And the test isn't if you spend more money.	No
28639	Every day is the day of the earth if you possess the earth.	No
1049	I believe that the main reason for a decline in participation since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people with regard to the performance of public servants.	Yes
11685	This idea of nation-building is a kind of pejorative phrase, but think of the great conflict of the last century, the Second World War.	No
2617	But -- but what he did is -- if you extrapolate how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20%.	Yes
13410	He's been traveling in some other country.	No
822	He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	Yes
14672	I am focusing on the fact that we may have bank bankruptcies and no one has responded.	No
28194	There must be more community health clinics where the poor can seek health care.	No
23167	What means something is: Do you have a plan?	No
1922	Moving forward with the status quo is not going to cut it off for the American people who are struggling today.	No
24676	And they will make those sacrifices.	No
14949	most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	No
7593	If I had made such a statement, it was in direct opposition to this treaty.	No
29783	We must therefore address systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	No
844	And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.	No
23646	The culture of life is really important to a country if it has to be a hospital society.	No
17577	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	No
4100	Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	Yes
26129	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	Yes
11300	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	No
12637	I saw Cuba go to the Communists.	No
14619	You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	No
28697	And so I don't support censorship.	No
27065	And I'm sure Assad's days are numbered.	No
17013	And I think we can bind our wounds.	No
11193	"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""	No
29486	I think I'm building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making the university debt-free so that more young people can get their education, help people refinance their -- their university debt at a lower rate.	No
13275	Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	No
23380	I'm going to be a president who believes in science.	No
10857	The bad news is we lost.	No
13798	The only thing I would like to say about this is, I think, that on the economy, Mr Bush said for a long time that there was no recession, and then he said that it would be better not to do anything but to have a compromise effort with Congress.	Yes
25192	You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.	No
11809	I remember the first time the stories came out about the stops in New Jersey by the road patrol over there.	No
8351	All his advisors do is give advice when he asks.	No
28537	I don't think the National Association of Rifle held this announcement.	No
34419	I have a plan to do this.	No
8173	The things Senator Kennedy has said to many of us can agree.	No
24627	And we're all in this fight together, we all care about it.	No
17847	Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	No
33057	You know, because it looks like you're in the company or you're aware of people in the company -- you know we're now, for the first time, energy dependent.	Yes
8215	And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	No
12446	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	No
16984	There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	No
15095	And I said, well, yes.	No
16270	And every defence expert I know, including the people of the Pentagon himself, will tell you that given the level of defence spending and the level of defence funding that Congress has now approved and that the President has signed, there is no way that you can do all these things and do them right.	No
13619	It is the private sector that creates jobs.	Yes
27995	I'm sure we'll do it.	No
10818	We need to sit in front of the table.	No
16088	But let me just say, for the record, that I did not vote to cut the COLA.	Yes
7123	We could speed it up.	No
5945	This is an example, I think, of the kind of use of scalpel that we want to make sure we fund some of these programs.	No
4253	And that means, yes, an increase in domestic production and offshore drilling, but we have only 3 per cent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 per cent of the world's oil.	Yes
26255	We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	No
19567	Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	No
6119	And that's your plan, John.	No
634	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	No
21306	And they will be blocked at that time because, for example, we have international competitors who simply couldn't unload their cars from ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a two-way street, just couldn't do it.	No
29051	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	No
22821	The job of a president is to win peace.	No
4085	They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	Yes
26533	I think that would help.	No
28537	I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.	No
8177	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	No
5918	The Americans got to know Sarah Palin.	No
18013	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	No
8245	I know what it means to be poor.	No
16892	They spend too much money on themselves.	No
23646	Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	No
28593	But that's the good news.	No
15353	Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	No
26283	There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	Yes
21698	Once you automate your files, then you don't need to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	No
8493	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to move his program - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	No
7672	He was the head of the Public Procurement Committee, which conducted two cases, both in the Columbia District.	No
26656	And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	Yes
20083	We see the world in different ways.	No
16794	In fact, Mr. Ford has fewer people in the private sector who work in non-agricultural jobs than when he took up his duties.	Yes
2812	I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.	No
19635	When he fought against a regulatory reform that cost the family an average of $6 to $7,000 a year.	Yes
20222	Well, we do come from different places.	No
11202	We must double the size of the Afghan army.	No
19292	We worked too hard to lower it.	No
19144	I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.	Yes
6077	We need to have more community health centers.	No
23342	"I have proposed to the United States Congress a ""Clear Sky"" initiative to reduce sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70%."	Yes
21495	Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	No
28750	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	Yes
33992	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	Yes
27505	I think that from the beginning, one of the challenges we have had with Iran is that they have examined this administration and felt that it was not as strong as it should be.	No
14859	In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	No
9019	But for me, trying, in this very pluralistic society of our society, to frame any definition, whatever it is, of what this belief should be, is wrong.	No
1313	Over the course of two hundred years of history, there has been a very cautious approach.	No
14771	To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	No
13033	See that the young people of America, in particular, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	No
29241	Five million people lost their homes.	Yes
31937	We have seen him insult women.	Yes
13117	It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	No
1093	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	No
5889	It is the people, the Democrats and the Republicans who have shaped my ideas and who will surround me in the White House.	No
14027	I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.	No
26562	So I think we need to change the nature of politics.	No
6984	He already has 3 trillion dollars, according to the Washington Post, of expenses that he put online from his congress and the promises of this campaign, none of which is paid.	Yes
16271	That is why difficult choices will be needed, choices that I am prepared to make, Mr Bush is not ready to make.	No
25698	But in any event, I understand the problems.	No
17206	You are ultimately responsible for this work.	No
23489	The intelligence gathering and the weapons of the FBI law enforcement agencies could not share the intelligence under the old law.	Yes
13255	I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	No
17743	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	No
15666	And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	No
1788	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	Yes
29343	I wrote about that in my book...	No
9085	If we do not solve this problem, all the others will become useless.	No
25168	"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	No
7958	I think I should also add that with respect to Senator Kennedy's proposals, if he intends to implement his program - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is simply impossible for him to deliver on those promises without increasing taxes or having a rise in t- or both prices.	No
19360	They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	No
20663	In fact, in my draft ten-year budget, I reserved more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush did in his proposal.	Yes
6936	Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	No
11055	And the pressure that has been exerted on our alliances around the world and the respect that has been diminished over the last eight years have prevented us from acting on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we have neither the resources nor the allies to do everything we should do.	Yes
14677	Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	No
28962	Which of these promises will you keep and what will you break, Governor?	No
10825	So, Medicare, it's gonna be a little harder.	No
7521	And he said that.	No
12230	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	Yes
10339	I understand what it takes to restore a bright and prosperous future for America.	No
16792	"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	No
15531	I made a good selection.	No
7805	We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	No
33001	Why don't you put money on?	No
12720	Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	No
17715	Well, it's not going to go back.	No
884	The fact is that I have chosen someone who will not only be a great vice-president, but if, God forbid you, something happens to the president, could enter this office and do so with distinction, strength and leadership.	No
9359	You'll get your chance in a moment.	No
24304	We agree on nuclear power, but we have not yet protected these things.	No
25503	And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	Yes
2088	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	Yes
21412	When I was young, when I got out of the Navy, I had several job offers.	No
25857	But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	No
28734	We've got to change it.	No
19114	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those from here who can listen or watch.	No
17557	In 1983, because of these tax preferences, it paid just over 12 per cent, or 12.8 per cent in taxes.	Yes
24333	Our exports are growing dramatically.	Yes
15766	I believe that the primary responsibility of a president lies with the national security of this country.	No
876	Someone who would come to me if someone came with a crazy idea that we should exchange weapons at Ayatollah for hostages and say, â€°Â¥Mr.	No
6719	You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
16529	And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	No
20851	What I care about is children.	No
4307	But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	Yes
28626	I am for research and development.	No
15066	Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	No
7903	The President will always be President for the next four months and he is, of course, the only one who can engage this country in this period.	No
17477	I think, however, that your questions point to the fact that there is probably no way for the government to answer this question in every individual case and in the private life of the American people.	No
18467	I don't think he was misleading.	No
33703	China is growing at 7 percent.	Yes
21596	We hear all the negatives.	No
1018	But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	No
3104	In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.	Yes
3126	As I mentioned earlier, we agreed on a limitation of 24 hundred ballistic missile launchers.	Yes
9291	Because our energy is at low cost, which is already beginning to return because of our abundant energy.	Yes
23642	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	No
13154	The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.	No
6643	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	Yes
16944	I would have done it across the street.	No
20652	And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	No
29825	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	No
28354	(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	No
26030	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	No
11083	This requires a person who understands what we are -- the limits of our ability.	No
235	We're on the right track.	No
13596	It is also a deviation from the tax and expenditure economy, because you cannot tax and divide an economy that does not grow.	No
27858	The funding of universities and think tanks is excellent.	No
11812	But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	No
25346	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
12700	Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	No
22088	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	No
21774	I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	No
24342	"We said, ""Peace through strength,"" and it worked and the cold war is over."	No
19397	We should agree that someone else should do it.	No
3430	How's it going to affect my house?	No
28134	They're finding new remedies, and that's great.	No
27164	Let me go back and talk about what I think our mission should be in the Middle East and more broadly, because our goal is to make sure that the world is more - is peaceful.	No
29401	I think I should -- you go to his website, and you look at his website.	No
29796	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	No
21203	I think there must be instant disclosure on the Internet to find out who gave it to.	No
2496	It was not a government takeover of health care.	Yes
8220	They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	No
26320	We're not going to touch Medicare.	No
9183	Ask the rich to pay a little more with the cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	No
32153	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	No
30279	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	No
17365	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, as we were at the Olympics.	No
2032	Well, we've had this discussion before.	No
11983	Jim, I hope we can come back to the subject of education because the governor has made a long statement about it and I have a very different opinion than the one he has expressed.	No
6744	My opponent was against it.	No
26909	But instead, we have seen in nation after nation, a number of worrying events.	No
10857	The bad news is we've lost.	No
6991	We paid off the debt for two years.	Yes
33361	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	Yes
795	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I will make an agreement with you, I will take responsibility for these two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	No
17814	And the result is exactly what we see.	No
12835	If we strengthen the hopes of the world by organizing a summit conference that is not sufficiently prepared, and if Mr Khrushchev finds an excuse to break it - as he has done - because he has no right to get away with it - we could push back the cause of peace.	No
19132	It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	No
12335	A profound scientist recently made a different --	No
31904	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	No
19058	By being firm, determined and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace that we all want.	No
120	He also wants to spend a lot of money on other programs.	No
18877	And that's one of the things I learned at the White House, is that there's a huge pressure on the president, and he can't fade under that pressure.	No
12976	I don't think there's anything this country can't do.	No
10716	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	No
9448	The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	Yes
23127	Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	Yes
13212	"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	No
22130	Not all nuclear weapons are dismantled.	Yes
8809	We need an active reserve of one million men who could be called immediately, and who would also be trained, ready to use this type of equipment.	No
15984	I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.	No
34427	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	No
16492	I would therefore prefer, in this bill, an additional tax reduction and a further reduction in federal spending.	No
12392	I thought there were exaggerations on the numbers.	No
13257	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	No
16836	They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	Yes
23395	"You're just saying, ""We don't agree with you."""	No
2432	They put in place a plan, a bipartite plan.	Yes
8355	His experience was different from mine.	No
9562	I led the state of Massachusetts as governor, to the extent that any governor does, and I balanced the budget every four years.	Yes
32853	And he listens to Donald on TV and he once told his mother, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he is elected?	No
23697	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national television.	No
30229	No, they were teasing us.	No
18770	And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	No
20024	This is an issue they've brought up.	No
15110	And we're guilty of it.	No
13681	That's quite different than some.	No
17870	Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	Yes
2733	I am concerned about America's leadership over the past four years.	No
16143	We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	No
32166	But we have to cut costs.	No
6803	Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.	No
2191	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	Yes
7729	And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	No
17370	I said it's gonna take a lot of work.	No
1942	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	No
19259	I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.	Yes
16399	This election is about big things.	No
23776	Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	Yes
13920	Everybody says it'll create jobs.	No
528	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	Yes
3616	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	Yes
25595	I want this nation to protect its air, waters, lands and public health.	No
26347	We had a better idea.	No
24096	That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.	No
13702	It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.	No
8043	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	No
5700	Of course, we can take an axe and scalpel from that budget.	No
3132	Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	Yes
14538	Let's limit some of these guys sitting here tonight.	No
27627	So our troops will return home at that time.	Yes
2223	But people make their own choice.	No
29487	These are the types of things that will really stimulate the economy.	No
28705	I care a lot.	No
33915	... we have made school environments healthier for children, including healthier lunches...	Yes
14409	Who'll get hurt if we put these papers on the table?	No
17817	The latest report on new purchases is the lowest since 1982.	Yes
30	Entertainment industry, people involved in schools, education.	No
28318	They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	Yes
19804	I don't think for a moment that I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	No
29512	It shows the revenues -- in fact, the revenues -- I just looked at today -- the revenues are reported at $694 million for the past year, at $694 million.	Yes
15873	I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	No
19747	We've lost credibility around the world.	No
6706	Bob, anybody can play with these votes.	No
966	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	No
29989	And one of the things he did was let the cowardly cyberattacks hack government files, hack personal files, hack the National Democratic Committee.	Yes
22762	I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	No
27230	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	No
17448	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	No
15163	Yes, I'd be glad to.	No
6200	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	No
6666	And when I'm president, we're gonna close this loophole in a nanosecond and we're gonna use that money to cut corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, five percent.	No
14032	And it goes on and on.	No
34414	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	No
19152	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	Yes
8127	I am not satisfied when we have more than nine billion dollars of food - some of which rot - even if there is a hungry world, and even if four million Americans wait each month for a food package from the government, which is an average of five hundred a day per person.	Yes
28253	I think it's a mistake.	No
15364	I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.	No
2861	And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	No
13369	But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	No
34147	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	No
3293	Let me assure you that we have made all possible openings to the People's Republic of China and, through them, to the Government of Cambodia.	No
15637	And you supported the law this year that involved tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
27467	I would indict him for it.	No
7410	Allow me to compliment the President, if I may.	No
33022	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	Yes
1542	What matters is that the United States celebrated its 200th anniversary on July 4.	No
20062	I know it's a fact because I had one that told me last week, senator doesn't cut me off from health insurance.	No
19162	We'll have specific differences later.	No
2202	They will now have to pay co-payments for basic check-ups that can keep them healthier.	Yes
1241	It is impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they cannot predict what will happen next.	No
23450	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	No
17712	The interest rates are based on inflation.	No
20165	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	No
2918	But he also made sure there was bipartite support.	No
10972	And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.	Yes
19198	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	No
14272	We went to the United Nations, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	Yes
3297	And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	No
24106	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	No
13256	And the answer, of course, is that communist espionage continues all the time.	No
15589	There is no way to anticipate what can happen.	No
13165	It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.	No
11564	I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.	No
15712	We are in serious stages of negotiations with the Soviet Union on strategic arms control talks.	Yes
22994	No, but he's to weaken him.	No
16476	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	Yes
21224	It was a good, lively exchange.	No
15246	And let me add the word security; it must be done with maximum security.	No
20257	It's a difference of opinion.	No
20206	And in this election, America must make an important choice.	No
8480	It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	No
23424	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	No
21028	Now he has to say it again.	No
17315	With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about it.	No
6586	I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	No
25619	I am grateful for the opportunity to reaffirm my commitment to reducing nuclear weapons and, one day, eliminating them completely.	No
12872	If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	No
8275	Uh - I made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary, I made some recommendations regarding the situation of Hungarian refugees that were adopted, not only by the President, but some of them were promulgated by Congress.	Yes
3850	But that's Senate inside baseball.	No
16020	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
12041	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	Yes
3958	I am therefore not prepared to threaten him, as Senator Obama seems to want to do, as he said he would announce military strikes in Pakistan.	Yes
26575	I would be willing to have another debate this year.	No
20641	The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	No
19767	Under no circumstances should it be politicized by the President or his opponent.	No
16829	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	Yes
19829	I applaud them, I don't criticize them.	No
15660	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	No
3988	And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	No
33874	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	Yes
28323	I firmly believe that the federal government can help, we must fund Headstart.	No
25584	This evening we talked about national strength.	No
2365	I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.	No
1982	Just let me finish their point, because you're looking for the contrast.	No
30233	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	Yes
22272	It's terrible to caress little children all over town.	No
25251	And let's talk about the people we control.	No
11362	I believe in his future.	No
12114	And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	Yes
8077	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	No
6808	What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	No
1785	And by giving them these tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	No
23670	Put a fake head on us.	No
16570	I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	No
8155	I think we can do a better job.	No
25009	I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.	No
34335	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	No
11869	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	No
6849	One of the main reasons why health care costs are increasing is that this administration has hampered common sense efforts that would have reduced costs.	No
26431	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage sectors and we will have more manufacturing and sales worldwide.	Yes
22304	School choice - public, private or religious.	No
15188	If President Brezhnev has said that we will abolish this treaty, negotiated under three American presidents over a period of seven years, we insist on nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that launching a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it is obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposal.	No
22089	Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	No
4341	We're going to need more cooperation with our allies.	No
12975	I want Mr Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe, Italy and the Pacific for freedom during the Second World War took over from the United States, and that they are going to put this country back to work.	No
19895	If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	No
18111	The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	No
23875	Now I know that the only way to win is to make everyone believe that the economy is worse than it is.	No
14389	This goes on night and day.	No
15755	And all these things will have to be addressed.	No
21496	Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.	Yes
2222	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	No
22610	After September 11, we had to look at the world differently.	No
24201	Small businesses - you must have capital, you must credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	No
6099	You won't pay a fine, because...	No
5564	When Senator Obama finished his conversation with Joe the plumber, we must spread wealth.	No
16810	And eleven of them have been overtaken.	Yes
33417	We will not have open borders.	No
6322	And we all know the state of Washington's school system, D.C.	No
8451	My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	No
8830	Well, let me say that, as far as this same missile system is concerned, I am supporting and believing in this missile itself.	No
12024	The law-abiding citizens will do so.	No
4258	Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.	Yes
19783	That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	No
2456	Let me make one last point.	No
32985	I'm looking for judges -- and I've chosen 20 for people to see, respect, think, and in fact, very well examined by almost everyone.	No
10051	But I find it more troubling than that, than the day after the assassination of the United States Ambassador, the first time this has happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, the president, the next day, flies to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser, then the next day in Colorado for another event, another political event.	Yes
22206	I care a lot, and I spent countless hours at school.	No
24204	This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.	No
13482	Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	No
28038	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know we all want to express our sympathy and condolences to Jean, the family and the Sifford family.	No
15182	And I would say to the Soviet Union that we are going to sit down and negotiate with you for as long as it takes, not only to have a legitimate arms limitation, but also a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that either of us poses a threat to the other.	No
14027	I'd like them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have representatives of foreign countries working on their campaigns.	No
19161	That's my difference with the President.	No
9739	He didn't call for self-deportation.	No
27673	And I do not blame the administration for the fact that relations with Pakistan are tense.	Yes
1181	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	No
7497	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care if an idea is a Republican idea or a Democratic idea.	No
10935	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	No
17278	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	No
17830	No, I might as well just go with -- --	No
29851	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	No
11695	And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.	No
3361	Or a world where people have enough food and a world where we care about those who don't?	No
18084	As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	No
1663	Over the past 30 months, 5 million jobs have been created in the private sector.	Yes
23620	And I have to make that judgment.	No
19207	We experienced the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	Yes
19462	You come in, you put your little card in there.	No
25220	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	Yes
6266	Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	No
17252	And I don't think -- I think, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I couldn't -- I would be the stupidest man in the world if I thought I could confront the tasks of the office I hold if I couldn't turn to someone who was stronger and bigger than all the others.	No
20	We ran away, we got the impression that free education was the thing.	No
17486	Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	No
24949	He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	No
27165	We want a peaceful planet.	No
27495	But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	No
15936	And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	No
14700	First of all, I would like to thank the committee and my opponents for participating in these debates and for making them possible.	No
27602	And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	No
32193	You'll have the best health care plan there is.	No
29698	So we need to bring communities together to start working on this as a mutual goal.	No
12612	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	No
6230	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	Yes
16288	We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	No
24963	I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	No
11509	As far as the timetables are concerned, this cannot be the United States timetable as to how the discussions take place.	No
922	I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been at the forefront in favour of other energy sources and one of them is gasohol and comes from the use of your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradability for many products, so I am optimistic about the agricultural economy.	No
159	And remember that the federal deficit fell by $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	Yes
10835	You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?	Yes
34334	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	No
12795	I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	No
29852	We must therefore work better, once again, with communities, religious communities, the business community, as well as with the police to try to solve this problem.	No
22772	I would not deal with Arafat, because I had the impression that he had dropped the former president, and I do not think he is the kind of person who can lead to a Palestinian state.	No
19738	The Mideast is very difficult.	No
26915	And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	No
30081	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	Yes
8690	We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	Yes
20631	This would be the time to seriously consider the use of force.	No
7983	Now, by highlighting things that are not right, I think we should focus on America's strengths.	No
9231	That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	No
16345	And there are more, if you're talking about percentage of appointments, more members of Congress who have been surveyed percentage-sense than people in the executive.	Yes
15169	The Senate has not yet voted on the Strategic Arms Control Treaty.	No
6044	We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	No
26410	That's what we're gonna do.	No
12634	The others abstained or voted against us.	Yes
15924	It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	No
7477	But I can take it.	No
29486	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	No
8834	We need the missile, I think, because we are so strategically unbalanced that we lack deterrence for a possible first assault.	No
13917	And I got a long history of doing that.	Yes
33173	They will protect the second amendment.	No
32030	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	No
18817	We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	Yes
19949	He cut the money to clean up the toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our children still living less than 4 miles from a toxic waste dump, by a third.	Yes
25376	But suppose we came up with that?	No
19380	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	No
13154	The Soviet Union cannot accept an inspection system.	No
15306	I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.	Yes
25895	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever it can reasonably do.	No
4085	They financed Hezbollah, Hamas, they went from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	Yes
23680	And I'll take responsibility for them.	No
25295	And one of those dreams is justice.	No
14710	It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.	Yes
24603	We have doubled it on research and on all other aspects of it.	Yes
2809	And the last point I want to say is this: Mr Ford, Mr Kissinger continued with Richard Nixon's policies and failures.	No
17533	And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.	Yes
7851	One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	No
3638	Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	No
1562	I don't believe the present administration has done that.	No
13770	And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	Yes
13851	Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	No
5514	And I insisted on basic principles: ensuring that the taxpayer can recover his money if he puts money in place.	Yes
4109	But I reserve the right, as President of the United States, to meet with anyone at a time and place of my choice if I think it will keep America safe.	No
6312	I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.	No
3684	There are things I think I have to do.	No
9609	We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	Yes
27629	And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	No
8805	In 1977, we took him away from the army.	Yes
16520	And, uh - these projections were made very carefully.	No
9709	I came through small business.	No
12643	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	Yes
31996	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	Yes
25914	I think we need to go back and take a look.	No
32600	And as president, I'll take this work, this bipartite work, this common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to do things in Washington.	No
12235	You know the Japanese are blowing at us.	No
19753	It is a very difficult environment.	No
17096	Interest rates have fallen by about 9 or 10 points and we believe that they should fall further.	Yes
6304	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	No
8128	I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	No
21223	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	No
34431	I have made the cause of children and families the work of my life.	No
24617	Is the behaviour you use likely to cause AIDS?	No
23235	I have a proposal for a tax reduction for all people who earn less than $200,000.	No
14625	And you can take it on the charts, you look at all the studies that the different groups have done, you come out 4, 5, 6 years, we are still drifting with a huge deficit.	Yes
16895	It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	No
34050	What I'm saying is, I'm gonna tell you at that time.	No
14768	And, the last, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	No
21380	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	Yes
24746	And you must have cost control, yes.	No
26633	And it's still the economic package.	No
25180	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	No
26103	And the government doesn't create jobs.	No
20085	Well, I would say that the first homelessness bill in the Senate was Bill Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole, I don't remember who was in control at the time.	Yes
13483	I think we have been right in carrying it.	No
24373	They're making progress, not enough for us.	No
28651	And so let's do it for the most part, but not completely eliminate it for the same top.	No
8179	Where, then, do we disagree?	No
5501	Let's take 300 of this billion and buy these mortgages and negotiate with these people in their homes, 11 million or more houses, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their homes.	No
4197	It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	No
5790	That's what campaigns should be done.	No
23976	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	Yes
7725	And yet this same committee, of which I am the chairman, has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had the right funds; we do not have the right powers; we do not have the right staff.	No
26223	But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.	No
7995	You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	Yes
9520	The opening up of more trade, particularly in Latin America.	No
10674	The three you mentioned are imperative national security requirements.	No
8420	Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	Yes
28262	I firmly believe in local control of schools.	No
30012	I have just been approved by ICE.	No
19178	He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	Yes
34355	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	No
28054	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	Yes
18900	We have to do this job.	No
23007	And I accept what the president said.	No
1004	Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	No
1300	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	Yes
24940	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	No
16303	Why have there been these safety violations?	No
23753	I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.	No
6222	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America.	No
27584	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	No
24498	Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	Yes
2965	In fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania to ensure that the people of those countries understood that the President of the United States and the people of the United States were committed to their independence, autonomy and freedom.	No
23727	Now I voted as I voted because I saw that he had a bad policy and I wanted to be accountable.	No
19208	The average family income has increased by more than $1,600 since the adoption of our economic plan.	Yes
10203	When -- when he was asked would class size...	No
21616	Help me pass these programs.	No
17852	I promised a new start.	No
1252	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	Yes
7691	There were only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the Voting Bill passed in 1957 and the Voting Bill passed in 1960.	Yes
83	And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	No
19979	You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.	No
27790	These were counterfeit products manufactured abroad with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, which were sold in our market and worldwide as if they were manufactured by the U.S. competitor.	Yes
14087	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	Yes
33378	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
17651	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	Yes
26782	And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	No
12794	So one more effort should be made.	No
27091	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	No
26524	Now that's not a government takeover.	No
27366	It's not driven by politics.	Yes
30262	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	Yes
26052	And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	No
22025	You have a raging debate about those plans.	No
4402	I'm ready to go at it right now.	No
24018	I have cut defense spending.	Yes
26320	We're not going to get medicare.	No
16558	There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	No
17484	Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	No
34321	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	No
27506	I think they saw weakness where they expected to find American strength.	No
7863	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	No
26032	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	Yes
33785	You know, in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
24958	This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	No
8215	And on the basis of this account, I believe that we have the secret of progress, we know the way forward.	No
9916	I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	No
26603	You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	No
5626	If we invest now to ensure that people have coverage, that we prevent diseases, it will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	Yes
8948	And this state, we control spending.	Yes
22244	Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	No
11135	...just a quick follow-up on this.	No
8807	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	No
15425	We must have a fair and equitable society.	No
3430	How's that gonna affect my house?	No
6829	Therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	Yes
15945	And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided	No
24094	People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	Yes
14596	"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, look at your wallet."	No
4284	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he's talking about Arizona.	No
23138	First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	Yes
27589	The problem is that on a whole series of issues, be it the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, whether it is Iran now, you have been on the map.	No
16245	So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	No
29102	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we will build together.	No
16010	We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	No
23994	This old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich--we're going to soak the rich--he always ends up being the poor taxi driver or the worker who ends up paying the bill.	No
24468	It can be a single-parent family.	No
31852	Well, I actually agree with that.	No
3150	I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.	No
18470	As policy changes, its positions change.	No
17670	And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	No
23197	I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	Yes
22486	This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	Yes
13394	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union, even though the growth of this administration has been twice as large as that of the Truman administration; that is not enough.	Yes
9624	Now, one of the reasons I managed to get so many good women to be part of this team was because of our recruitment effort.	No
12523	I believe that there are certain principles that we need to find by dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will maintain peace and that can also extend freedom.	No
534	We must commit ourselves to being involved and to being the leader.	No
10821	That's what we need, and that's what I did in Washington.	No
28379	He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	No
25245	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	No
15940	So, what I'm saying is, we're gonna have to make choices.	No
16306	Someone has to take responsibility for it.	No
6379	We must provide quality education for all our citizens, and not just for the privileged few.	No
8958	We think it's too much extra money to get out of the pockets of the people.	No
1780	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	No
29036	I deeply believe that you must be ready to stand up and fight whatever the powerful forces on the other side.	No
14431	And nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there has not been a single scintilla of evidence that there is American technology involved.	Yes
26989	I have clear eyes on this.	No
5956	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	No
18234	I believe they want to.	No
27554	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had known missiles that were raining from Hamas.	No
6595	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
3878	We don't want our children back here.	No
22274	At the end of the first day, this little child wants to go out.	No
24583	I think Governor Clinton is engaged.	No
16505	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	No
11573	Now, I wanted to take up one of the statements earlier, and maybe I heard, maybe I heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	No
8074	All I can say is that we have programs in all these areas - education, housing, defence - that will advance America.	No
3131	In the meantime, there has been the development on our part mainly, cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, such as the B-52 or the B-1, that I hope we are proceeding with; cruise missiles that could be launched from surface or submarine vessels - naval.	Yes
19305	In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.	Yes
12262	I think we need to have clean coal technologies.	No
1079	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	Yes
18370	It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	No
16285	And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	No
24561	Again, the White House is an insulting chair.	No
29962	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	No
970	We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	No
24127	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	Yes
11881	We can fill a gap in delivery, and that begins by ensuring that we have strong accountability, Jim.	No
9394	This is not an energy strategy for the future.	No
33996	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	Yes
700	We know where they're cutting.	No
32017	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	No
12210	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	Yes
16273	I ask Mr Gorbachev to join us in limiting the elimination of the regional conflict in the Middle East and Central America.	No
10853	But when we can - when we have a problem that we can give our children and grandchildren a damaged planet, I disagree with the Bush administration on this issue.	No
23055	You know what he said?	No
503	So that's the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can approve a $35 billion program does not mean that I have less compassion than the person who supports such a program.	No
24543	There is a criminal bill that, lamentably, has been blocked from passing once again, mainly by the Republicans in the U.S. Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	Yes
18615	That's why it's essential we win.	No
417	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	No
12077	But I think we -- I think we need to start with better education.	No
14962	This is a heartless approach to the families who work in our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under the leadership of Governor Reagan.	No
16482	And in the budget I recommended, we cut it by half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 1/2 per cent.	Yes
32584	You could have done it, if you were an effective senator -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
12516	How can we extend freedom - extending it without war?	No
25563	Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	No
16608	Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	Yes
6316	It's not gonna happen on its own.	No
1344	What we have to do, and that is the main problem, is to make it very, very difficult for a person who uses a weapon in the commission of a crime to stay out of prison.	No
19638	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	No
17817	Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	Yes
10757	This is an example of unfair burden-sharing.	No
2075	And if we don't ask for income, that means we have to get rid of a lot of stuff.	No
12235	You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.	No
25683	I want to thank you and everyone here tonight.	No
20160	And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.	No
26073	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.	Yes
13526	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries over the past three years — Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana in the last eighteen months — both support Soviet foreign policy at the UN. Mr. Herter said so himself.	Yes
16804	And the cost of unemployment compensation, social assistance and income losses has increased by $23 billion over the past two years.	Yes
382	The government was very involved; the housing industry was involved; the banking industry was involved; housing advocates were involved; not-for-profit organizations were involved; governors, mayors, and people across the country who believed deeply in property and affordable housing.	No
27148	That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	No
2364	A woman came to see me and she told me I couldn't afford insurance for myself or my son.	No
21820	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	No
12063	Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.	No
7284	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	Yes
13092	I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	No
2802	In addition, we were afraid to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	No
16751	In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.	Yes
16241	Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.	No
11411	That's what a chief executive officer does.	No
23578	He's not talking about America's equality.	No
21549	Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	No
33950	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	Yes
5626	If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	Yes
22247	Those schools belong to you.	No
18521	And that's one of the reasons I think I can do this job, because I'm determined for these soldiers and for these families, for those kids who put their lives at risk.	No
9403	So I have the last question -- last answer --	No
14033	And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	No
29109	We also have to make the economy fairer.	No
16802	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	Yes
8914	We saw what happened.	No
9064	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	No
10987	It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.	No
387	Washington, per se, can't do anything.	No
16830	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	Yes
8182	Last year, of course, it was 1958.	No
17309	Yes, it's very difficult to refute, because I agree so much with Mr. Mondale.	No
13259	What I am opposed to here is the constant reference to the abandonment of these islands.	No
9648	Now, there are other issues that have an impact on how women succeed in the workplace.	No
15241	The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	Yes
26836	Maybe have a chance to be president.	No
4060	Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	No
17964	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	No
19185	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	No
32284	First, we have Muslims in America from George Washington.	Yes
11408	One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	No
6860	Health insurance is intended for the elderly, many of whom have fixed incomes, to get them out of poverty.	Yes
2328	But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	Yes
14954	We have a program to gradually reduce government spending based on these theories, and I now have a working group working on where these reductions could be made.	No
23886	Well, they've got a point.	No
25526	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	Yes
6695	We've created a 10 percent band to help low-income Americans.	Yes
32175	It's such a big question and maybe that's the question that I get almost more than anything else, outside the defense.	No
26689	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	Yes
7612	Mr Morgan, I suggested that if the United States had the impression that it could save the summit conference, it would have been appropriate for us to express our regret.	No
894	I wanted to stop at his house in his tank with him.	No
15606	And I won't do anything else that he had to do: he's raised $29 million from his state pension fund, which is equivalent to the federal level to draw on the social security trust fund.	Yes
33097	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	No
27382	Let's talk about military spending, and that's it.	No
10564	And the next president has to make sure that the next secretary of the Treasury thinks about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a landlord, and not just think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	No
27472	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	No
11738	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	No
2929	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	Yes
10082	It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	No
25126	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the only great tragedy when they were killed in this suicide bombing of the building.	Yes
7232	One way or another, they're packed in.	No
23430	Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	No
20317	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	No
21762	For 38 years, a party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a small sorry post office that can do nothing good and a bank that has more discoveries than all the Chase Bank and Citibank combined.	Yes
22708	I'm gonna practice for our troops.	No
9256	And we can do this in an environmentally friendly way.	No
34280	We have had millions of people who have left Syria and those millions of people in Syria who have been dislocated.	Yes
6240	"But there is certainly a common ground when those who believe in choice and those who oppose abortion can come together and say: ""We should try to prevent unwanted pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our young people, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be involved in cavalry, offering adoption options and helping single mothers if they want to keep the baby."""	No
14187	It's just something else than taking a position where you know it's better for you.	No
8317	I therefore do not believe that this is a clear enough break with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	No
6927	It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	No
33100	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	No
8808	Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	No
15644	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	No
355	And we've got to attend to them.	No
24143	And the best way to do this is not to impose and spend, but to recycle, to get control of mandatory spending programs.	No
11552	I don't think he would have fallen if we hadn't used force.	No
22049	They're just writing a note for the interest.	No
8730	All these things can be done.	No
27393	Now we're changing into one conflict.	Yes
13264	Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	No
16349	Let's say it's not Democratic or Republican, and it's not Liberal or Conservative.	No
23680	And I'll take responsibility for it.	No
1028	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	No
10930	One of the things I said from the beginning of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment and an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	Yes
13135	They were not in the Treaty area when it was adopted in fifty-five years.	Yes
12359	I -- of course, there is a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	No
230	But we didn't have the kind of leadership we should have had.	No
8525	We should support the Department of Justice in its efforts and the FBI, and we should be constantly vigilant.	No
3915	And at present, commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have recognized that we do not have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we have even more troops in Iraq than we did before the push.	Yes
33892	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	No
15415	In addition, I would like to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such welcoming guests over the last few hours of my life.	No
7134	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in recent years.	Yes
26845	We talked about our responsibilities tonight.	No
14233	And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.	No
14176	There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	Yes
22206	So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	No
29923	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	No
28713	And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.	No
12401	And I'll try to do better.	No
31898	Yeah, I'm very embarrassed about that.	No
24437	There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	Yes
3894	Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.	No
34416	Your husband doesn't agree with you.	No
28842	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	No
24567	We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	No
19674	There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.	No
2406	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	Yes
3758	I have been interested in this for many years and I am proud of the work I have done with Senator Clinton.	No
16031	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	No
2024	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	No
15786	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, in Congress.	No
22160	I think we will have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
8204	But let's not put it there, let's say in terms of average family.	No
273	We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	No
1013	Your policy does not really mean that we are going to have a fairly high unemployment rate over a fairly long period of time, that growth will be slow enough, and that we will not be able to do much - very in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in cities, in health, in transit and many things like that.	No
20625	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	No
2365	I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said we thought we'd give up our insurance, we can't afford it.	No
22999	I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	No
15625	Margaret, may I come back and tell the vice president that I didn't attack the Massachusetts pension fund, you're wrong, George, we didn't do that.	Yes
28909	There's been some tough business on my desk.	No
18195	Anyway, that's for another debate.	No
12905	He says that he voted for the resolution.	Yes
23980	I did not question that man's patriotism.	No
13646	You have had a number of opportunities to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you will understand it.	No
3895	First of all, let's talk about this question of troop financing because John always talks about it.	No
13431	The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	Yes
27966	Bob, Mr. President, the people at Lynn University, happy to be with you.	No
25340	And we were the safety valve, whether we wanted it or not, with the illegal entry here in Mexico, where their population is growing and they do not have an economy that can absorb them and provide jobs.	Yes
15382	When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	Yes
19274	This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	No
427	It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.	Yes
33247	And this will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I put pro-life judges on the court.	No
20539	I believe that judges should not replace the legislative power of the government.	No
24985	But between us, we can either destroy the world or save it.	No
11919	There may be another law that was already in the books, but certainly the defenders of the Hate Crimes Act felt that a difficult new law was needed.	No
19395	They know the Republican Party didn't do it.	No
22331	Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.	No
6549	That costs the government $7,700 per family.	Yes
33322	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and many other people.	No
27441	They can take the diplomatic route and put an end to their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a president of the United States, I said we will not take options out of the table.	No
618	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	No
28373	And that's because we've structured the plan so that six million more American families don't pay taxes.	Yes
32342	How can we do what he has advocated without causing great distress in our own county?	No
30389	She has experience, but it's a bad experience.	No
24755	Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.	No
13364	I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	No
24509	And I object, and I will stand up and continue to oppose it.	No
9342	And so what we did was take those leases off.	No
15831	No, let me tell you something about that.	No
17241	Then, in 1982, they used this proposal demagogically for the 1982 campaign.	No
8701	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	No
6744	My opponent was against it.	No
14685	They don't want us talking about each other.	No
7971	And I'd like to know where we were defeated and where we got back?	No
13267	The reason why Indochina was preserved is the result of the Geneva Conference in Indochina.	Yes
6981	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	Yes
34246	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	No
29805	They've got a lot of concerns.	No
12845	He hoped that there would be some agreement on disarmament.	No
11208	And once they feel safe, they lead a normal, social, economic, political life, the same thing that is happening in Iraq today.	Yes
19877	You attended a private school for some time in your life.	No
17886	Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	No
12986	And let's straighten the file now by looking at the file, as Al Smith said.	No
195	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	No
10841	And we'll get our economy going again.	No
29323	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go wherever you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacturing is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	Yes
26354	We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	No
27992	We have been blessed to have a free and prosperous nation thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	No
15242	Over the past year, our government has withdrawn millions of acres of public land that were once multi-purpose public land, mineral exploration, and so on.	Yes
17428	But I finally did.	No
27114	I do not think it is necessary to put our military in Syria at this stage.	No
22029	Let us make sure that this thing is as good as we all think at the end of the meeting.	No
4091	We need tougher sanctions.	No
33630	But they have to pay up.	No
16667	But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	No
7716	"Unless the president speaks, then, of course, the country does not speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre-heu - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	No
30142	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	No
14596	"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."	No
8947	Now I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I have taken over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh economic power of the world.	Yes
27698	Is Al-Qaida running on his heels?	No
2793	We have an opportunity to talk this evening, first of all, about the leadership, the character of our country, and a vision for the future.	No
13953	And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	Yes
17712	Interest rates are based on inflation.	No
15807	He went out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against all hope, about what is really happening in Cuba.	No
8491	Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	No
19768	And I don't intend to politicize it.	No
17199	And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.	Yes
1430	And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.	No
9256	And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.	No
32010	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	Yes
16833	The person who works on average can't enjoy it, but the richest people can.	No
8734	That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	No
12854	But until we are strong here, until we move here, I believe that a summit could not succeed.	No
11400	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	No
110	Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.	No
3160	This has got to be stopped.	No
9288	This is not the right path for America.	No
34151	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you voted in favour.	Yes
11166	... to -- to -- to...	No
6498	"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	No
19668	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	No
197	But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	No
18446	I've worked with these leaders the president is talking about, I've worked with them for 20 years, longer than this president.	Yes
12560	Firmness, but not the belligerent, and by no belligerent I mean that we do not respond to insult by insult.	No
25069	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I proposed a budget that would increase the strength of our nation, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	No
15659	I think my father would be quite proud of me, because I think we've come a long way and I think that, you know, three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had erased me.	No
27354	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	Yes
27034	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	No
32829	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	No
11329	I come from very modest means.	No
12932	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	No
33393	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	Yes
2208	And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.	Yes
34212	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	No
20027	And that's what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past, but what all the other presidents have done.	No
8029	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	No
23995	And so I just have a different approach.	No
21551	So I'm going to make the commitment and stay on the issues.	No
12798	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	No
4141	He did not say that.	No
13636	And we're bleeding arterially.	No
14970	The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	Yes
14242	You want to have a new program in this country.	No
28111	So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	No
14646	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask that question about trust, because I think there's a model of Governor Clinton to say one thing to please one group, and then try to please another group.	Yes
2130	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	No
13968	I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	No
32472	I wish you'd done that.	No
7589	Senator Kennedy also said about Cuba that he thought I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba by not asking for free elections in that country.	Yes
14955	I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	Yes
27397	Bob, I just need to comment on this.	No
21823	Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.	No
3610	At this time, in the United States of America, companies are paying the second highest corporate tax rate in the world, 35 per cent.	Yes
13642	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	No
19836	There are funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they are free of bureaucracy and can only remain in existence if they execute and teach children.	Yes
768	But sometimes the point is action...	No
8871	In fact, just this week, the crown jewel in this program he designed was stolen, I suppose, because a conference committee rejected the ambitious plan that he should increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	Yes
8047	I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	No
32739	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	Yes
21263	I know one thing about the position of president, it is the only position of our Constitution that is fulfilled by a person who is entrusted with the responsibility of fighting not only for a state or a district or for the rich, but also for the whole people, including those who need the most from someone who stands up and takes all the powerful forces that might oppose it.	No
1796	Now, that's not my analysis.	No
17490	Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	No
22981	That is a strange thing to say, since we have tripled the internal security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
9055	That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	No
28426	Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	Yes
106	And let me explain to you my own strategy to reduce this deficit, because as the executive head who is balanced ten consecutive budgets, I had to make these difficult decisions and those difficult choices.	Yes
25862	America owes you a debt of gratitude.	No
2815	And this is one of the major stakes of this 1976 campaign.	No
30088	How do we protect our people?	No
487	One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	No
1489	I think to be exact, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	Yes
34175	We need to go after the leadership.	No
1368	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	Yes
19629	In my opinion, politics has failed.	No
6861	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	Yes
2926	After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	Yes
1915	My priority is to get people back to work in America.	No
1874	Companies employ a quarter of all workers in America.	Yes
25119	Oh, there were occasional fire and sometimes artillery fire, but we did not engage in a conflict that was not in line with our mission.	No
96	Panama is a friendly country.	No
13522	A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.	Yes
8667	Although we have seen signs of hope, perhaps in the flash report for the third quarter, that the economy may be emerging from the recession, we have also seen the rise in the premium rate; we have seen mortgage rates recover again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	Yes
16701	But our nation's energy policy has not yet been established under this administration.	Yes
24954	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	No
12445	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	No
27120	And it's not... it won't be necessary.	No
2202	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	Yes
32002	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	No
15687	We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	No
22500	I want to make America as big as possible and I ask you to help it do so.	No
13309	Also as far as religion is concerned.	No
28280	It is based on Governor Jim Hunt's plan in North Carolina, and it works well.	Yes
6578	I'm gonna change that.	No
30342	And that's a big problem.	No
32259	But one thing we need to do is make sure that -- because there is a problem.	No
23716	And you can't say, because Saddam could have done it in 10 years, that's a reason, that's an excuse.	No
20458	I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	No
13680	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	No
21913	It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	No
20663	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	Yes
1079	And the testimony under oath was that I did not speak to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Haldeman, Mr. Ehrlichman, or any of the White House people.	Yes
28487	In conclusion, I have begun to say that for eight years I have been a member of the National Security Council.	No
14849	I would add that there are also decisions taken within the Oval Bureau by each President which are of a profound nature.	No
16206	The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	No
3136	It is therefore the President's obligation to do so, and I intend to do so.	No
25165	On the other things you just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you'd do.	No
14567	I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
13800	I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	No
14516	I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.	Yes
23975	I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	Yes
21201	I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	No
15042	I did the same thing in appointing women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	Yes
3227	It is a leadership role that the United States is playing under this administration, and if we do, and I believe that opportunities and opportunities are improving, we will have solved many of the internal problems that currently exist in South Korea.	No
32645	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	No
10596	If less money comes, you'll end up making cuts.	No
19003	I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.	No
3982	And I know how to work with them.	No
24360	So I'd be firm.	No
3582	You know it's tripled in the last five years?	Yes
24257	And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	No
5793	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	No
14318	So we have a long history of having many talented women.	Yes
6723	In fact, your case is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the Conservative Senator of Massachusetts.	No
7873	If we believe that we need to do more, that we need to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent of the post called Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who supported Castro in Latin America.	Yes
5578	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	No
24461	Well, I would say that a meeting that made a profound impression to me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said that the decline of urban America is the result of the decline of the American family.	No
15081	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	No
4318	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	No
20998	My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.	No
18258	You have to help us out there.	No
33284	I have been in countries where governments have either forced women to have abortions, as they used to do in China, or forced women to carry children, as they did in Romania.	Yes
17755	And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	No
17600	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	No
9174	I said we're betting on American workers and the U.S. auto industry and it's coming back.	No
32207	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	No
17892	Will our children be better off?	No
11942	I'm gonna be respectful of people who might not agree with me.	No
25941	They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	Yes
22192	We must therefore innovate through the choice of school.	No
5837	And I -- and we've always said that's not appropriate.	No
11363	I believe in his greatness.	No
7828	Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	No
19130	Now, I am a clear-speaker man and I learned a long time ago that your word was your bond.	No
16091	So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	No
26964	But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	No
32207	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	No
1016	No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	Yes
14184	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	No
23197	I just told that lady that we spent -- $10 to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	Yes
21016	Instead of high unemployment, we have the lowest rates of African-American and Latin American unemployment in history and 22 million new jobs.	Yes
17571	I don't think we can do that for a few years.	No
24801	Aren't you tired of being treated like an unscheduled robot?	No
12467	I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.	No
23873	I don't think Mr. Perot feels that way, but I know that Governor Clinton did it because I want to quote it precisely.	No
32991	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	No
23299	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	No
10631	And then let's watch our records as well as our rhetoric.	No
23920	So there are differences, but this is about the main area where I think we have a difference.	No
25912	We had to make some cuts.	No
22896	One of the most important things we do in this administration is transformation.	No
28721	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	No
24210	I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	Yes
2718	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	No
7907	We must not build the hopes of the world and break them as we did in Paris.	No
5987	Now, since the beginning of this campaign, I have identified this as one of my top priorities and here's what I think we need to do.	No
11577	Am I wrong?	No
8257	Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	No
5986	It's mortgaging our children's future.	No
18796	They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	No
571	The question is values; the question is strength; the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that needs to be provided.	No
25190	Yes, it relates to our disarmament talks.	No
2005	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
18056	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	No
20093	I didn't just have more power and more power.	No
29440	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	Yes
13193	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	Yes
1757	We need to bring these dollars back to the United States and go to the workers so they can create their own ways to get the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	No
16832	Another one that is, uh - it's very important is the uh - business deductions, uh - jet, uh - first-class travel, $50 martini lunch.	No
14988	"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."""	No
7256	My opponent, the senator, is talking about foreign policy.	No
32776	So I think it might help.	No
22448	Now I have to go back to one thing in my clothes because I'm passionate about education.	No
3544	It's completely out of control.	No
6340	It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	No
20390	He said that all poor seniors.	No
6349	And I have to tell you that the right ones, where they are requested and where they are accepted, are a good and achievable system.	No
7860	In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	No
15417	I had to make thousands of decisions, and each of these decisions was a learning process.	No
19345	I think Senator Dole and I do not agree.	No
1186	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uh... very high responsibilities on important committees.	No
10159	But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	No
20751	We are talking about a massive government.	No
24695	The average of older people now spends a higher percentage of their income on health care than in 1965, prior to the entry of health insurance.	Yes
5492	They're hurting, and they're angry.	No
16785	Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.	No
1181	I feel quite comfortable knowing that one day, Senator Mondale might very well be a chair.	No
8119	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	No
1465	Under the current administration - that of Nixon and that of Ford - we have had three times the rate of inflation we have known under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
33549	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	Yes
16686	Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
21196	This man surpassed me and special interests surpassed me.	Yes
968	Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.	No
7669	Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	No
33044	You're looking at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China pouring large quantities of steel across the United States, which essentially kills our steel mills and steel companies.	Yes
19950	It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	Yes
11032	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	No
21655	Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	No
12759	Now Senator Kennedy has spoken about the vote on Communist China.	No
13518	Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	Yes
32338	But we will have the control that is as difficult as it must be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	No
2427	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.	Yes
9808	He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	No
2211	So that's -- that's number one.	No
7936	I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.	No
24150	And the sooner they start, the sooner they finish.	No
16662	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	No
26200	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you're saying the other person's ideas are old.	No
8029	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it is my judgment since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line must be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	No
21816	I think you have to take on medical fraud.	No
27301	First time one state had been number one in all four measures.	Yes
7793	I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	No
18273	I'm going to bring a new credibility, a new start, and we're going to do the job right.	No
9251	And all these things have contributed to bringing our oil imports down to the lowest levels in 16 years.	Yes
31959	I'm going to help the city dwellers.	No
3523	The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	No
17678	Number one, we need to lower debt to lower interest rates so that the economy develops and people are employed.	No
27057	What we have done is to organize the international community, saying that Assad must leave.	Yes
26170	The president has been AWOL for four years.	No
16094	And I have made some good sound proposals.	No
29116	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	No
351	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and figure out if it was good to let all these mentally ill people out.	No
25468	The last point is that we can use that money we save on these weapons to spend on things we really need.	No
27065	And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	No
9730	And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	Yes
13368	So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.	No
16389	So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.	No
20223	I come from West Texas.	No
366	But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	No
23764	And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	No
32766	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	No
20378	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	Yes
19439	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	Yes
12698	By cutting trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have done, we will quarantine this regime so that the Cuban people themselves can take care of Mr Castro.	Yes
32817	You go to downtown and -- you see it's poverty at 45 percent.	Yes
11647	But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	No
20831	Here are the key ingredients.	No
7947	And I'm just saying that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States for a difficult time; but I wouldn't want people to elect me because I promised them easy and gentle life.	No
8329	But I would propose to keep that income up, not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy suggested to raise prices, but a program that would compensate the farmer, would pay the farmer in kind, uh - products that are in surplus.	No
11172	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	No
22565	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million less than you should be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	Yes
11914	Turns out we have a book law that's a hate crime law in Texas.	No
25420	It's nuclear war.	No
13274	Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	Yes
11217	I said I looked in his eyes and saw three letters, one K, one G and one B.	No
23879	Many of them exchanged it.	No
16827	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, let's say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay taxes on the money.	No
22264	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	No
13020	What I'm trying to say is that the tide of history is on our side, and we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	No
26204	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	No
12828	First of all, we must have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	No
6575	He is also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	Yes
8616	As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	No
30053	And we hope that by the year we can repel ISIS from Iraq and then, you know, really press them in Syria.	No
23431	It's good for small businesses, good for homeowners.	No
21010	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	No
7820	On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.	Yes
5515	Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	No
19413	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all these things were very important.	Yes
16804	And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.	Yes
25033	There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	Yes
16993	And now is the time for the government to understand and cooperate with our people.	No
20090	President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he was going to fulfill his mandate, but he did not.	Yes
4244	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	No
1344	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	No
23852	I worked hard to create good jobs and educate people.	No
14704	I would like to say, since this is the last time I will be on a platform with my opponents, that although I do not agree with Mr Perot on how quickly we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he has done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	No
28880	It will be a world of peace because we are going to have a clear vision of foreign policy based on a strong army and a mission that stands with our friends.	No
19997	I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.	Yes
698	So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	No
15538	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	No
8451	In my opinion, you can do these programs - and they should be carefully defined - in a balanced budget if our economy moves forward.	No
15785	But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	No
15895	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child remained alive for six months and died.	No
21329	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	No
32512	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	Yes
31979	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	No
13869	So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.	No
15280	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	Yes
8784	But I think this is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the All-Volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	Yes
29784	We cannot just say law and order.	No
32479	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	No
6866	Whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs more in the United States.	Yes
30046	I think there are a number of issues that we should address.	No
8529	I agree with Senator Kennedy's general opinion in this regard.	No
1473	He vetoed the bills passed by Congress as part of the Congressional budget guidelines for two million Americans.	Yes
18593	It's not a way to treat someone who's brave and brave, it's to try to move their country forward.	No
13878	That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	No
16377	But I do not think that we can be satisfied when we spend only $150 billion a year on interest on the national debt, largely for foreign bankers; or when 25% of our high school students drop out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, one third of them veterans, who are homeless and live on the streets and doors of this country, when Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax gift for the rich.	Yes
29669	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	No
8390	Secondly, I support federal support for education and federal support for teachers' salaries.	No
29499	And we better be awfully careful.	No
14179	But I was wrong because I thought that the tax compromise, with an increase in democratic tax, would help the economy.	Yes
24242	Give me a chance to do this.	No
1426	We saw an 18 per cent increase in start-ups.	Yes
21875	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	No
4162	So let me get this right.	No
21473	But that's what I feel.	No
20823	Young people say I'm going to do something good for my country.	No
1378	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	Yes
18800	We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.	Yes
28991	There was a chance to get this done.	No
7682	Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	No
19699	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	No
233	I think we both support them and I would lead strongly in this area as I did in my State as governor.	No
15463	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	Yes
29556	For 40 years, all those who come to the presidency have published their tax returns.	Yes
26604	It's something you might consider.	No
27630	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	No
20801	He decides who the right people are.	No
33831	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	Yes
22199	So this is what our program is all about.	No
24768	So we don't have the best.	No
588	And now we're back, because we've strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us back at that time.	No
20993	On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	No
662	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	No
16334	His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.	Yes
25309	I am in favour of reform in this area, for rigorous enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of Bill Simpson-Mazzoli, but I have struggled for a just nation all my life.	No
28959	But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	Yes
14495	The people need to take their government back.	No
14413	Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a regular current.	No
29942	And the child's lie was very hurtful.	No
19864	And let me say that the budget you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 children from Headstart.	Yes
29275	Then I'll tell you that.	No
34444	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	No
18184	I believe in America's protection first.	No
32511	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	No
17904	When we put an end to 400,000 desperate, desperate and defenceless Americans who were in a state of incapacity -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and we just threw them on the street, as we did for four years, I don't think that's America's problem.	Yes
7794	This goes to our survival.	No
14183	I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	No
19101	Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	No
19701	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	Yes
3902	The question is, was it wise?	No
24804	They didn't tell you that in the same year, they increased spending by $1.83 for every dollar that we increased taxes.	Yes
25426	"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"	No
20019	And I hope in the next segment, you could put this down to rest.	No
8128	I've seen cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took part of their school lunch to feed their families because I don't think we are meeting our obligations to these Americans.	No
14813	Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	No
21639	But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	Yes
25586	But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	No
12639	I've seen us ignore Africa.	No
19821	I'm not an extremist here.	No
20561	A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	No
10867	Senator Obama has opposed that.	Yes
32654	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	No
17975	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	No
28466	When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.	No
28772	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	No
20067	And I will speak on the economic package.	No
7998	And we should try to solve the problem.	No
17421	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene on the most private and personal issues in American life.	No
6758	I think the marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
26309	He won't tell you because he can't.	No
17765	Who will you increase taxes to?	No
12628	Do people want to be identified with us?	No
12757	And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	No
33787	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	Yes
17873	I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.	Yes
23870	Mine is rooted in the real life of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	No
6930	It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.	Yes
30040	The security aspect of cyber is very, very difficult.	No
14819	I'm a father of a son, I have a grandson.	No
23911	Maybe, but I don't think it's fair.	No
19864	And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	Yes
8200	The same applies to motorways.	Yes
25448	But that there would be an answer in our life is unimaginable.	No
16018	Maintain confidence with older men and women in this country.	No
7597	Nor is there any question, but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - will be supported and will reach their freedom.	No
8748	Of course, there are things that we can do in the renovation, in the renovation of our houses, not only of our houses, but also of our commercial structures, which will allow us to realize.	No
18560	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	Yes
11082	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	No
12975	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	No
11469	The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.	No
25219	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.	Yes
16123	The fact is that when we look at the future of this nation, we have two very different visions of this future.	No
11111	What I said was that we will encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our non-military aid to Pakistan so that they have a greater interest in working with us, but insist that they pursue these activists.	Yes
7784	This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	No
27166	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	No
3961	Now, you don't do that.	No
33223	But we're going to do it in a way that's trying to save some of the 33,000 lives we lose every year.	Yes
22183	We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	No
15709	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	No
25592	As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.	No
16630	When you came to Washington to try - as governor - to try to start a new program for your people, like the treatment of drug addicts, I found that there were thirteen different federal agencies I had to go to, to run the drug treatment program.	Yes
25600	Since we debated two weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built an additional 100 warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	Yes
14534	Term limits for members of the US Congress.	No
7061	I see it as a serious problem.	No
28793	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	No
15391	If I were president, I would now like to look at the hundreds of federal regulations that discriminate against women and move forward as everyone seeks an amendment.	No
18880	I don't intend to fade.	No
25199	So why should we believe that they had placed much more dependence on land?	No
34276	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	No
32723	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	No
26963	Governor Romney, I am glad that you recognize that Al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago, when you were asked about the greatest geopolitical threat to America, you said Russia, not Al-Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they are now calling to ask for their foreign policy because, you know, the cold war has been over for 20 years.	Yes
15370	But when I quoted a democratic president, as the president says, I was a democrat.	No
28878	It will therefore be a modern health insurance system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	No
27580	I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	Yes
20994	I had the opportunity to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis after the Mexican peso collapsed.	No
663	And I think we have huge opportunities for trade.	No
1569	There's still a lot to do.	No
26170	The president has been AWOL for four years.	No
25585	I think we need to be strong, and I'm gonna keep us strong.	No
23772	We've lived a lot together as a country -- a recession, corporate scandals, war.	No
16336	And yet this man, the governor, has assimilated the president to a rotten fish.	No
20205	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	No
13204	I completely sustained the treaty.	Yes
768	But the point is sometimes the action-	No
14683	"I really can't believe that Mr Bush is still trying to trust a problem after ""reading my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and accepting what he called the voodoo economy and adopting a program to improve exports for the farmers he threatened with veto and taking a tour of the country by giving money in programs he had opposed."	Yes
34364	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	No
17654	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale spoke about education and students and help of this kind.	No
16894	There's a question about their morality.	No
540	The fact is that education spending is on the rise by the federal government; it is on the rise.	Yes
1141	It is tragic that the full transcript of this interview was not published and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	No
28683	Laura and I are proud of teenage parents, twin girls, and I know what you're saying.	No
18876	But what I will not do is change my fundamental values because of politics or pressure.	No
24588	But I think you have to make an appeal every time you can eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I will continue to do so and point to a legislative achievement to support it.	No
29584	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	No
21806	Let's start with a premise.	No
25137	The most recent one was Brighton's.	No
29599	It's not a lot of money compared to what I had.	No
8034	And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, at the beginning of the year that k-Korea war began, indicating that South Korea was beyond the US defence zone.	Yes
6793	That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	No
19902	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	No
11531	But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	No
2439	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	No
21263	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	No
24059	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	No
2582	This statement also states that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness at the discretion of our choice.	No
22755	But it is a global conflict that requires a firm resolution.	No
28747	Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	No
10223	A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.	Yes
29871	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	No
3850	But it's the Senate inside baseball.	No
20805	Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	No
9812	It's increased by $2,500 a year.	Yes
11294	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	No
28142	The governor talked about Medicare.	No
2576	The government's role is to promote and protect the principles of these documents.	No
16808	And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.	Yes
24169	This administration may say that they have a plan, but the truth is that they have not even released all the money, the insignificant sum of money, that Congress has appropriated.	Yes
25775	They were presidents at the time of history.	No
10445	We've got to make sure that works properly.	No
28874	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	No
21594	Like Mr. Perot, I'm worried about deficits and $150 billion, it's a lot of money, but it's hard to say that we're going to spend more money when we try to reduce the deficit.	No
18823	And fortunately, the rainy season will soon end, which will make it easier to get help there and help people who have been suffering from it for a long time.	No
2571	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	No
11119	Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.	No
8609	In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.	Yes
16652	But over the past twenty-four months, we have turned the economy and reduced inflation to less than six percent, and we have reduced the employment rate by about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the country's history.	Yes
30390	And this country cannot afford to have another four years of this kind of experience.	No
32380	The border patrol officers, 16,500, just approved me, and they approved me because I understand the border.	Yes
22243	Overall, it should be local -- the more local, the better.	No
21952	Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	No
29443	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	Yes
5494	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	No
20109	I think they are better, all of us, than we have lowered interest rates and the deficit.	Yes
13501	Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	Yes
31871	Today, police officers were killed.	Yes
29165	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	No
7040	People need to remember: Six months before I arrived, the stock market started to fall.	Yes
19635	When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.	Yes
5574	We're not going to do that in my administration.	No
17882	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	No
191	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	No
13999	He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	Yes
8034	And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.	Yes
15657	What was he referring to?	No
1427	We have seen a substantial increase in new housing permits.	Yes
21761	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	No
235	Well, we're on the right track.	No
3189	The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries around the world.	No
4249	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	No
16732	And whenever automobile manufacturers come forward and say that they can't meet the amendments that Congress has introduced, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	Yes
193	So I think we should do it in the Medicaid system.	No
14859	In the past, we did not have an adequate military presence in this area.	No
33782	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	Yes
24107	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	No
8767	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	Yes
17534	It's been a big failure.	No
1413	Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.	Yes
30316	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	No
2043	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	No
34102	I have no illusions about that.	No
15356	The most important difference in this electoral campaign, in my view, is the approach to nuclear weapons control and the tendency to control or not control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that do not currently have it, particularly the terrorist nations.	No
2480	They are small businesses that compete with each other and learn how to make better and better jobs.	No
14924	When Mr. Carter became president, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	Yes
23839	I'll talk about it a little later, but the changes are upsetting for world peace.	No
26292	The president wants to spend 20 percent more over the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and return that 6% to the population.	Yes
27143	The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	No
8747	I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	Yes
23426	That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	No
7641	We lost three thousand American lives.	Yes
25846	Jason, I really appreciate being a former soldier myself.	No
21598	Everyone's running against the owner.	No
8821	I must say that I think I have a better opportunity, however, to find the necessary funds to pay what, it is true, will be very, very substantial sums.	No
124	I will say this -	No
6021	Due to previous agreements, their goods and products enter our country free of charge.	Yes
116	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	Yes
24101	Your question was about fairness.	No
19746	I think we have lost credibility, and I say it very honestly without bias.	No
27080	We have to make sure they don't have the arms that enter the... the wrong hands.	No
9935	Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	Yes
32667	And you know what's going on?	No
23105	And you will find a plan to reform criminal liability.	No
5663	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting against an agreement for a few years, as you may recall, it was a deal between an aircraft manufacturer, the DOD, and people ended up in jail.	Yes
20833	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	No
20267	I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	Yes
17792	So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.	No
32398	It was a principle, and it was strategic.	No
23056	"""I think that makes sense."	No
34061	There was even a time when he didn't have an Emmy for his three-year TV show in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were faked against him.	Yes
21458	It's so heavy they give you a broken back.	No
8847	for a specific cause or purpose, come with such bureaucracy, such priorities set by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the hands of the local administration are linked in terms of the use of that money they believe they can best use, and for what they think is the top priority.	No
10829	There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	No
12271	But it begins with working with states and local populations.	Yes
24681	They never saw anything happen in this town.	No
17396	We note that schools extend the curriculum to compulsory mathematics and science education, and so on.	Yes
15121	Finally, do not deal with the PLO until the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as the basis for peace in the Middle East.	No
5588	The fact is that today's U.S. companies pay the second highest tax rate in the world.	Yes
6114	And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	No
11671	I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	No
16466	We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.	No
7006	We heard the same thing.	No
21846	A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.	No
13143	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	No
11649	But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	No
19140	We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
16518	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	No
8285	We presented a student program for the Congo of more than three hundred that was more than the federal government had for the whole of Africa the previous year, so I do not think that we have at least moved in these two areas with sufficient vigour.	Yes
33870	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	Yes
22500	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	No
34404	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	No
18400	It's hard to go from a place where people cut their hands, or are executed, to a place where people are free.	No
8237	Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	No
19299	You also offer opportunity grants so that low-income parents have the same choice as others when sending their children to better schools.	No
30265	As far as nuclear power is concerned, I agree.	No
4271	And drilling at sea is also very important and it's a bridge.	No
6535	Across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans don't have health insurance, 114,000 of them lost under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost under President Bush.	Yes
26085	One is in technical school, the other is an honorary student in high school.	No
12032	like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	No
10251	The rate of regulation quadrupled under this president.	Yes
27975	And there are two very different paths that the country can take.	No
32237	I'll tell you what that means.	No
21510	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	No
29231	And he's a big mailman.	No
25847	You know, we have 17,000 men and women wearing our uniform today who receive food stamps.	Yes
16479	In my January budget to Congress this year, I recommended a 50 per cent reduction in the growth rate of federal spending.	Yes
2005	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
1035	Let us set out some guidelines so that we do not have a continuation of inflation.	No
24038	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can make you defend me, it's good.	No
33	And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	No
19235	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	Yes
12251	We are a great industrial state.	Yes
1935	One, of course, is to increase taxes.	No
12940	You have not shown the recognition of the Administration's program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	Yes
21076	Social security never did that.	Yes
20001	But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	No
2176	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	No
8200	The same is true of highways.	Yes
8574	Although they have grown faster than we have, we see, for example, today, that their total gross national product accounts for only 44 per cent of our total gross national product.	Yes
19434	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	Yes
1843	Now Governor Romney and I share a deep interest in encouraging the growth of small businesses.	No
10185	We are beginning to see gains in mathematics and science.	Yes
15604	I would like him to join me, in fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the veto.	No
32862	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	No
926	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	No
22029	Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	No
3704	Senator Obama has the most Liberal record in the United States Senate.	Yes
5653	We presided over the largest increase in government since the Grand Society.	Yes
4022	"Then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing: you will do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death is not in vain."""	No
6312	I don't think young Americans are interest groups, I think they are our future.	No
1743	At the same time, gas prices doubled under the presidency.	Yes
1663	Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.	Yes
20173	I'm asking for your support, I'm asking for your help.	No
22935	It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	No
11559	It is important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help maintain peace in Europe.	No
27137	That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	No
16580	We have a - a clear distinction between white collar crime - the - the - big blows that are rich, that are influential, very rarely go to prison; those who are poor and - and who have no influence - very often are those who are punished.	No
32235	You're gonna have plans...	No
2290	Let me give you an example.	No
32015	So you really owe him an apology.	No
33639	But we have horrible things.	No
16764	In addition, jobs would not be available at this time.	Yes
11759	It must be available for emergency situations.	No
573	I want to be the commander-in-chief of this country.	No
3941	And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is that we do not have the troops at the moment to deal with Afghanistan.	No
29586	It was more than a mistake.	No
1401	He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.	Yes
19683	Saddam Hussein is subject to a UN resolution not to threaten his neighbours or to threaten his own citizens, to suppress his own citizens.	Yes
2459	But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	No
13234	We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.	No
22811	"I remember going down to the White House basement the day we hired our troops as a last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right level of troops?"""	No
11878	Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	No
2000	If you want to make some adjustments, take it, go to Congress, fight it.	No
21171	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	No
30247	It's not an accurate one.	No
23188	We have a deficit because this country has experienced a recession.	Yes
1873	But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.	Yes
20350	Under my plan, the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	No
25387	And any research or development along Star Wars systems would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	No
6462	The measure is: Are we as sure as we should be?	No
1512	Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	No
20125	In addition, the Republican Congress reduced $53 billion.	Yes
33639	But we have horrible deals.	No
11079	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	No
21620	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	No
7721	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	Yes
24351	I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	No
8611	The means are at question.	No
26191	The last budget he led cut the Pell grants, cut the student loans.	Yes
23353	We're spending $1 billion to find the technology we need.	Yes
1817	But that -- that is not the case.	No
18961	I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	No
1577	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	Yes
24560	We turned him into a weakness.	No
1763	But not due to his policies.	No
26038	"I knew it wouldn't work."""	No
1912	Number two, let's look at the story.	No
32153	I think Donald was about to say that he's gonna solve this by repealing this and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	No
7664	Not because I'm preaching to the people of the South because it's not just a problem in the South; it's a problem in the North and a problem in the West; it's a problem for all of us.	No
16455	Well - we now have such a uh - low utilization of our production capacity - about 73 percent; I think it's pretty low since the years of the Great Depression - and a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go to get people to work before we have inflationary pressures.	Yes
345	I see an involvement of a thousand points of light.	No
20898	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the law to start in the state of Texas.	Yes
16650	Well, over the past two years, as I have already said, we have had a very difficult time.	No
19411	We have considerably strengthened border control and enforcement.	Yes
3498	But there's also the issue of responsibility.	No
8424	We both took it, and I'm taking it now, for this reason: we want higher salaries for teachers.	No
24099	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	Yes
3941	And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.	No
10686	When JFK said we were going to the moon in 10 years, no one was sure how to do it, but we understood that if the American people make a decision to do something, it's done.	No
20237	I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	No
23838	I think we've radically changed the world.	No
22108	I hope they think it's good that democracy and freedom are on the move.	No
6265	Our education system must therefore be correct.	No
13323	I would simply say before that that I believe that in this area the laws that should be adopted, with regard to the major national emergency strikes, are those that will give the President more weapons to deal with these strikes.	No
3879	And this strategy, and this general, they win.	No
22858	He was cheating on the detectives.	Yes
21788	If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	No
29850	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	No
34147	And do you know who will be the beneficiary?	No
11871	She said, reading is the new civil right.	No
13722	It's a pretty rural state.	No
17589	And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	Yes
9022	But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.	No
15812	Probably never heard of him.	No
14231	We can't get anything done.	No
26710	It's public ethics, I'm not talking about private ethics.	No
9741	In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	No
19167	But I think we are right when we try, for example, to give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be expelled from the hospital, putting an end to these deliveries by car.	No
16805	This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	Yes
5564	You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	No
6622	They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	No
23512	We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	No
7990	Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	Yes
32611	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	No
16821	Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
786	You're judging the case.	No
262	It is a certain passion that, in my opinion, it is a misguided passion.	No
25	We have to change this whole culture.	No
32446	Soros, who is one of her friends, has taken a huge deduction.	Yes
27532	And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	No
22434	If the Americans want to do it and not talk about it, then they should -- you know, I'm a person they should consider.	No
1476	This is a very serious indictment of this administration.	No
21340	It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have increased and our trade deficit has decreased; it is also true that today, a record trade deficit has been announced with Japan.	Yes
2226	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	No
14193	101 in leadership is responsible for what you do.	No
29058	I do not think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	No
8068	It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	No
25774	You talked about Washington and Lincoln.	No
30212	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	Yes
27929	I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	No
16910	I think the American people want a Republican president to check the excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a democratic Congress.	No
23973	We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	No
2032	Well, we've had this discussion before.	No
7677	Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not complete high school.	Yes
14479	I'm telling both political parties.	No
8721	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	No
7708	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	No
21782	I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	No
18707	My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	No
22431	Thank you very, very much.	No
16055	And I think the vice-president supported the Bork nomination.	No
15402	So my legacy as a Southerner, my experience at the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a good way forward.	No
20300	There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	No
25754	If you think that the Republican party is a place for you to come if you're close-minded or fanatical or don't like some people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to get out of what I'm here without compromise, because it's Lincoln's party.	No
17910	It's not fair for our future.	No
1712	We have a program called Race to the Top that has led to reforms in 46 states across the country, increasing standards, improving the way we train teachers.	Yes
13668	But look what's happened to the middle class.	No
28451	That's what a leader does.	No
16780	These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.	No
14845	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	No
15569	I made a commitment to do it.	No
5999	In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.	No
31928	Like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we've heard and seen.	No
16454	Yes, in the case of unemployment which may create additional pressure on prices, what is your willingness to consider an income policy, i.e. wage and price control?	No
20102	I said that our economic plan would create eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	Yes
20255	That's not what I think.	No
116	We should be able to develop an agricultural policy in that country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which we did under that administration.	Yes
29356	Secretary, you don't have a plan.	No
28662	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of detail in your plan, Mr. Vice-President, with all due respect.	No
19702	We even ship 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
16902	We will make gains in the United States Senate.	No
9482	I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	No
33389	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	No
784	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	No
22020	That's what the election's about.	No
12316	I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	Yes
16590	We have eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight.	Yes
11520	I think, you know, I hope I can convince people that I could better manage the Iraqi situation.	No
7435	But Washington is a tough town.	No
8885	It will come from the pockets of people who live in these very areas.	No
10686	Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	No
9936	In her first year, I was getting... licked after being beaten by John McCain, okay.	No
17684	The other thing is that we need the business community and government heavily involved in these communities to try to achieve economic growth.	No
14564	Now, I'll tell ya this.	No
12740	We have moved to Latin America very effectively, and I would also like to point out: Senator Kennedy is very well complaining about our inadequate radio programmes in Latin America.	No
18431	We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.	Yes
33983	...the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and veterinarians with disabilities.	Yes
21364	So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	No
33198	You talked about the Heller decision.	No
1112	Mr Harriman has spoken to the Yugoslav leaders, and I think it is right to say that there is no prospect, in their opinion, that the Soviet Union will invade Yugoslavia, that Mr Tito will have died.	No
29299	Are they going to create jobs in America?	No
1599	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a certain degree of unity, if we can set our goals sufficiently high and work on recognized goals with industry, work and agriculture with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	No
1325	I am in favour of the particular constitutional amendment which would give individual states the right to vote in these states, the possibility of taking a decision by public referendum.	No
32989	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	No
24814	And the biggest refund I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	No
12991	More progress over the past eight years than in the previous eighty years.	Yes
13448	Particularly some of the smaller producers.	No
21365	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	Yes
29022	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the 1960s, since the Vietnam War, from Watergate, and because we need a reform of campaign financing.	No
15240	I think as technology improves, we can do even better with that.	No
34340	And people, Chris, will go back to work and make a lot of money.	No
22296	I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	No
28443	Israel is our friend and we will stay close to Israel.	No
28469	In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
265	"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	No
359	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you have reduced our commitment to affordable housing for low-income and moderate-income families by 90 percent.	Yes
19748	Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	No
25260	And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	Yes
32449	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is complete, I will publish my returns.	No
32518	We have to make up for lost time, because I want to invest in you.	No
13664	Now, should people pay more for health insurance if they can?	No
29952	It doesn't work like that.	No
10624	And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	No
4031	She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.	No
11335	Wages and incomes have fallen.	Yes
22132	We've got agreements, but they are still there.	No
18735	He wants to dismantle the six-party talks, or the five-nation coalition that sends him a clear message.	No
29105	This means that we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	No
25218	And we know what happened.	No
23742	Thank you all for participating.	No
12727	The people must make a choice between Mr Nixon and me, between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, between our approach to the problems that disturb us today as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	No
27858	Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.	No
7669	Mr. Nixon did not discuss the two fundamental issues: what will be done and what will be his policy on the implementation of the 1954 Supreme Court decision?	No
18984	Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	No
17767	Are you going to pursue social security and health insurance, student assistance and the disabled again as you did last time?	No
7677	Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.	Yes
4279	I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	Yes
28221	I have sometimes believed that strong responsibility encourages parental participation.	No
22593	He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.	Yes
2174	I want to take $716 billion that you cut and handed it over to medicare.	Yes
7149	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	No
20636	And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	No
23593	I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	No
11725	That's what it means.	No
24940	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will deal with this situation then, and they will be removed.	No
14094	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	No
27072	It's their way to the sea.	No
12941	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw from these islands.	Yes
15251	To repeat, this year we have the opportunity, which we are going to achieve, to produce 800 million tonnes of coal - an unprecedented record in the history of our country.	No
22113	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	Yes
19948	Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	Yes
33891	That is not who America is.	No
18034	And I'm going to hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	No
28119	I believe that price control would prevent us from pursuing important research and development.	No
33702	They're growing at 8 percent.	Yes
20165	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	No
14840	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there is a simple answer.	No
10763	There have been five or six and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	No
2086	... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	No
11688	And as a result of our great victory during the Second World War, we gave the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	Yes
16807	It shows a lack of leadership.	No
17171	Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	No
107	First, I suggested that there are certain weapons systems that we do not need and that we cannot afford.	No
19419	I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	No
3681	We do not yet know what our tax revenues will be.	No
25284	I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.	No
18041	Unfortunately, he escaped to the mountains of Tora Bora.	Yes
19037	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	No
17588	Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	Yes
25940	My record back to 1965 in Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little opinion on cigarettes.	Yes
4280	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	No
7985	Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	No
24333	Our exports are dramatically up.	Yes
33944	I was in a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	No
19715	The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	Yes
4163	"We sit with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel from the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	No
12262	I think we need clean coal technologies.	No
33750	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	Yes
25874	We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.	No
13844	When our government asked me to do the POW project, in less than a year, the Vietnamese had sent people to Canada to make arrangements for my family and myself to be killed.	Yes
23175	Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	Yes
21164	You may want to focus on the scandal.	No
18832	Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	No
16923	I think it's a good balance.	No
3559	He called for $932 million in pork barrel spending, almost $1 million for every day he was in the United States Senate.	Yes
5848	You know, here's what I would say.	No
19744	It's ad hoc, we get up in the morning and read the papers, which country has problems, we'll have a meeting.	No
27754	How strong is our economy?	No
1704	Now I'm worried that the path we're on has just been unsuccessful.	No
28302	Look, we're in an information age.	No
3789	I objected to the President on spending, climate change, torture of prisoners, Guantanamo Bay.	Yes
15816	He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	Yes
4090	Now here's what we need to do.	No
30274	I looked the other night.	No
8499	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	No
2201	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I like that term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is that these seniors right away will pay another $600 in prescription care."	Yes
26524	It's not a government takeover.	No
12822	I think the next president, immediately after his election, should sit down with the president, set a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January next year.	No
34176	But we have to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	No
3259	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	No
15401	It is part of my conscience and commitment to continue this progress.	No
22047	That's because it's from you, not you.	No
613	We're going to have to-the MX.	No
17390	I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	No
17199	And, by the way, I could say that with respect to the 25 per cent reduction in social security -- before arriving at the answer to your question -- the only 25 per cent reduction that I know was with this huge increase in the 1977 tax was a 25 per cent reduction in benefits for all Americans born after 1916.	Yes
13020	What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	No
25168	"But we're not just gonna kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we even have."""	No
25032	And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.	Yes
19527	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	Yes
23171	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	No
25884	He cut $112 billion, so we're about to make it.	Yes
19269	People need it, that's it.	No
18989	Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	No
2891	I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	No
9509	I want to revive the American economy.	No
15798	Drug counsellors, on the street, who help young people who come to me and others who ask for help and who want help, do the hard work, the heroic work that it takes to provide this kind of leadership, this kind of advice, this kind of support.	No
2700	That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	No
6340	It is a system that requires accountability, transparency and adequate funding.	No
24480	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in each home.	No
11939	And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.	No
21450	I spend my money -- not CAP money, not foreign money, my money -- to convey this message to the people.	Yes
11640	And this is a case in which we must use our influence to bring the African countries together and help to deal with the situation.	No
3186	United States foreign policy meets the highest moral standards.	No
15702	If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	No
3173	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	Yes
22884	We're not going to have a draft, period.	No
4041	I think that's something we need to take seriously.	No
20035	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	No
4100	This is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, eliminating Israel from the map, and we will sit, without preconditions, through the table, to legitimize and give a platform of propaganda to a person who marries the extermination of the State of Israel, and therefore give them more credibility in the world arena and therefore to say, they have probably done the right thing, because you will sit on the other side of the table and who will legitimize their illegal behavior.	Yes
19350	That's why I'm contacting Perot's voters.	No
29732	And we must be very strong.	No
11871	She said, reading is the new civil law.	No
16924	But the fact is that - a president should lead this country.	No
2240	And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.	No
3763	There's no doubt itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna affect our budgets.	No
16803	There were only net savings of $4 billion.	Yes
24999	And I made it plain to them, we're not.	No
26943	That's not the right course for us.	No
24717	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	No
27481	And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	No
33251	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	No
2528	That's one way to do it.	No
22040	To lower interest rates.	No
1462	There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	No
12122	I have been responsible for this government rationalization project, which has reduced the size of the government by more than 300,000 people in recent years.	Yes
17277	And I think I sang at more weddings and funerals than anyone else to seek the presidency.	No
32084	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	Yes
25293	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	No
15258	That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	No
32308	So he would have been alive today.	No
22419	I don't want to raise taxes.	No
8854	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	Yes
24039	But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	No
20110	The Republicans are talking about it, but we are the first administration in life to examine this program to reduce this deficit four years in a row.	Yes
28886	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	No
26210	And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	No
3371	We should be a beacon for nations seeking peace and freedom, seeking individual freedom, seeking fundamental human rights.	No
11401	Having a free and peaceful hemisphere is in the interests of our nation.	No
17486	Now, the example cited by the President has nothing to do with abortion.	No
26458	I could answer a lot of these things.	No
19580	There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.	Yes
20206	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	No
27410	And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	No
32333	First of all, I will not allow anyone to enter our country, which, in my opinion, poses a risk to us.	No
6264	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything, and that means that it also has an impact on national security, because there has never been a nation on earth that has seen its economy decline and has continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	No
7422	I think we need to get together and work to change it.	No
9072	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	No
12513	I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	No
5721	First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.	Yes
15520	We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	No
26581	It's going to help everything.	No
8531	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	No
15020	Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	Yes
32045	I told people that it would be impossible to verify the facts all the time Donald.	No
25210	I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	No
14743	For the millions of good-quality people who have done the unthinkable and taken their country back into their hands and put me to the vote, let me promise you that tonight is just the beginning.	No
25421	This administration, entering the Star Wars system, will add another dangerous escalation.	No
32440	But I don't have any loans with Russia.	Yes
24335	I mean, that's been done.	Yes
24647	More than 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	Yes
27123	This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	No
21797	And after the reform, it will not be a career opportunity for life; good people will serve, then return home and do not become foreign lobbyists and liquidate at $30,000 a month, then take leave to run a president's campaign.	No
12573	First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
10315	That's why we need to make sure we have the best science and research in the world.	No
10082	It wasn't a spontaneous demonstration, was it?	No
1876	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	No
25148	"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	Yes
29665	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	No
9453	But your rate is dropping and the burden is also on you for one more reason, and it is any middle-income taxpayer who will no longer pay tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	Yes
16800	And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	Yes
33554	We spend a fortune doing it.	No
21415	In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	Yes
3700	We need to eliminate programs that do not work, and we need to ensure that the programs we have are more effective and cost less.	No
6935	They have poor-quality health care.	No
12562	And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	No
23292	You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.	Yes
846	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	No
27179	Our army is the second in the world.	Yes
6290	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops for teachers where people, after serving in the army, can go straight to education and not have to pass those exams that - or have the certification that some are required in some states.	No
24140	Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.	No
25821	So let's stop talking about cutting off health insurance.	No
580	And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	Yes
23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	No
24287	We've got to make things here.	No
26202	Their idea is to increase taxes and spend more money.	No
29305	But let us not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	No
28829	Mel Carnahan, in Missouri, had the best record of diversity in any governor in the history of the state of Missouri.	Yes
29930	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	No
1040	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	No
20827	Unfortunately, that's how some children are marked.	No
28760	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and throwing blame and saying one thing and doing another.	No
23217	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	No
15152	Moreover, it is illegal, because the law of the country, adopted by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	Yes
25406	Maybe it's an oil fire, an exhaust jet, the computer could decide it's a missile -- and we're leaving.	No
24307	Number two, we have to deal with this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this very high priority.	No
883	You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.	No
20963	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	No
1006	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	No
19657	The president detained him.	Yes
13497	We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	No
18084	Actually, my opponent's talking about detectives.	No
33427	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	Yes
10220	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	Yes
29117	How are we going to do it?	No
26500	Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	Yes
9071	I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	No
22490	You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	No
3986	And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	No
11553	And I know that there are some in our party who disagree with that feeling.	No
15554	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	Yes
12542	Because once again it has shown a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding especially of communists, because every time you make such a concession, it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	No
2088	First, the Department of Energy stated that the tax relief for oil companies is $2.8 billion per year.	Yes
23916	Well, let's admit it then.	No
16109	That is absolutely not true.	No
18629	I was hoping diplomacy would work in Iraq.	No
2489	Let me first point out that this advice we are talking about cannot make a decision on the treatments that are given.	Yes
14876	But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	No
21593	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	No
29693	Everyone must be respected by the law, and everyone must respect the law.	No
23228	This is the first time that the United States of America has suffered a tax cut when we are at war.	Yes
15177	And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	Yes
22365	I think you'll see more minority candidates and candidates running.	No
4173	We do this all the time.	No
15006	But I think we're all together, and I think the presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said.	No
1431	The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	Yes
2051	If -- if we are serious, we must take a balanced and responsible approach.	No
23979	Let me... I have to correct one thing.	No
16111	That is absolutely not true.	No
23782	The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.	Yes
13915	I understand the creation of jobs.	No
538	This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	No
27928	I met a young woman in Philadelphia coming out of college, who can't find a job.	Yes
18313	General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	Yes
15378	I do not think that this can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women's equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	No
12727	The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	No
6319	I am sure that you are aware, Senator Obama, of the program of the Washington School System, D.C., where the vouchers are provided and there are a number, I think it is a thousand and a few and some 9,000 parents have applied to be eligible for this.	Yes
19558	We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	No
28310	We need to start treating teachers like the professionals they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will attract more people into teaching because we need much more teachers.	No
22984	It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	Yes
3615	But, again, I want to return.	No
9718	My path is designed to get small businesses to grow and hire people.	No
25387	And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	No
2954	And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	No
13449	They move about eight or nine days to Texas.	Yes
18593	That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	No
22240	Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	Yes
8879	In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	No
11055	And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.	Yes
30052	Our army is helping Iraq.	Yes
30194	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	No
28494	And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	Yes
3319	It's a matter of morality.	No
17978	All this, and especially internal security, we'll talk about a little later.	No
12066	But there seems to be a lot of concern about - not only in this debate, but only in general on the law.	No
27509	And then the president started what I called a tour of excuses, going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	Yes
15709	So this is not about saying that our budget is full of waste.	No
26658	He's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think he'll come down more.	No
3911	But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	No
15173	But when a man who hopes to be president says, take this treaty, throw it away, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - it is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	No
33598	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	No
19458	We have 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who shouldn't have weapons.	Yes
747	We must treat him as an international crime.	No
28169	I want to give small business employers a 25% tax credit to encourage the provision of health insurance to small business employees.	No
1917	And we're talking about evidence.	No
27586	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	No
21003	I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.	No
17024	It calls for more of the same.	No
15943	And I think that those who advocated freezing did not understand that there was a better way and that there was a better way to achieve asymmetrical reductions in principle.	No
29479	...as I said, I had a hard time.	No
12544	And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	No
33394	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	Yes
5670	I think we have a disagreement about a freeze on spending.	No
25634	They will know how we have solved them, and whether our solution has been beneficial to them over the years, or whether it has harmed them.	No
21455	I think you need to look at it.	No
15929	I therefore hope that we can begin to move these resources.	No
15812	Probably never heard of him.	No
27298	Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	No
29646	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	Yes
7620	In 1955, the Soviet Union expressed its regret about the Bering Sea incident.	Yes
27613	You can't -- but you can't have the president just expose a whole series of things without giving me a chance to answer.	No
8195	We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	Yes
12020	He's for weapons registration.	Yes
15443	I am sorry that we were unable to persuade the third candidate to arrive, so that he could also be seen in these debates.	No
11710	But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	No
18076	I didn't need anyone to tell me to go to the United Nations.	No
26342	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	No
25462	And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	Yes
29431	They're going to develop their businesses.	No
31864	We had an $800 billion deficit.	Yes
18884	He had to be disarmed.	No
27375	I had the chance to be governor of a state.	No
8351	All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	No
32743	How -- why would these people stay there?	No
18927	We convinced Libya to disarm.	Yes
2894	What we once were so proud of - the strength of our country, its moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution represents, has disappeared.	No
26674	"When you give us access, we will give you access."""	No
17216	Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	No
3914	But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	No
926	I would oppose it, but I think it was on the right track in agriculture and I am very encouraged.	No
21459	And all that's in there says what I'm for.	No
7895	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	No
1008	I don't think America can spend a lot of money with many new programs, which would add a lot to the federal budget.	No
26066	It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	No
869	I've chosen a lot of people.	No
19404	But let's look at the overall balance sheet.	No
18575	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	Yes
10363	The president said he would.	No
389	But governors are ready; mayors are ready.	No
16504	In December 1975, he vetoed the draft tax reduction bill of approximately $18 billion to $20 billion that had been passed by Congress, then returned later in January of this year and advocated a tax reduction of $10 billion, but it would be offset by an increase of $6 billion in deductions for social security benefits and unemployment benefits in January of this year.	Yes
14339	-- and Glaspie's papers were presented in the U.S. Senate.	Yes
15211	We have thousands, the equivalent of megatons, or millions of tons, of TNT warheads.	Yes
22143	When we came out of World War II, it made sense.	No
24761	He has not managed to deal with anyone else -- the misappropriation of people, those who bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous lawsuits of lawyers who manage the costs of medical care up to $25 to $50 billion.	Yes
19473	And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	No
15121	And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.	No
16809	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	Yes
33148	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	No
8834	We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	No
29372	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	No
12908	He repeated this mistake in 1959, in his speech.	Yes
28800	But policies that give people help so they can help themselves.	No
17720	I'm going to grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate about why -- energy prices, etc.	No
23571	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	No
24516	Again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because it is permanently and genetically damaged.	No
24710	I have a difference with Mr Perot on this because I do not think that social security should be affected.	No
14346	I'd like to see these instructions in writing.	No
21551	So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.	No
29960	It was very easy to do.	No
9499	And it is exactly the kind of descending economy that will not work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that strives for everyone.	No
10529	We've got to stop this greed and excess.	No
14809	I don't know what the differences are, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	No
23221	That's how we leave her.	No
15832	Barbara and I were sitting there before this democratic convention.	No
28935	I think it's a deterrent.	No
16546	I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	No
27513	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	No
7435	But Washington is a difficult city.	No
24470	And one way to do that is to make sure these dead fathers pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	No
20892	Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	No
22850	It is very difficult to get other countries to abandon their weapons when you are busy developing a new one.	No
22105	NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.	No
28614	We have to open up the markets.	No
7036	If you are married, you are entitled to tax relief.	Yes
28468	I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.	No
17220	We didn't think about throwing people in the snow, whether it's because of age or need.	No
1412	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court, uh - is changing gradually, and I am glad to see that there are steps taken by the Burger Court to amend the Miranda decision.	Yes
448	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	No
3256	Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	No
16970	So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	No
26627	My primary school best friend is a computer software vendor and he told me the last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	Yes
30198	I know how to win.	No
18717	But I'm not going to make decisions that, in my opinion, are bad for America.	No
5579	... in order to give -- in order to grant additional tax reductions to Joe the plumber before he is at the point where he could earn $250,000.	No
11364	It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	No
26249	I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.	No
13956	I just have a real philosophical difference.	No
26390	We're going to do it with an economic package.	No
32998	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	Yes
10936	We will do this by ensuring that we use information technology to ensure that medical records are actually on computers instead of completing three-fold forms when you go to hospital.	No
8780	Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	Yes
9146	With half of the graduate students this year without a university -- excuse me, without work.	Yes
24759	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	No
24208	He's the first culprit.	No
19356	He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get the campaign funding reform.	Yes
29548	Let her free the e-mails.	No
13647	I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.	No
29831	And it was terminated by the current mayor.	Yes
25078	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	No
15101	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	No
17098	Thus, we believe that, as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, the rate of increase in government spending, from 17 per cent to 6 per cent, and, at the same time, the growth of the economy increases the revenues that the government receives, without increasing taxes, these two lines will be met.	Yes
13384	I don't think we should have that kind of a program.	No
8389	The program that I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have provided medical care for the elderly on social security, and would have been paid for by the social security system and the social security tax.	Yes
15670	And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	No
17150	And in the five years before we took office, taxes doubled in the United States, and budgets increased by $318 billion.	Yes
23135	He's gonna tax everyone here to fund his programs.	No
18294	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	No
312	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	No
14614	I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	No
25900	My position has always been that the work of the United States is to minimize the risk of peace.	No
6469	Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.	Yes
13340	I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	Yes
8459	It failed because the House did not adopt it and the House failed by eleven votes.	Yes
21854	I think medical care should go with the person.	No
682	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.	No
27693	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	No
33548	There are about four minutes between the order given and those responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	Yes
6205	We tried to overthrow him in the Senate.	No
27647	And we are now in a position where we can get out of the transition, because there is no reason for the Americans to die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	Yes
28553	But I also firmly believe that we must enforce the laws on books, that the best way to ensure that we keep our society safe is to hold people accountable for the violation of the law.	No
29954	I don't think you can deny that.	No
22007	But it is -- the full faith and merit of the United States, despite our difficulties, are still quite good.	No
5807	Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	No
28700	I like the idea of having technology for television, easy to use for parents so you can adjust these programs you don't want in your home.	No
23154	It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	No
21444	And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.	No
25165	On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.	No
8068	Maybe it's republican, maybe it's democratic.	No
18271	And I think our troops need other allies.	No
12799	I hope we succeed.	No
7800	Senator Kennedy has placed a great deal of emphasis on the need for economic assistance.	No
33388	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	No
7971	And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	No
11818	But if I are given the presidency, it will be the first civil rights law of the 21st century.	No
19453	It's called automated control or instant control.	No
16590	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	Yes
16177	I've been an outdoor man and a sportsman my whole life.	No
19184	We have the highest external debt in history.	Yes
626	But listen, let me summarize.	No
4037	And it is not true that you have always been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	No
25508	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	Yes
19722	I couldn't send soldiers to northern Iraq, which would have been wrong.	No
25566	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	No
34367	And I think -- you know, it's a difference that affects the way we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	No
25885	But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.	No
14164	I look at this as history.	No
18052	And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	Yes
6590	I pay by changing the relationship with the banks.	No
5872	Forty years ago, when I was eight, he was engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	Yes
25955	You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	No
28616	I want the next president to have quick bargaining power to open markets around the world.	No
24142	Now we can do better.	No
8618	And if we assume our responsibilities, I think freedom will conquer.	No
8504	I do not think this is extreme at all, yet almost two-thirds to three-quarters of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against this proposal.	Yes
28263	I'm a state governor and I don't like the federal government telling us what to do.	No
10158	For what purpose it was set up, I can't imagine.	No
15809	I agree with the Governor on athletics.	No
19369	All 50 states did it.	Yes
7837	I know him very well.	No
28319	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler, but most of this is because of the federal government.	No
12909	He repeated it in a television debate we had.	No
1320	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	No
12630	I don't think they're doing it, enough.	No
22787	Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	No
14815	America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	No
3451	There are also many Americans who face challenges.	No
8604	Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	No
17222	The safety net is there, and we take care of more people than any administration in this country has ever taken care of before.	Yes
18334	My opponent says we had no allies in this war.	Yes
25622	We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	No
29393	... wouldn't add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add five trillion dollars to the debt.	Yes
12781	And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.	No
14569	And the president said that never, never, would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and in one day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, it's not a promise.	Yes
243	And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	No
21238	I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	No
16852	What I want is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	No
24539	We need a hundred thousand more policemen on the street.	No
29439	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	No
16715	We need to move very strongly towards solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	No
1523	They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	No
23566	I really haven't picked anyone yet.	No
13216	I wouldn't give these islands under any gunpoint.	No
22458	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	No
34202	No, you're the one who's unfit.	No
17594	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	No
19674	There may be a way to reach uninsured people, because there are many uninsured people in the country, especially children, who should be covered.	No
29836	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to decline, including murders.	Yes
16569	In September 1974, I gave all the crooks, all the deserters, an opportunity to come voluntarily, to erase their files by obtaining the opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	Yes
18905	Right now, the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the search for nuclear weapons in bunkers.	Yes
32191	We need to get rid of the lines around the state, the artificial lines, where we prevent insurance companies from entering and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and anyone who worked there -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives insurance companies essentially monopolies.	Yes
22450	And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	No
3944	And this is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will recognize that Al-Qaida is the greatest threat to the United States and that the Secretary of Defense has recognized the central front - that the place we have to deal with these people will be in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	Yes
28260	First of all, the vouchers are the responsibility of the States.	No
22183	We have a concept called New American School Corporation where we do exactly that.	No
29272	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
33031	There's something called clean coal.	No
16157	Agricultural payments are falling because the agricultural economy is returning.	Yes
14206	Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	No
27536	And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	No
793	And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	No
15629	I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.	No
25854	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	Yes
8927	So you, dear voters, are on the auction block, and these two candidates are calling for your votes.	No
14127	In 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	No
17481	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	No
7881	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	No
20257	It's a difference of opinion.	No
13298	And that's my view now.	No
24808	I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	No
33022	I think this is such a big question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	Yes
21122	The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	Yes
3822	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	Yes
1320	Personally, I do not believe that the federal government must fund abortions, but I - I draw the line and do not support a constitutional amendment.	No
3173	We have two and a half million more Americans at work now that we had one when Mr. Ford took office.	Yes
2200	Benefits were not affected at all.	Yes
18693	"The words of the President of the United States are good enough for me."""	No
7521	And he said this about it.	No
26771	We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	No
26618	But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.	No
32761	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	No
29055	After setting priorities, I want to return some of your money.	No
12930	The position of the United States was that this accumulation, in the words of the President, was stupid.	No
25523	I went to the Philippines as Vice-President, insisted on human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been blocked on the bases of Subic and Clark.	Yes
9216	But they'll tell you that his prescription wasn't going to work.	No
2917	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of the state, excuse me.	No
27518	They must not develop nuclear capacity.	No
11446	So I think the idea of humility is important.	No
20741	I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	No
9026	I think we should all have respect for innocent life.	No
15102	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	No
22909	Our Guard and our reserves have been transformed into almost active service.	No
2320	So what did we do?	No
21411	I'm here tonight for these young people here on the balcony of this university.	No
29711	And when I look at what's happening in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's happening in different parts of our country, if that's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day -- we need law and order in our country.	No
12607	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	Yes
19182	Men's wages have not risen, they have fallen.	Yes
25240	It is a question of leadership.	No
2586	And we -- we're looking for discovery and innovation, all these desired things from the American heart to ensure the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	No
19846	I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	No
19870	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I have to say, if it's one of your successes, I wouldn't talk too much about it.	No
28412	But if everyone here in this audience had died in the middle of the middle class, then the tax reductions for each of you all added up would be less than the tax reduction his plan would give only one member of that richest 1%.	Yes
13673	The answer is to invest and grow this economy.	No
6736	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	No
24616	"And once I called someone, ""Well, change your behavior."	No
9242	So here's what I've done since I've been president.	No
31983	Mine are words, and his was action.	No
20558	I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	No
613	We're gonna have to... the MX.	No
32563	She doesn't do anything but talk.	No
16497	And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	No
26318	I am going to speak to the American people.	No
28116	It's part of a global review.	No
25602	This weakens the chances of civilization's survival.	No
17854	If the job was over, I could have thought twice about looking for a re-election for this position.	No
9297	It's about bringing back good jobs for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
26913	Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.	Yes
19121	I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a Chicago doctor named Dr. Kalikian.	No
27452	I took seven steps, paralyzing sanctions were number one.	No
24771	Again, we have projects all over Washington.	No
8748	Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	No
1668	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	Yes
19743	But again, it is almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	No
8404	In fact, it will be necessary to increase taxes.	No
18465	I do not think he was misleading when he said he was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	No
26632	The first thing we have to do is get you a job.	No
9506	And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	No
22953	Thank you very much, Ann.	No
25401	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	No
3148	We have seen in this world a development of a huge threat to us.	No
12906	Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	Yes
7071	They come here to work.	No
33147	What kind of rights will the Americans have?	No
29192	What they do to us is a very, very sad thing.	No
12941	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	Yes
821	Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	No
26574	But maybe there should be other debates.	No
22213	First, as part of my program, we would provide matching funds to the states to teach everyone a job to read in the next 5 years and give everyone with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in large places on the job.	No
2510	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	Yes
29758	You need better relations between the communities and the police, because in some cases it's not good.	No
19671	Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	Yes
28543	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	No
18217	We didn't need that tax cut.	No
1295	We have seen in many cases in recent years a minority business section of the administration of small loans, the administration of small businesses lends to a black entrepreneur just enough money to start, and then go bankrupt.	Yes
27342	I can manage this more effectively than the federal government and the states, moreover, prove.	No
12453	I have a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new highly qualified teachers and help local school districts build new schools.	Yes
2680	We cut taxes 19 times.	Yes
17779	And I don't think that should be part of the political dialogue.	No
6579	We will restore the tax discipline we had in the 1990s.	No
16088	But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	Yes
1209	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	No
5989	And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	No
7893	I submit to you that when you look at its programs, its program for example with respect to the Federal Reserve and - free money or free money - high interest rates, its economic program are generally the programs that were adopted and tested during the Truman administration.	Yes
23495	I remember being in New York State talking to FBI agents who helped destroy a cell in Lackawanna up there.	No
6315	And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	No
6625	No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.	No
23101	And I think we will be able to get a cure that has alluded to everyone because we know how to do it.	No
28809	So, to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to say it is affirmative access.	No
4113	"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	No
21921	But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	No
8733	When you stop thinking that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that geologists believe to contain a lot in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the government, and the government with its own restrictions and regulations, that creates the energy crisis.	Yes
1563	We were discouraged and alienated.	No
15408	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	No
23670	Put a head fake on us.	No
20459	I'm going to ask Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	No
12153	And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	Yes
34288	This does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities that are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	No
580	And because we have not listened to the defenders of the freeze and strengthened the defence of this country, we now have the first agreement on arms control in the nuclear age.	Yes
25626	I remember crossing the California coast one day.	No
22732	I'm talking to Silvio Berlusconi.	No
8360	Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	No
2011	And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	No
27353	Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	Yes
3208	And I think we used our skills.	No
3496	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	No
7948	I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.	No
5976	We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.	No
17653	We have set a line of 130 percent so that we can direct this aid to the most needy.	Yes
9195	But if you were to calculate this unemployment rate, bringing back those who left the workforce, it would be 10.7 per cent.	Yes
17359	The Americans want their children to be educated.	No
22691	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	No
16383	We love you, and we're grateful for everything you've given us.	No
22407	May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.	No
24503	And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	No
23655	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	No
27825	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	Yes
20229	I want everyone who pays taxes to lower their tax rates.	No
32582	I will be the president and we will get it done.	No
18404	What I think is disturbing a lot of people in our country is that the president just described some kind of mistake.	No
9257	But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	No
2718	And the reason is because of her people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job with that new training she got; because a company in Minnesota that was willing to give up the wages and benefits for their executives to make sure they didn't lay off the workers during a recession.	No
17310	I, too, want this wall that is in the Constitution of the separation of the Church and the State to remain there.	No
7231	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	Yes
27672	But we have some work to do.	No
17966	And I think President Bush and I love our country the same way.	No
27827	Governor Romney, you didn't...	No
17094	We believe that our tax reduction has played a very important role in this economic recovery.	No
15199	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	No
1902	Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	No
12953	We use about 50% of our steel capacity today.	Yes
3231	This has not been an ancient history story.	No
15963	We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.	No
21042	Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	No
10825	So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	No
8523	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	No
9354	Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	Yes
1412	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	Yes
26338	I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.	No
29887	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	No
22653	I would have brought our allies to our side.	No
7022	Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.	Yes
27681	This is important for Afghanistan's success.	No
27900	No, I'm not wrong.	No
3688	They are crushed, and many of them are bankrupt as a result of health care.	Yes
27601	"And the last conversation she had with her father was that he was calling twin towers, saying, ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I'll always look after you."""	No
26805	We should have more debate.	No
25414	I would not agree with negotiations or agreements that involved behaviour on the part of the Soviet Union that we could not verify every day.	No
16801	This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	No
20412	Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	No
15117	I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	Yes
18693	"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	No
5806	And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	No
23344	We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.	Yes
8747	I think that, as far as housing is concerned, when we consume, even if our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we consume, by a factor of two, the amount of energy they consume in this country.	Yes
7502	We can lift our schools up.	No
26462	For four years, that's what I've been working on.	No
7787	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	No
27464	Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	No
8433	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	No
15248	We have the sources here.	No
25803	Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	Yes
12012	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is that we know immediately whether someone should have a weapon or not.	No
11035	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the rise in power.	No
21248	And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.	No
3068	These characteristics of our country have been threatened by Mr Ford.	No
33744	He sent jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	Yes
26825	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	No
2728	I kept that promise and if you vote for me, then I promise to fight so hard in a second term.	No
13823	And then if a little of this comes in my way, they load it with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	No
19484	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	Yes
32813	She doesn't get it done.	No
6175	"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	No
27803	We absolutely must make more progress, and that is why we will continue to press.	No
22160	I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
18906	The United States is pursuing a new series of nuclear weapons.	Yes
6979	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	Yes
34096	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	Yes
6311	Recently, his key economic advisor was asked why he didn't seem to have specific programs to help young people go to university and the answer was, well, you know, we can't give money to all the interest groups that come.	Yes
26061	You can be on well-being.	No
13806	But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.	No
9035	And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	No
8739	all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.	No
5700	Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	No
34451	Our inner cities are a disaster.	No
27840	Let's... let's...	No
34056	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	Yes
21598	Everybody's running against the incumbent.	No
1245	I think it is very important for our cities to know that they have a partner in the federal government.	No
23642	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	No
21610	We're going back to Washington and we're having a hard time going through Congress.	No
19646	We closed the loopholes, we attacked the big companies.	No
34	But I think we're all in this business together, and my appeal to the American people is values in schools.	No
13325	He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	Yes
12632	In Africa, these countries have just joined the United Nations.	No
12260	And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.	No
33693	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	Yes
12965	Why didn't we bring students over here?	No
17997	Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	No
18751	And we knew the limits of their nuclear energy.	No
22247	These schools belong to you.	No
19109	We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
201	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	Yes
31959	I am going to help the inner cities.	No
22301	So I think it's worth a try.	No
21978	It is because we have not grown.	No
28123	The acceleration of drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	No
18099	That is why it is essential that we ensure that weapons of mass destruction are not in the hands of people like Al-Qaida, who we are.	No
7085	If they want to become citizens, they can also stay online.	No
20969	But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	No
14940	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.	Yes
33951	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	Yes
1379	Every time I had a vacancy in the Supreme Court of Georgia - and I filled five of these positions out of seven in total and about half of the Court of Appeal of judges, about 35 percent of the judges of first instance - I was given by an objective jury the five most qualified people in Georgia.	Yes
14636	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, was the economy in the doldrums.	No
34297	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	Yes
33941	I think it would be a great gesture.	No
161	Expenditure increased by only 4%.	Yes
27851	We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	No
27266	Two thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	Yes
30406	Where did you get this?	No
7321	They don't reach those goals.	No
14938	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	No
26200	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	No
10053	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	No
7683	And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.	No
27795	And, you know, that's -- you're right.	No
26322	The President has no ideas, so he's destroying ours.	No
367	And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	No
17468	And no one has approached it from that matter.	No
28139	And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	Yes
23630	I'm trying to decipher this.	No
9037	Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	No
14258	That is why I have tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress knows what the American people voted in favour.	No
7526	And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	No
24106	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to reduce those spending and discipline, although I think we should totally exempt social security.	No
34071	We accepted the results when we may not have liked them.	No
2967	First of all, I do not criticize His Holiness the Pope.	No
29692	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	No
16532	The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	No
20647	Morale in today's military is too low.	No
29535	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	No
20425	The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	No
5971	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	No
21260	You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	No
15398	We're now working on the communications industry.	Yes
23224	We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	Yes
24372	To do what Congress and Governor Clinton suggest, you would isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	No
28705	I care a lot about this.	No
17128	What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	No
26421	In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.	Yes
25781	I know you do it.	No
22139	We can't be the policeman all over the world anymore.	No
19130	Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	No
32265	They'll never be the same.	No
25419	It's more difficult to defend this nation.	No
32480	But we are reducing the tax rate from 35% to 15%.	Yes
23546	To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	No
13935	Oh, no, it's gonna cost jobs, but it's not -- let me say that.	No
9029	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	No
33289	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	No
11913	I don't know exactly how you're increasing the death penalty.	No
10767	The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	Yes
18882	And I've never deviated from my life.	No
16849	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	No
11365	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	No
28924	Not only was an innocent person executed, but the actual perpetrator of the crime was not held responsible.	Yes
16860	I think the way to get tax fairness in this country is to provide tax relief to middle-income people who have an income of about $8,000 up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	No
16189	Come on, give me five.	No
8426	But we also want our education to be free from federal control.	No
18061	And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	Yes
16396	That's why I feel that if a policeman is shot, the death penalty is required.	No
19129	Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.	No
23901	I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.	No
20908	But here are some differences, Jim.	No
25440	It's the most dangerous technology we have.	No
15836	But we used this as a model, the way he took the understandable pride of his legacy, what his family means to him.	No
31922	And we're going to make America rich again, because if you don't do that, it's just -- it seems hard to say, but we have to build the wealth of our nation.	No
17011	I owe the special interests nothing.	No
11053	We are a force of good in the world.	No
21099	There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.	Yes
8976	It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	Yes
19328	I don't like trial lawyers.	No
19474	You're talking about the Brady Bill.	No
11171	I understand what it's like to send young Americans in danger.	No
25369	And if such a defence could be found, would it not be much more humanitarian to say that now we can defend ourselves against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of killing millions of people?	No
30198	I know how to win.	No
1657	So I want to wish you a happy birthday and let you know that from one year on, we will not celebrate it in front of 40 million people.	No
8130	I am not satisfied when many of our teachers are poorly paid, or when our children go to school on a part-time basis.	No
33557	We cannot continue to allow ourselves - she took this as saying nuclear weapons.	No
2748	If the president is re-elected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	No
13270	U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	No
12614	What are the chances of freedom in these areas?	No
9522	Bring us to a balanced budget.	No
11037	And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	No
32009	And Donald insulted them and attacked them for weeks about their religion.	Yes
28045	Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.	Yes
8260	He was appointed by her.	No
23217	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	No
17905	America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
16719	But as long as we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as President for ensuring that security precautions are initiated and maintained.	No
14732	But we've got to do even better.	No
13203	Therefore, the Treaty does not call on the United States to defend anything, with the exception of Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts directed against that area of the Treaty.	Yes
975	We live-we bring everybody along.	No
2814	It has to be changed.	No
13299	I disapprove of the issue.	No
21771	In fact, you should have a few amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	No
6926	The Lewin report states precisely that there will be 20 million people, more than 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	Yes
18746	If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	No
17917	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	No
19421	Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.	No
5725	Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.	No
10760	That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	No
16795	And he's still talking about - uh, success.	No
16379	We do not work alone with the government, but we all work together.	No
2492	Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.	No
25537	Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	Yes
29282	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think about solutions.	Yes
24361	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	No
21740	So why pass a law that doesn't fix it?	No
15991	The federal government continues to spend too much.	No
16010	We have ensured that the Social Security Trust Fund is strong.	No
21983	It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.	No
20631	That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	No
11475	But in the last 24 hours, there has been some subsidization of violence there.	Yes
27084	They're willing to work with us.	Yes
33167	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	No
16037	I don't have a list yet.	No
1250	I also support the use of revenue-sharing money for local governments and the elimination of prohibitions on the use of revenue-sharing money so that it can be used to improve education and health care.	No
7132	It's been a long time to raise the minimum wage.	No
12710	We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	No
11889	And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	No
5854	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	No
18513	But I think it's worth it, Jim.	No
24130	If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.	No
12174	I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	No
4021	And this was August, a year ago.	No
33094	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	No
28439	I have a strategy for the Middle East.	No
13865	Today, I met with the presidents and vice-presidents of the Willow Run Union near here.	No
25444	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	Yes
3753	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
16038	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	No
19348	Let's be honest.	No
25596	America is not temporary, we are forever.	No
7802	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	No
11512	And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	No
25553	But I think this is a very interesting proposal, to see if we can first find something that makes these weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	No
590	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino arrived.	Yes
12201	And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	Yes
26033	Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	Yes
14418	But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	No
16783	As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.	Yes
11953	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand, he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	No
24104	I don't think we have to.	No
1710	Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	No
24980	I think a lot of things they've done are bad in any concept of morality we have.	No
16369	I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	No
24807	There is another group to which I feel very close, and these among the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of those who died and the people who left parts of their bodies there.	No
10885	Senator McCain is talking a lot about drilling, and it's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
33390	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald proposed, that he started his campaign to harass immigrants, call Mexican rapists and criminals and drug traffickers, that he has a very different vision than what we should do to deal with immigrants.	Yes
4179	I use the same words as your counselors.	No
13292	Well, the question - Mr Griffin, I think, who is the leader of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
22440	Everyone says you can't do this with Congress.	No
11289	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are determined to erase you from the map, call your country a stinking corpse?	No
32489	We are going to be thriving again.	No
24095	The problem I have with Perot's prescription is that almost all the economists who looked at him say that if you reduce the deficit so quickly, it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	Yes
17019	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	No
16741	Such things should be done, they should be encouraged and supported, and even demanded by the government, yes.	No
28448	We cannot dictate the terms of peace, which means that you must be stable.	No
1844	At the same time as my tax system has already reduced taxes for 98 percent of families, I have also reduced taxes for small businesses 18 times.	Yes
11954	I don't know where he came from.	No
4093	But we will also, I believe, have to engage in difficult direct diplomacy with Iran, and that is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, that by not talking to the people we punish, we have not worked.	No
6036	That is why I think it is important for us to get loan guarantees from car manufacturers, but we must hold them accountable as well to start producing the fuel-efficient cars of the future.	No
19590	When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.	No
29305	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	No
23637	I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	No
24110	And I'm afraid that's what Governor Clinton told me.	No
7498	I care if it's going to work for America and if it's going to make us stronger.	No
16270	And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	No
6901	If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	No
32582	I'll be the president and we'll do it.	No
21183	I think that the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions on issues and proposals are.	No
3076	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Britain and West Germany.	Yes
505	Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.	Yes
19624	And I hope that will happen.	No
18968	And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	No
11512	And so, the term honest broker has meaning.	No
20326	I think we should give seniors more options.	No
16974	Well, one of the very serious things that has happened in our government in recent years, and that has continued so far, is a break in trust between our people in [twenty-seven minutes late]	No
1997	I have my own plan.	No
27202	But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	No
24021	I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	No
20822	A charter school run by people from Teach For America.	No
6629	And that's what I would say to that person.	No
11869	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	No
29690	And we have to do several things at the same time.	No
26787	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	No
18071	The world is better without Saddam Hussein.	No
6464	Only 95 per cent -- 95 per cent come today without inspection.	Yes
25956	And it seems to me that what needs to be done is not only about tobacco, but also about drugs, because drug use between the ages of 12 and 17 has doubled in this administration over the last 44 months.	Yes
27263	And I'm going to put us on the path to a balanced budget.	No
33967	Money goes to 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including many military.	Yes
7235	And what I would like to do is that the National Guard and the Reserve are deployed differently here in our country.	No
24919	You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.	No
25821	So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	No
22421	I'm just not going to do that.	No
12868	I would say that Eastern Europe is the vulnerable zone of the Soviet Union.	No
29528	And in a way, I should be complaining.	No
6981	The CBO said very clearly that if you adopted the President's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in social security, because today's workers pay the system for today's retirees.	Yes
13958	I think it was exports that saved us when we were in a global slowdown, a related global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	No
28896	No, I'm not proud of that.	No
33747	I fought against that as a senator.	Yes
13328	I think that the moment when you give the union, on the one hand, and the management, on the other hand, the escape to finally go to the government to settle it, that most of these big strikes will eventually be settled by the government, and that it will be one - to be at the end, in my opinion, wage control; that would mean price control - all things we do not want.	No
24282	I have number 1 and 1A.	No
24709	I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.	Yes
32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	No
32464	Why didn't she change it?	No
10129	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	No
6561	But the fact is, we're going to help the Americans join it.	No
2226	We must ensure that this programme is there for the long term.	No
9669	That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	No
33322	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	No
23029	I just want to make sure they're safe.	No
15310	That's how he'll stay.	No
20082	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell us that we love each other.	No
8739	All we have to do is get the government out of the oil industry, and that will be enough.	No
2616	This seems to be a trend.	No
18008	And that's how it's best to keep peace.	No
25709	I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	No
8080	Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	No
9290	And if we do that, if we do what I intend to do, which gives us the energy independence, the energy independence of North America within eight years, you will see manufacturing jobs coming back.	No
17744	[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	No
13442	I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	No
6379	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	No
15180	I'm not talking about tearing.	No
3600	I think these are quite important priorities.	No
20057	They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	No
3295	All possible diplomatic means have been used.	No
22167	We can't impose it, but we have to feed it and that's the kind of thing I would do as president -- follow these three commitments in the future.	No
27387	We are now less than 285.	Yes
12814	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	Yes
7640	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	No
27872	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	No
12827	Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	No
12111	Second, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you are a family of $30,000 or less -- it decreases as you increase -- that you can use to buy health care in private markets.	Yes
11820	That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	No
27686	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	No
16411	Thank you very, very much.	No
17716	We will see that this is not the case.	No
11877	Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.	No
23635	It's one way to help reduce abortions.	No
6461	The measure is not: Are we safer?	No
8199	We find that there have been more constructions in this administration than in the previous administration.	Yes
25055	That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.	No
14981	And then, thanks to tax incentives, cause the creation of businesses providing jobs and so on in these areas.	No
28612	I'd like our farmers to feed the world.	No
8321	I think that's the wrong direction.	No
32889	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	No
20730	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	No
7024	And if we're financially responsible and get America back to work, we're gonna fix social security.	No
7848	Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.	Yes
3147	He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	No
18010	And that's what they are.	No
13308	It must be a test of a man.	No
20566	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
20557	It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.	No
24955	A president must know these things.	No
25629	And I wondered what it would be for someone -- wondering if anyone in 100 years would drive this road, and if they would see the same thing.	No
13761	But I don't think it's fair.	No
14146	They have not been forthcoming.	No
7906	I would not be able to meet with him unless there were preparations for this conference that would give us reasonable certainty - reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	No
19054	We have done a lot of work together over the past three and a half years.	No
15342	Allusions to fundamental changes in the minimum wage are another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan made on unemployment compensation.	No
5897	That is the fact that all the details must be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	No
25707	Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	No
13099	As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	No
28552	I think we should raise the age at which young people can have a weapon.	No
8208	We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.	Yes
4360	This is the central question of our time.	No
25244	I read his statement the other day.	No
24532	I am categorically opposed to the legalization of drugs.	No
859	I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for this position.	No
19550	And institutions are beginning to function.	No
29574	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	No
25636	And then I thought, what are they going to say about us, what are these people going to think in 100 years?	No
29057	I think it's the people's money.	No
2967	(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	No
25001	I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	No
17125	Almost all the economic analyses I have heard of, including the Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a deficit of $263 billion.	Yes
17224	I guess I'm kind of reminded of what Will Rogers said about Hoover.	No
21806	Let's start with a premise.	No
8055	I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.	No
10145	But let me mention something else.	No
28571	They're targeting the real problem.	No
16588	When I took it, we had a bureaucratic disorder, as we did in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, offices, commissions - uh some, uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having the responsibility to carry it out was in conflict.	Yes
25051	We should deal with each of these countries separately.	No
1295	We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	Yes
22755	But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.	No
2430	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	No
27142	No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	No
14542	Forty-three -- more than that -- the states have it, I think.	Yes
12757	And for this reason, he contributed to any lack of prestige.	No
2565	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	No
20242	And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	No
25435	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	No
20424	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	No
22622	So I tried diplomacy, I went to the UN.	No
24407	The American aircraft are now helping humanitarian aid in Sarajevo.	Yes
8791	But I leave you with this thought, sir, to be precise enough in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if it were to become impossible; if I could not, despite the best efforts I have asked Congress to propose, increase those wages, incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country defenceless.	No
12769	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	No
12948	I served it uh - in the war.	No
18531	I think my plan is better.	No
15922	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	No
8992	But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.	No
13460	Now, as far as my position is concerned, it is exactly the opposite of that of the honourable senator.	No
23644	I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	No
6974	It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	No
29917	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	No
33716	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	Yes
8204	But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	No
4372	They now hold a trillion dollars of our debt.	Yes
14367	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	Yes
19125	You work harder and harder to reach the ends and put food on the table.	No
13769	And yes, I had to veto two bills on civil rights quotas because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	Yes
26117	I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	No
13266	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	Yes
6070	Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.	Yes
26913	Mali has been recaptured, the northern part of Mali, by al-Qaeda-type individuals.	Yes
10851	We are in a difficult economic period, as we all know.	No
28909	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	No
16595	When I arrive in Washington, D.C., as a foreigner, one of the main responsibilities I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of executive power.	No
9606	Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.	Yes
24704	When we talk about reducing health care costs, let's start with insurance companies and people who do murder instead of making our people healthy.	No
9019	But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	No
29105	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	No
19090	I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	No
16803	There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.	Yes
25790	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	No
33959	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	No
17959	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	No
707	You have to make choices.	No
17405	Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	No
192	It is transmitted either as an increase in prices or as a person decommissioned so that the company can continue to be competitive.	No
1874	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	Yes
23144	You know what it is?	No
13343	One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.	No
28885	You'll be in a world that fits into my philosophy.	No
12042	And the Los Angeles Times spent a lot of ink to get in.	No
7150	Now, I think it is a fundamental right issue that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	No
19994	And not about personal things.	No
27789	And then we noticed that there were more than one with the same serial number.	No
27922	When you got to the office, just over 10 trillion dollars in debt, now 16 trillion dollars in debt.	Yes
8503	One of them was a twenty-five cents per hour bill for anyone who works in a store or business that has a million dollars per year of business.	Yes
11008	Now, the last point I'm going to make on this whole issue of government intrusion and warrants -- it's absolutely true that I think it's important for the government to fight against insurance companies that cheat on their customers, that don't give you the right character, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you won't get it.	No
24921	That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	No
18706	My attitude is that you are taking preventive measures to protect the American people, that you are acting to secure this country.	No
3231	It wasn't an ancient story.	No
2601	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	No
10935	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	No
23347	And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	No
15187	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	Yes
730	It's my position on the SDI and it's never a little agitated.	Yes
18982	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	No
15083	When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	Yes
25515	Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	No
7594	As far as Cuba is concerned, let me clarify one thing.	No
14389	It's happening night and day.	No
3085	And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.	No
20504	I hope the FDA has taken its time to make sure that American women will be safe using this medication.	No
6271	Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	Yes
3245	He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	No
28179	I am absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	No
17571	I don't think we can do this for a few years.	No
24283	One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	No
10018	And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	No
14727	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	No
1592	But now, less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own house.	Yes
18691	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the pictures."""	No
3692	We need to invest in science and technology.	No
20415	I think that is the wrong choice.	No
11713	Now, there are places I think -- you know, I supported the Columbia administration.	No
1567	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he has been in office for more than eight hundred days, almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	No
11053	We are a force of good in the world.	No
27031	Here's one thing I learned as commander-in-chief.	No
1430	And inflation affects everyone: those who work and those who are on well-being.	No
2695	But, listen, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anyone, Democrat or Republican, as long as they advance the cause of making middle class families stronger and giving opportunity scales to the middle class.	No
14953	Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.	Yes
5872	Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	Yes
16005	So I don't want to have fun with that.	No
18757	Today, four to seven nuclear weapons are in North Korea's hands.	Yes
12659	We have seen the lowest rate of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
6704	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to break the budget 277 times.	Yes
17906	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	No
2630	And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	Yes
8847	for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	No
17708	There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	Yes
22338	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it were.	No
21784	So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	No
9887	Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	No
25788	Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	No
15630	(Laughter, applause scattered) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more friendly these days than I was back in my youth when I started in my state legislature.	No
21645	So you've got to create jobs.	No
11106	They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	Yes
18219	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	No
15588	No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.	No
13600	Raising a little more money, spending money on tax incentives to grow in the private sector, taking money from defence cuts and reinvesting it in new transport and communication systems and environmental cleaning.	No
19902	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	No
33575	It's the only way to keep peace.	No
16642	So, I think our employee reduction record, plus the failure of the governor's programs to really save employment in Georgia, shows what's the best plan.	No
17812	In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	Yes
2954	And if Mr. Carter claims that His Holiness by signing it did, it is totally inaccurate.	No
15539	More importantly, this was the first national security decision we had to make.	Yes
32161	Number one, insurance companies cannot refuse coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	Yes
28709	And God bless them, each of them has decided for himself to come here tonight.	No
8686	Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	No
15097	These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	No
13237	I see mothers holding their babies, so they can see a man who could be president of the United States.	No
21974	When businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	No
19888	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	No
20144	I could never have dreamed that something like that would come into my life, and I did my best to be faithful to the burden you gave me.	No
2829	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	No
23224	We now have a deficit of $2.6 trillion.	Yes
25346	These high interest rates - the real rates that doubled under this administration - have had the same effect on Mexico, and so on, and the cost of repaying these debts is so huge that it leads to massive unemployment, hardship and grief.	Yes
8245	I know what it means to be poor.	No
32184	We currently have nearly 20 trillion dollars in debt.	Yes
6311	Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	Yes
22888	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	No
2481	I used to consult with companies -- excuse me, hospitals and health care providers.	No
20151	And I think what others could do for our country and for themselves if we did the social welfare reform in the proper way.	No
22087	What do we have to do?	No
25762	And I think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	No
3586	It's a system that needs to be cleaned.	No
9081	We've got to stop drifting.	No
31984	That's what he did to women.	No
9422	Candy, it's not okay...	No
28902	During the 1994 campaign, I was asked to support the death penalty.	No
20474	We don't have to do this.	No
26846	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	No
8610	Thirdly, I think the question for the American people is: when he looks at this country and looks at the world around it, the objectives are the same for all Americans.	No
26028	I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	No
12131	49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	Yes
21089	You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.	No
17095	We reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	Yes
128	Now is the time to release our liners?	No
15637	And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
11247	That is what we have done over the last eight years, and it has actually made us safer.	Yes
25251	And let's talk about people we do control.	No
18687	No president, throughout American history, has ever given up, and I would not, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	Yes
5838	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	No
22627	That's why he called him a grave threat.	No
13282	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
34293	But I just have to...	No
6293	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	No
525	In my own state, for example, we now have this universal health care system, which the Vice-President opposes, I think very misguided.	Yes
5932	She understands that better than almost any American I know.	No
19711	They are always very faithful to us, and I appreciate that.	No
110	Secondly, we must invest in economic growth in that country, in all regions of the country.	No
23000	I don't see how the Iraqis will trust the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there first.	No
13033	See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	No
9080	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	No
29409	Just go to her website.	No
4284	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	No
11309	If you change your behaviour, then it is possible for you to join the community of nations.	No
23445	Now he says he's only going to tax the rich.	Yes
14464	But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.	No
8349	I do not say that I have made the decisions.	No
6574	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	Yes
6127	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and then you're going to fall into the category where you're going to have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind he mandates for you.	Yes
19393	They're sophisticated people watching tonight.	No
9046	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	No
26261	I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	No
28059	He says you can't gag a doctor, the doctor can advise you.	No
15530	But I'm going to tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 and 40 now have someone in their generation who is going to be vice-president of the United States of America.	No
28140	I want to streamline the approval of competing generic drugs and new types of treatments that can compete with them so that we reduce the price for everyone.	No
11762	So I'm going to look wherever we invest money.	No
3030	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	No
14434	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	Yes
18041	Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.	Yes
17857	During the first half of 1980, productivity fell by less than 2%.	Yes
24339	the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	No
3565	But let's be clear: Marks represent $18 billion in last year's budget.	Yes
111	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	No
7031	Most tax cuts were granted to low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
20789	Let me give you some specific examples.	No
12630	I don't think they do, enough.	No
22955	This president and his administration told you that it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of whether, it's a question of when.	No
1365	Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	Yes
12014	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	Yes
23881	We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	No
9705	And its forecasts for the next four years are more deficits, almost as large.	Yes
9001	But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	No
1027	Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.	Yes
3903	We have seen Afghanistan get worse and worse.	No
13236	One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	No
13254	I think the President was right, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights during the conference.	No
34329	We have become very, very negligent.	No
29128	Our jobs run away from the country.	Yes
32239	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	No
20357	Look, he's a man with a lot of numbers.	No
14346	I'd like to see those written instructions.	No
28421	You talk about eight years?	No
7421	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	No
22835	I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	No
33628	We protect people, they have to pay.	No
14626	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	No
12460	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement safety, and I ask for your support.	No
28875	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	No
12567	Extending it to everyone because the communist goal is not to hold their own, but to extend communism.	No
3902	The question is, was this wise?	No
2384	And so let's focus on reducing costs for people, rather than increasing it with the $2,500 extra bonus.	No
15734	I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	No
7658	I talked to black mothers.	No
26113	A part of my tax package that is paid in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars of people's earnings when they sell their house, which, I think, is the greatest capital benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	Yes
26933	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	Yes
21110	If you reduce the amount in 1 on every $6, then you have to reduce the value of each cheque by 1 on every $6 unless you arrive with the money from another place.	No
24225	And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.	No
34056	They concluded that there were no cases; he said the FBI was rigged.	Yes
7832	I am in favour of that rather than massive federal spending programs that will generally come into effect long after you have gone through the recession.	No
17449	I believe that until someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then this child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness for all of us.	No
23921	I don't know -- we'll talk to Ross in a minute.	No
18552	Soldiers know it's not done yet.	No
23509	And the president was very busy running all over the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say that I'm a washy-wishy, that I'm a freak.	No
22367	This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	No
26765	And I remember cases where people would cross the street instead of meeting someone in a wheelchair.	No
28912	Is the person guilty of the crime?	No
11476	It is too much to hope that this will continue, but I hope that it will continue.	No
2100	I had a friend who told me you didn't pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, okay?	No
20882	First, the difference is that there are no new accountability measures in Vice-President Gore's plan.	Yes
24813	We owe you a debt that we can never repay you.	No
20987	In this case, in the event of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before making the decision on what the government should or should not do.	No
19597	They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	Yes
8246	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	No
3812	And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they succeeded.	No
1322	But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	No
29746	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	No
17531	The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	No
16664	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	Yes
1770	I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.	No
10118	But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	No
817	A report on international terrorism, chaired by the Vice-President, had been published and had made very specific recommendations on how to combat terrorism.	Yes
20838	They went to Austin High School.	No
24757	As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.	Yes
21847	He can buy a cheaper insurance than Mom and Pop's store around the corner.	Yes
5789	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	No
29175	You know, Donald's had a lot of luck in his life, and that's all to his advantage.	No
386	I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.	No
15006	But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	No
20117	Let's take all these four years in a row.	No
7645	And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	No
13433	The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.	Yes
14914	The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	No
155	So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.	No
12773	I believe that the Soviet Union is the first in space.	No
26391	We will do this with regulatory reform.	No
846	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	No
11732	That's what we did in Haiti.	No
14206	Now, the leaders will always make mistakes.	No
2352	I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.	No
16504	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	Yes
3666	And that's just a fact.	Yes
8905	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	No
15967	It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	Yes
32023	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	No
19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington who trust each other.	No
16616	In addition, we saw a 2 per cent increase in the number of employees last year.	Yes
7864	He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	No
17371	I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	No
14289	I think she's a key person.	No
24338	And so, we have a good army.	No
24968	Thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the file.	No
3904	We need more troops there.	No
265	"He said, ""I am a strong Liberal Democrat"" - August, 87."	No
111	Building this type of growth increases revenues and helps to reduce the deficit.	No
3856	You talk about the surge.	No
24956	I don't know what's worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping him.	No
13769	And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	Yes
26477	We had 1.2 million bankruptcies, set a new record.	Yes
8609	In August 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of a Republican in the Senate on that occasion.	Yes
22120	The Soviet Union is no longer, and now we are working to help them become fully democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led, a great democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, we all managed to pass this thing -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you are for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	Yes
20773	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	Yes
25715	What we really should focus on tonight is what we have to do to help the American people make the most of this future.	No
25214	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approached the President to say, ""Don't put these troops there."""	Yes
19428	But here, you cut off the drug tsar's office 83 percent.	Yes
6950	Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	No
10602	But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.	No
10393	That's why I'm asking you for your vote, and that's why I'm asking you for another four years.	No
6306	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	Yes
5702	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	Yes
3746	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.	No
18756	Although they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were evicted, the television cameras were evicted.	Yes
17303	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I oppose -- what I oppose is someone who seeks to use his faith to question the faith of others or to use that faith and who seeks to use the power of government to impose it on others.	No
27398	First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.	No
27598	And if we had asked Pakistan's permission, we wouldn't have had it.	No
32275	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say it.	No
3431	How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	No
28335	94% come from the local level.	Yes
16247	There will be no more debates.	No
19476	And with regard to the prohibition of assault weapons, out of 17 weapons that have been banned, only six have now been banned because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	Yes
21683	And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	No
1723	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	Yes
3802	And finally, we found a great general and a successful strategy.	No
15432	It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	No
10324	The government does not create jobs.	No
28601	I want to amend these provisions.	No
2246	That's -- that's a big topic.	No
16278	I met them, I know them, I spent time in South America speaking the language, as did Senator Bentsen.	No
8780	Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that in September 1980 - this very month - there was a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	Yes
1940	The problem of rising taxes is that it slows down the growth rate.	Yes
33101	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	No
14394	We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	Yes
16859	Now, if you uh - taking the middle-income or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - Governor Carter publicly indicated in an interview that he would increase taxes on about 50 percent of the workers in this country.	Yes
28451	That's what a leader does.	No
25459	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	No
23414	I have a plan to cover those folks.	Yes
24793	We need to change the system.	No
27267	The training of new enterprises has fallen to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	Yes
25924	When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.	Yes
509	We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	Yes
13612	Well, he doesn't like cheating on the government, but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we've created 15 million jobs.	Yes
13959	And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	No
32045	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	No
19141	But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.	Yes
3242	I hope Mr Ford doesn't either.	No
19496	You're not gonna worry about it anymore.	No
21462	You know, no one likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a bag of punches; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	No
13701	And I'll do it.	No
869	I've picked a lot of people.	No
1215	And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	Yes
28520	The Vice-President mentioned my long-term view for the military.	No
9067	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were faced with only two choices, with only two men, and only two parties.	No
32596	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	Yes
9725	And the plans that I talked about will create even more.	No
3079	We make up about 30 percent of the influence of the world's economic trade power.	Yes
10171	What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.	No
13806	But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer from his friends in the U.S. Congress, go back to what it was when you had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.	No
33853	"He attacked the journalist who wrote the story, called it ""disgusting,"" as he called it a number of women during the campaign."	Yes
1560	The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	No
8805	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	Yes
23019	And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	No
27071	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	Yes
21233	I want to make sure that prescription drugs are available to all seniors.	No
8852	But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	No
9522	Getting us to a balanced budget.	No
25155	The terrorists have won each time.	No
8887	if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.	No
13659	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the rich who granted tax relief to the middle class.	Yes
22896	One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.	No
1376	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	Yes
16371	That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	No
5852	And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.	No
15926	And this is really going to be a challenge for the next President of the United States; I don't think there is any question about it.	No
17900	Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?	No
1935	One, of course, is to raise taxes.	No
28760	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	No
18276	I think it's worthy of follow-up.	No
27669	This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	Yes
9899	And that's what we did.	No
32088	She got it from the United States Congress.	Yes
29692	We must work to ensure that our police use the best training, the best techniques, that they are well prepared to use force only if necessary.	No
22219	And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choice -- I prefer public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about it if you want.	No
8993	Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	No
12179	But it's not a statement about his heart.	No
3336	Let me reaffirm our policy.	No
12562	And this example that President Eisenhower has given, we will continue to follow.	No
27084	They're ready to work with us.	Yes
19393	These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	No
32282	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself to defend our country in the American army, was attacked by Donald.	Yes
13166	It's a question of who they are.	No
390	Builders and community leaders are ready.	No
1349	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	No
22627	That's why he called it a serious threat.	No
12252	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	Yes
29036	I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.	No
28134	They discover great new cures and that's great.	No
20627	It is up to the people of this region to take control of their country.	No
14272	We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	Yes
24750	I'm tired of being told we can't.	No
25137	The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	No
25772	I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	No
25557	Mr Mondale, may I ask you to address the issue of nuclear strategy?	No
639	I thought the administration was against the midgetman.	No
26345	We had a better idea.	No
33744	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	Yes
27977	I'm going to put us on the path to a balanced budget.	No
28808	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	No
13872	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	No
28265	But that's what I said.	No
26003	Let's talk about it separately.	No
15502	And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	No
3731	Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	No
24085	We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	No
23339	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	Yes
18801	Today, we have a draft in the background in America: people with loss-stop programs where they are told that you can't get out of the army; nine of our 10 active service divisions engaged in Iraq in one way or another, either go, come or prepare.	Yes
24969	I'm sure that you appreciate that.	No
12115	I think that's the very best way to go.	No
9662	That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	No
15209	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	Yes
3763	There's no doubt it's going to affect our budgets.	No
15770	And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	No
29020	Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll start by answering your questions -- your last question.	No
23943	You have questioned my patriotism.	No
12380	And yes, I think that's something that people have to consider.	No
6370	And it's great to be with you again.	No
11289	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	No
30190	You didn't hear what I said.	No
33282	And I do not believe the government should be making it.	No
27274	That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	No
2555	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	No
14717	I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.	No
25642	We met the young America.	No
24184	You don't have anywhere to sleep.	No
9573	"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	No
26402	The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	Yes
32074	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	No
16132	It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	No
27631	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they rush to build much more.	Yes
13237	I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.	No
32723	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	No
23879	Many would trade for it.	No
33055	First of all, China illegally dumps steel into the United States and Donald Trump buys it to build its buildings, putting American steel mills and steel mills out of business.	Yes
7195	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	Yes
24044	I agree with the President: when they could not, we should have it; now that they can, they should.	No
14401	So I say this is very simple.	No
2526	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.	No
13296	I don't agree with that.	No
21014	We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.	Yes
7875	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - that we gave to all of Africa the previous year.	Yes
3885	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy to go to an area, clearing and held, and the people of the country then become allies with you.	No
10768	The secret of Senator Obama that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenues.	Yes
7952	In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.	No
15673	But what I don't like is this left-wing political agenda and so I have to help define it and if he doesn't want to, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	No
13366	Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	Yes
28186	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	No
1249	Because of the people living in the suburbs, better education, better organization, greater articulation, greater knowledge of what laws are, this money has often been channelled from the centres of the city centre where it is needed.	No
26530	A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	No
18218	America needed to be safe.	No
1042	I think the American people are too.	No
8618	And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	No
8905	I think the government has a responsibility to find jobs for young people in this country, and the place to start is to help the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	No
16140	That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	No
28240	We have a big difference between us on this issue.	No
3536	And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	No
11131	We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	No
21510	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	No
13592	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	Yes
6844	We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	No
11737	And as for the idea of building a nation, the sentence seems grand.	No
28538	But let me tell you my position on weapons in general, sir, if you don't mind.	No
3938	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	Yes
20551	And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	No
1893	Bill Clinton tried the approach I'm talking about.	No
29220	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	No
19570	You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	Yes
16945	I think that the problem should have been solved by increasing productivity, by putting people at work so that they could buy more goods, reduce personal income taxes, perhaps increase them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	No
24698	Costs will continue to increase.	No
22858	He was deceiving the inspectors.	Yes
18365	And I do not appreciate a presidential candidate denouncing the contribution of these brave soldiers.	No
9053	Which we must reduce.	No
13133	Admiral Yarnell, commander of the Asian fleet, said these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	Yes
32483	And I'm gonna tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, guys.	Yes
33593	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	No
20341	According to the governor's plan, if you kept the same service fees as those you now have under Medicare, your premiums would increase from 18% to 47%, and this is the study of the plan of Congress on which he shaped his proposal by the Actuaries of Medicare.	Yes
3786	So stay here and after eight years and say you're going to lead on spending control and, you know, balance our tax cuts so they help middle-class families when over the last eight years that haven't arrived I think just, you know, is a little hard to swallow.	Yes
7159	"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."	Yes
5523	Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we need to help the owners.	No
16068	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	No
11449	This means not only military strength and our values, but also the maintenance of our economy.	No
23305	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	No
14910	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	Yes
4405	That's where I got my name.	No
19757	I'd like to have a big, organized summit, but these people were killing innocent Arab children, innocent Israelis, and they were dying.	Yes
16091	So I don't think we have to do what you suggested here.	No
21740	So why pass a law that won't fix it?	No
12628	Do people want to be identified with us?	No
21167	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	No
3076	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	Yes
3294	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	Yes
19376	So I just want to try to fix it as it goes.	No
17528	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	No
26575	I would be ready to have another debate this year.	No
14711	More people work harder for less, 100,000 people a month lose their health insurance, unemployment increases, our economy slows down.	Yes
1280	You know, I'm sure, the recognition given in the Air Force to General James, and there was just a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the U.S. Navy, so we pay full tribute to the quality people in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	Yes
21315	If people send me to Washington, the first thing I'm going to do is study this 2,000-page deal and make sure it's a two-way street.	No
16731	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	No
27910	This will not help us compete with China.	Yes
22893	In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	No
17125	Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.	Yes
499	The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.	No
11045	When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	Yes
15200	And suggesting that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and on the basis of all the previous efforts of two previous presidents, is simply not true.	No
3915	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
27527	And every fact-checker and every journalist who looked at him, Governor, said it wasn't true.	Yes
14876	But I will always remember that the best weapons are those that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is the one who never has to give his life on the battlefield.	No
16371	That is why I am proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	No
27450	It is also essential that we understand what our mission in Iran is, that is, to deter Iran from having a nuclear weapon by peaceful and diplomatic means.	Yes
26629	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	No
22779	And so, what I'm telling you is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	No
3010	It's a matter of strength.	No
1882	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.	Yes
28594	You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	No
19090	First of all, I want to say how much I respect Senator Dole and his public service record and how much I will try to make this campaign and debate ideas and not insults.	No
11802	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	No
30219	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	Yes
1574	And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	No
7090	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	No
25086	As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	No
28934	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves the lives of other people.	No
663	And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	No
310	I hope this is the first and last time I have to say it.	No
3500	President Eisenhower, the day before the Norman invasion, entered his room and wrote two letters.	No
19695	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	No
25714	But that progress is only the beginning.	No
21633	My plan would spend $20 billion a year over the next four years on new investments in transportation, communications, environmental remediation and new technologies for the twenty-first century.	Yes
3221	Let me take South Korea as an example.	No
18446	I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.	Yes
28302	We're in the information age.	No
10832	Senator Obama voted 94 times to increase your taxes or against tax reductions.	Yes
25091	We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	No
27156	You know, one of the challenges of the last decade is that we have been experimenting with nation-building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, and we have neglected, for example, to develop our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	No
6870	He has no record on reforming of health care.	Yes
27668	Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	No
880	When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	No
14750	Now you have to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you have to stop letting these people in the press tell you that you throw your vote away -- you have to start using your own head.	No
25833	But let me say that the American Hospital Association said that the budget that I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	Yes
3327	And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	Yes
22732	I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	No
16389	So let me repeat that I have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his legacy.	No
24377	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	Yes
2340	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	No
25790	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, like George Washington, like Abraham Lincoln did.	No
11193	"We will also have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I made it very clear: ""You will have to do better by your people so that we can get the necessary popular support."""	No
3790	On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.	No
19147	These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	No
24633	Second, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with the FDA, look exactly where we are.	No
34131	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	Yes
7999	Secondly, Mr Nixon continued to declare - and he said it last week - these fantastic figures of what the democratic budget would cost the platform.	No
1456	We have seven and a half million unemployed people.	Yes
17690	One final point if I might.	No
21891	That's how the game is played now.	No
3033	In 1973, when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	Yes
9031	I happen to believe it is.	No
22002	But on all these things, a healthy economy is the only way to get it.	No
23221	That's the way we leave it.	No
33095	I therefore believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there are a lot of things at stake.	No
9020	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted in the House of Representatives against a constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back to public schools.	Yes
3356	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	No
24187	The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	No
20595	As the vice president is.	No
13844	When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	Yes
26255	We should reach out, make sure everyone has a chance to participate.	No
19582	I have proposed many new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	Yes
20136	We are better off than we were four years ago.	No
3543	The first thing we need to do is control spending in Washington.	No
22177	I'd love to, because you can't do it the old-fashioned way.	No
25074	My definition of national force is to make sure that a dollar spent buys us a dollar worth of defense.	No
3300	I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	No
21084	A promise made will be a promise kept.	No
450	I do not favor abortion.	No
4354	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	No
23890	I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	No
17884	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	No
619	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	No
1349	It's the people who should be in jail.	No
17122	We were told that we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	Yes
28081	The HMOs and insurance companies support the other pending bill, the one that the Republican majority has introduced.	Yes
33830	And I think it's his campaign.	No
6391	The policies of the last eight years and Washington's reluctance to tackle the difficult problems of decades have left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
13317	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	No
10187	And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	No
25038	To do this, a president must know what is essential to command, lead and strengthen.	No
24438	The United States should try to work with its allies and stop it.	No
17318	And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	No
15555	And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	No
17968	I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	No
21203	I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	No
13762	I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.	No
22589	And that sends a confusing signal to people.	No
27709	In Egypt, we were on the side of democracy.	Yes
20308	Then you go to your own pharmacy.	No
16622	I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	Yes
22140	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	Yes
26570	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	No
21401	We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	Yes
9761	We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	Yes
5538	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket that would increase his taxes, which would make him not be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to achieve the American dream.	No
2424	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	Yes
21394	So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	No
18213	We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	Yes
1579	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, every woman and every child - on health care.	Yes
19178	It inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 per cent, now it has fallen to about 2.4 per cent.	Yes
19428	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	Yes
17309	Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	No
15756	That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.	No
12199	The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	No
28828	Because we are able to take advantage of the wisdom and experience of different parts of society that had not been exploited in the same way before.	No
28661	I think if you're going to get tax relief, everyone's taking advantage of it.	No
28747	Because I think that special interests have too much power, and we must return our democracy to the American people.	No
24561	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	No
6324	That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	No
11449	That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	No
15223	Today we imported 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date a year ago.	Yes
15210	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	No
635	But I know that we have serious financial problems in this country.	No
6741	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	No
24054	But two former defence secretaries recently released a report saying that 100,000, or a little less, soldiers would suffice, including President Reagan's former defence secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	Yes
12828	Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	No
25918	The last thing we want to do is engage more forces anywhere.	No
12873	Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	No
21817	I think you need to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	No
22762	I -- listen, I -- we have a big country.	No
28614	We need to open up markets.	No
31906	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	No
19828	I do not blame the president or vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	No
19499	Let's stop playing the political game, Mr. President.	No
7309	And I would have taken him to the country and I would have had all the law enforcement officers in the country visit these deputies.	Yes
30035	It is -- it is a huge problem.	No
12921	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.	No
9010	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	No
136	It's not gonna cost the government money.	No
6368	Well, thank you again, Bob.	No
23500	A lot of people in America are concerned about how the Patriot Act has been enforced.	No
20117	Let's take these four years in a row.	No
33536	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	No
27267	New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	Yes
8664	Let me tell you that I am opposed to a tax reduction for the election year, whether it is the 10% tax reduction promised to taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or the $27.5 billion tax reduction promised by President Carter on August 20.	Yes
34053	Well, Chris, let me answer that, because it's horrible.	No
33527	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	No
12355	Oh, you mean the rules.	No
30053	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	No
19450	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	No
3363	I think we can and should do it.	No
13117	It only stimulates their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	No
17155	I will never represent a reduction in social security benefits for those who receive them today.	No
766	This is a very serious accusation against the President.	No
13734	Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	Yes
1577	We have never increased sales taxes, income tax or property tax.	Yes
27972	We have the opportunity to have real leadership.	No
17715	Well, it isn't going to go back up.	No
28186	I do not want the federal government to make decisions on behalf of everyone.	No
29655	And we need to be very clear about that.	No
7497	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	No
462	And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	No
12709	The great struggle will be to prevent Castro's influence from spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	No
33064	We've got to remain energy-independent.	No
1345	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	No
18195	Anyway, it's for another debate.	No
7745	It's a prestige test.	No
32549	Just like Warren Buffett and George Soros and many other people Hillary receives money.	Yes
3766	If we're lucky and we're doing it right, it could happen, but in the short term, there's an expense and we might not see that money for a while.	No
28201	We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	No
24696	The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	Yes
27560	And they can look at my background, if it's Iranian sanctions, if it's a fight against terrorism, if it's about supporting democracy, if it's about supporting women's rights, if it's about supporting religious minorities.	No
10775	And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.	No
29598	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, many friends of me who know my business say, boy, it's really not a lot of money.	No
15326	In the past, the relationship between social security and health insurance has been very important in providing modest support to the elderly in maintaining health benefits.	No
14750	Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.	No
1877	He's in electronics in St. Louis.	No
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
16381	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on November 8 so that we can move forward in the future.	No
19642	So, we should at least put the facts on the table to find out where to go from here.	No
18302	And from the beginning, I voted to give authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I accepted that information.	Yes
34207	And if you think you're going to Mosul after we let the world know that we're going in, and all the people we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	No
16021	George Bush, a few years ago, said that social security was basically a social protection system.	Yes
19475	There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	Yes
25216	"And then five days before the troops were killed, they returned to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, get these troops out of there because we cannot defend them."""	Yes
29666	And that's what I do.	No
2199	The AARP believes that the savings we have obtained from Medicare strengthen the system, extending the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	Yes
24207	Until we control the costs of health care, we will not control the deficit.	No
18394	And our alliance is strong.	No
9608	We have expanded Pell grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, across the country.	Yes
22338	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	No
34296	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	No
27790	They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	Yes
19661	So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	No
11890	And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	No
12328	What are we going to tell our children?	No
21347	Stress and subsidize here the modernization of facilities and equipment, not the relocation of facilities abroad.	No
15283	In the case of offshore oil, only 2% are now leased and produce oil.	Yes
7690	Secondly, as an executive leader.	No
28981	I'm sure your Grade 6 students are listening and saying, these guys are going to say everything to be elected.	No
24194	And finally in this period of 90 days before the inauguration, set up the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas gift.	No
17800	Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	Yes
7709	I mean, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	No
7642	We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	No
33254	Donald said he was in favour of a disfinancing of the Parenthood Planning.	Yes
27800	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	Yes
333	I want the McKinney Act to be fully funded.	No
28987	And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	Yes
26645	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	No
14368	That's what I'll do as president.	No
641	But these are the choices that the next President of the United States will have to make.	No
27513	And I think that when the President said that he was going to create the light of day between us and Israel, they also noticed that.	No
18243	We're with you strong.	No
33233	I am therefore very honoured with all this.	No
17863	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	Yes
27892	They would have gone through a...	No
21792	If you want to hear it, you'll have it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	No
22885	The all- volunteer army works.	No
8576	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we see that the United States is even ahead of 20 years ago.	Yes
15267	I suggest that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade all facets of business, and indeed much of our personal life, that are useless; that the government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that contribute their share to inflation.	Yes
13126	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	No
5653	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	Yes
3904	We need more troops there.	No
11821	We must therefore do everything in our power to put an end to racial profiling.	No
9483	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	Yes
19591	When we worked hard to end the North Korean nuclear threat.	No
23482	Actually, I wouldn't support him if I thought so.	No
16793	Nearly a thousand raised their hands.	Yes
10638	I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	Yes
8143	I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	No
25227	A president must lead his government or it will not be done.	No
18765	I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	No
19963	They all have a lot of anxiety over there.	No
19405	Overall, in America, cocaine use has dropped by 30 per cent over the past four years, occasional drug use has decreased by 13 per cent.	Yes
26462	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	No
5850	I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	No
7830	Secondly, in addition to that, if we enter a period of recession, we should move on to the part of the economy represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulating that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	No
17997	Free nations will respond to the hopes and aspirations of their people.	No
69	Values start at the top, at the White House.	No
16390	But we have huge differences.	No
33825	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying they're violent, causing fighting, doing bad things.	Yes
27218	I also think that taking our missile defence programme out of Poland in the way we did was also regrettable in terms, if you wish, to disrupt the relationship in a certain way that existed between us.	No
15492	But we also have to deal with the prevention of drug education here at home.	No
21227	I also want to go to Washington to do positive things.	No
11216	A long time ago, I warned Vladimir Putin.	No
2024	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	No
435	And I think it must be the woman, in the exercise of her conscience and religious beliefs, who makes this decision.	No
8874	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.	Yes
8162	I want us to recapture that image.	No
7863	It's a problem between Mr. Nixon and me.	No
25504	And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.	Yes
25538	And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.	No
8852	But where are we going to find the money the federal government is putting in place to help them?	No
22193	We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	No
27809	This is the kind of leadership we will continue to show.	No
10648	And I supported those and I know how to repair this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year abroad.	Yes
15321	I'd like to change that.	No
10450	But it's only one step.	No
11012	Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	Yes
28367	If you pay taxes, you should get tax relief.	No
17747	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	No
8917	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	Yes
14894	The average was about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
23306	As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	Yes
27822	And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	Yes
2203	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	Yes
29857	I'd just like to respond.	No
25632	We know nothing about them.	No
17751	And it's not personal -- there are profound differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	No
29192	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	No
24269	We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	Yes
34338	So we have to use our great people.	No
1962	This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.	No
15150	It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.	Yes
18256	When I was in a rope the other day, coming from Wisconsin, a few young returnees were in the rope, an active duty, a duty of the Guard.	No
3153	I also recommended that we stop the sale by Germany and France of processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
12808	But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	No
26409	Reduce the economy, reduce the rate of capital gains, create more jobs and opportunities for everyone in America.	No
7593	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	No
19968	That's what our message is to people watching.	No
2873	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	Yes
2965	As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	No
7819	Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.	Yes
291	"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."	No
14314	And we got some very good Republican women running.	Yes
658	You should say it's good.	No
5566	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth.	No
19745	Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	No
15109	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	No
26082	I met that woman again.	No
21347	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	No
209	That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.	No
15247	But 32 of them have abandoned and cancelled their construction plans, and again, because government regulations and permits, and so on, take - take - more than twice as much time to build a nuclear power plant in the United States as it does to build a power plant in Japan or Western Europe.	Yes
25746	There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	No
3873	I was honored to speak to those troops.	No
28457	So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	No
24184	You have nowhere to sleep.	No
2875	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	Yes
25781	I know you do.	No
27363	We need to think about cybersecurity.	No
27259	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put parents and teachers and children first, and teachers' unions are going to have to fall behind.	No
7520	And it's a painting from western Texas, a picture from a mountain scene.	No
6498	"Six months after saying that Osama bin Laden was to be arrested dead or alive, the president was asked: ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	No
11359	I know what it's like to have your comrades contact you, your neighbours and your fellow citizens, and come and pick you up and get back into action.	No
19424	But it seems to me that the file is clear.	No
546	We got rid of values and fundamentals.	No
24637	And we could move to the human population much faster than we do with some of these new drugs.	No
23129	Let me see where to start here.	No
18745	I believe that the United States should have offered the opportunity to supply nuclear fuel, to test it, to see whether or not it was for peaceful purposes.	No
27070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly at this time.	No
11043	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
28808	I think we can do this in a way that represents what America is, that is, equal opportunities and the possibility for people to realize their potential.	No
14297	You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	No
18533	I will never let these troops fall, and I will hunt down and kill terrorists wherever they are.	No
26675	It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	No
23975	I would like to create more millionaires than those created under Mr Bush and Mr Reagan, but I do not want to be four years old when we have no growth in the private sector, and that is what has happened in the last four years.	Yes
28235	Instead of just coming the mild fanaticism of low expectations, that there must be a consequence.	No
19374	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	No
26432	You may think America's biggest employer is General Motors, but I have news for you.	No
14949	Most people, when they think about reducing government spending, think about eliminating the necessary programs or eliminating something, some of the services that the government is supposed to offer.	No
8399	Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	No
10155	What was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know exactly, where thousands of automatic and AK-47 weapons were - were given to people who eventually gave them - to the drug lords.	Yes
16573	In fact - now - I do not plead for amnesty; I plead for forgiveness.	No
19743	But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	No
20657	The mission is to fight and win the war and thus prevent the war from occurring in the first place.	No
9447	'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.	No
23643	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed into life.	No
29889	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	Yes
4109	But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.	No
20625	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	No
9808	He said he was going to cut the deficit by half.	No
50	I say that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a particular responsibility, not only to design programs, and I have described in detail the very important, very strong enforcement program and prevention of drug awareness.	No
8216	And I think, first of all, that our own file proves that we know the way.	No
1579	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	Yes
10829	There are too many special interests and lobbyists working on it.	No
19528	But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	Yes
403	I think the governor is jamming homes and homeless people.	No
22454	Now that will change America.	No
22103	I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	No
25719	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.	No
17010	We need a president who can enter - who pulls his strength from the people.	No
34251	We gave them $150 billion back.	Yes
21632	But let me tell you exactly what my plan is doing.	No
27870	And that we do these things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, companies to develop.	No
7176	What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	No
6618	We are talking about tax issues.	No
3160	We have to stop this.	No
18804	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	No
23823	This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	No
13612	Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.	Yes
17180	Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	Yes
2720	And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	No
18732	And I think it's gonna work.	No
1816	I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	No
15402	So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.	No
12739	I would like to point out that when we look at our programmes in Latin America, we find that we have allocated five times more for Latin America than it had been for the previous administration; we see that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America of only one billion dollars; we have the new program that was presented at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower presented, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	Yes
16005	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	No
34130	They want to look good.	No
12854	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	No
20694	We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	No
19205	We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.	Yes
14564	Now I'll tell you that.	No
9055	We must, in our inability to protect our national security as it is today, not be provocative towards a possible adversary.	No
20503	As for the drug itself, I mentioned that I was disappointed.	No
12518	Who threatens freedom in the world?	No
16858	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	Yes
25851	And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.	No
27300	And our eighth grade students number one in English and also in math.	Yes
27530	So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	No
13252	With regard to U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have supported the President's position throughout this period.	Yes
18038	And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	No
17023	Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	Yes
15168	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
33	And I have proposed a multi-point drug program that includes what I would do as President of the United States, in terms of doing better in terms of bans, and better in terms of neighbourhoods.	No
18152	First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to allow the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time in the wrong place.	Yes
18187	And there is an enormous amount of untied work to protect the cowardly nuclear materials in the world that are able to reach terrorists.	No
7917	Before we enter the summit, before we meet again, I think it is important for the United States to build its own strength, its military force and its own economic force.	No
8992	But whether I agree or disagree with an individual, or what he can say, or how he can say it, I don't think there's any way to suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, they shouldn't want to reflect these people and the causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles that we have so abandoned in this country.	No
6250	"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health."""	No
3829	And we did not use our army wisely in Iraq.	No
11493	Sanctions are being violated.	Yes
2877	Now we went to South Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many years.	No
32784	When I go there for a second, it's like a big deal.	No
6320	Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	No
10925	It's breaking family budgets.	No
24532	I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	No
1296	Bankruptcy has gone up to an extraordinary degree.	Yes
22018	But that's the election.	No
17303	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	No
1210	As president, I have increased funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution, by more than 60%.	Yes
6628	And so the person you've been talking to, I say, here's some help, here's trade adjustment help for you to go to a community college in your neighbourhood, a community college that provides the skills needed to fill 21st century jobs.	No
32813	She's not getting away with it.	No
7459	"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	No
13192	That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	Yes
4209	He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	Yes
24265	These interest rates we have now make no sense.	No
21082	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	Yes
20878	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	No
25323	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	No
14056	The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.	Yes
15165	Unemployment, cities are all very important issues, but they are of little importance in the life and duties of a president in relation to the control of nuclear weapons.	No
33501	I think it's quite...	No
2595	We know that the path we are taking is not working.	No
28955	We both made promises in this campaign.	No
19342	That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	Yes
226	Let me talk about AIDS.	No
33653	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	No
17803	That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.	No
14011	I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.	No
33460	They have no idea where they came from.	Yes
13811	And all you hear is how bad things are.	No
18939	I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
15970	In other states, we have done so.	Yes
5492	They hurt, and they're angry.	No
17448	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it is a problem of the Constitution.	No
30041	And maybe it's hardly doable.	No
33886	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	Yes
18142	More in July than June.	Yes
1781	Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	Yes
25505	And then, as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinists avoided the other parties of the revolution.	Yes
15555	And so what I want to do is continue this expansion.	No
26119	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	Yes
26092	$500 per child under 18.	Yes
20262	I take him for his word.	No
3189	The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.	No
8406	That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.	No
33854	Donald thinks betraying women makes him bigger.	No
6984	He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.	Yes
23439	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	No
16778	Well, this bill has not yet arrived at the Oval Office, so I'm not in a position to make a judgment on it tonight.	Yes
12730	I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	No
2494	But it's already the law and it doesn't help millions of people who have pre-existing conditions.	Yes
13972	Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	Yes
9389	I'm all about oil production.	No
28081	The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.	Yes
22246	You pay for that.	No
26924	Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	No
956	Who has integrity and stability to do the job?ââ€°Â¤ My compatriots, I am this man and I ask for your support.	No
21866	You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.	No
2293	One is that it designates a number of banks as too large to fail, and they are indeed guaranteed by the federal government.	Yes
26537	We'd have that trouble all over America.	No
20108	The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.	No
8948	And that state we controlled spending.	Yes
27059	We made sure they were isolated.	No
19689	We have done so by expanding what is known as the no-fly zone by increasing the control of our allies over the airspace now from the Kuwaiti border to the outskirts of Baghdad.	Yes
23963	So that's where my income cap would be triggered.	No
16629	There is no way to get the answer to a question.	No
20419	It's a problem I know a lot about.	No
153	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	No
16289	It would not have stopped if we had not been ready, the Soviets would not have even started if we had not even been prepared to support the freedom fighters there.	No
23167	What does that mean, do you have a plan?	No
8299	They only have a few buyers who buy their milk or pigs - a few large companies in many cases - and the farmer is therefore not in a position to negotiate very effectively on the market.	No
17401	There are tasks that the government should legitimately enforce and tasks that the government is doing well, and you have named some of them.	No
10769	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	No
6086	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	Yes
25042	I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will publish the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said.	No
22013	It is absolutely essential to bring our banking system and our credit system into the new era instead of reviving it in the dark ages.	No
24631	First of all, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	No
6967	But for our children and grandchildren, we must have a different strategy.	No
16235	Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.	No
8317	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	No
18457	Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.	No
7620	The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	Yes
29329	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	No
21186	And besides, one of them is this one.	No
1224	We have no energy policy.	Yes
679	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	No
7029	He's talking about middle-class tax cuts.	No
20810	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	Yes
15833	And we saw the governor and his son on television the night before, his family and his mother who was there.	No
7786	And I believe that in the cases of India, Africa and Latin America, that is where we should focus.	No
18338	Moreover, he says that the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	Yes
1163	I don't believe it.	No
25623	The meaning of this election is the future and if we will grow and provide jobs and opportunities for all Americans and what they need.	No
12888	First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	No
1144	He served this nation with great skill, courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	No
10735	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	No
18749	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated it under Clinton's presidency.	Yes
14193	101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.	No
19351	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	No
8473	And we were informed when he was put to the vote that if it were adopted, the President of the United States would veto him.	Yes
24475	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	No
7598	No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	No
31939	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	Yes
17133	I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	No
21191	You know, this man has no credibility on this issue.	No
8074	All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.	No
17911	I believe that our future requires a president to lead us in a global search to advance our education, learning, science and training, because this world is more complex and we are ever more in a hurry.	No
15833	And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	No
26538	We need to take care of managed care.	No
28735	I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	No
22145	I'll close on this point.	No
21126	And you know what, the issue is changing.	No
478	I respect his right not to agree with me.	No
7931	Well, I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one in the current economic conditions, it would be desirable to increase taxes.	No
19121	I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .	No
8445	I do not want the federal government to pay teachers' salaries directly.	No
24631	First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	No
2859	The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	No
18614	That is why it is essential to keep the line.	No
1113	The current direction, uh - there's, uh - is pretty uniform for their purpose, and I think it's a close group, uh - and I think it would be imprudent for us to say that we're going to war, uh - in Yugoslavia, uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely improbable thing.	No
16027	The reason why we raise concerns, not only in election years, but every year, because the Republicans, once they are elected and begin to cut.	No
32321	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	Yes
141	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	No
15890	Barb and I lost a child, you know we lost a girl, Robin.	No
365	And I think the housing community is ready.	No
27852	We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	No
1026	First of all, in the case of the Carter administration, the sacrifices would be much less important.	No
27246	The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
19201	First, in February, Senator Dole acknowledged that the U.S. economy had been in the best position in 30 years.	Yes
13190	We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	No
5925	It negotiated with the oil companies and confronted them with a decrease, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that will relieve the energy needs of the United States -- what they call the 48 minus.	Yes
3095	Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.	Yes
1345	If we use a gun in the commission.	No
7172	You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.	No
2093	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	Yes
31933	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	No
3306	I understand that the Department of State and the Department of Defence have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, as well as the National Security Agency.	Yes
11704	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	Yes
21832	I don't want to crash.	No
19653	They're gonna see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	No
16711	Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	Yes
1501	In Georgia alone, for example, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people, in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	Yes
10505	Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	No
8526	I think that if the United States maintains a strong society here in the United States, I think we can face any internal threat.	No
25029	They are a hard and ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet this challenge, and I will.	No
30097	We work with our friends in the Middle East, many of whom, as you know, are Muslim-majority nations.	Yes
30039	He's so good with these computers, it's amazing.	No
8420	I think the reason I voted against the federal government is probably the very reason that Senator Kennedy was concerned about the issue of teachers' salaries when, in January of this year, at his press conference, he said that he preferred assistance in the construction of schools, but at that time, he did not think there would be help for teachers' salaries - at least that's how I read his remarks.	Yes
19197	One works for the family and the other pays taxes for the government.	No
241	We can't just put our head in the sand in terms of testing.	No
18987	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	No
21798	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	No
20773	They earn a combined income of $51,000, they pay about $3,500 in taxes.	Yes
16234	But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.	No
4231	We want to work with the Russians.	No
18834	There's nothing wrong with that.	No
2915	And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	No
387	Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	No
20285	And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	Yes
653	Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	No
32359	Well, I just want to say...	No
5805	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	Yes
29965	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	Yes
17020	A president can't be all things to all people.	No
29669	We're just opening on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there in one way, I'm going to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	No
13921	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	Yes
11919	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	No
32503	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	No
33311	The border -- as you know, the border patrol officers, 16 500 plus ICE last week, approved me.	Yes
34267	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	No
12952	My judgment is that the Republican party stayed here in the United States, and that it also remained around the world.	No
25184	Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	No
17792	Social security therefore has nothing to do with the balance of a budget or the obliteration or reduction of the deficit.	No
16766	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	No
8002	Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	Yes
11027	But after saying that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	No
20154	Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	No
32499	But she's massively raising everyone's taxes.	Yes
15663	And in the process the negatives began.	No
738	They are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	No
6348	But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.	No
22783	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	No
13842	But let's take my life in perspective.	No
10854	I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.	Yes
10828	Let's not let them do it anymore.	No
3696	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	No
25917	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	No
8340	I can only say that.	No
15793	I'm thinking of the class teachers, the class teachers I've had, the class teachers the young people have today and who are true heroes for our young people.	No
13803	This will be my first priority, not my concern for the election year.	No
27926	I've met some of those people.	No
2602	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	No
8173	The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	No
8167	The question now is: can freedom be maintained under the most severe attack it has ever known?	No
1333	And so, they should not be treated lightly.	No
28635	I'm from a big farm state.	No
13908	Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	No
11513	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	No
6831	That is one of the reasons why I firmly believe in what is called health savings accounts.	No
34064	It's a state of mind.	No
22032	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is because they've been frozen.	Yes
16793	About a thousand raised their hands.	Yes
19017	My compatriots, as I said at the very beginning of this debate, President Bush and I love this country very much.	No
1781	Four years ago, when I was on this stage, I said I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	Yes
21225	There is a huge difference of opinion.	No
26565	Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	No
4110	And I am pleased that Senator McCain spoke about the history, the bipartite history of our engagement in direct diplomacy.	No
23929	Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	No
21070	I am opposed to it.	No
7028	I've heard more of the same thing.	No
4280	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to the elimination of this issue of nuclear waste and nuclear fuel that needs to be addressed.	No
22430	I hope I'm that person.	No
488	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is to give as much control as possible to local government and the state.	No
7881	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	No
20571	It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	No
3023	Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	Yes
28879	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	No
22712	He came to see me.	No
11362	I believe in its future.	No
15621	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	No
8970	Some people are looking for numbers, and others are looking for numbers.	No
968	Yes, it is a difficult problem, as Mr Bush says, but it is not an insoluble problem.	No
25231	"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control."	Yes
23730	He wants your kids to pay for it.	No
610	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	No
20960	What was the question?	No
7740	When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	No
18506	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	No
25341	And that is what we are trying to do, not only to protect our own borders, but also to have a kind of fairness and recognition of this problem.	No
33308	We have no country if we have no border.	No
32193	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	No
25069	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	No
22389	I can think of many.	No
22953	Thank you very much, Ann.	No
25077	I'll keep us strong, but you won't unless you command this budget and make sure we get the strength we need.	No
24403	Ann, both are very complicated situations.	No
14301	But look who's with him there.	No
19985	I think the government can do better.	No
3027	He indicates he would not make those.	No
27170	But it's an honor we have.	No
17878	I think the spirit has been restored to the American people.	No
24591	I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.	No
2096	But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	No
17606	I'm talking about the 12.8% he paid, and that's what's happening in this whole country with rich Americans.	Yes
25788	Take them back to public life.	No
3003	We still do not have a comprehensive energy policy in this country.	No
8950	But at the same time, we have returned to the people of California - tax refunds, tax credits, tax reductions - $5.7 billion.	Yes
22219	And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.	No
12667	We want to be stronger.	No
33346	We have 11 million undocumented people.	Yes
26032	Their idea was a budget that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	Yes
5945	That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	No
3264	I would be prepared to continue to increase the payment for the shipment of goods through the Panama Canal area.	No
6629	And that's what I'd say to that person.	No
9941	Instead let people make their own choice.	No
14950	I think there's enough extravagance and fat in the government.	No
17915	The President's record is quite different.	No
22407	May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- whoever can stand between these three characters here and do the work -- we owe her a series of applause.	No
1384	Civil rights - have been confirmed by the Burger Court, have not been reversed, and I do not think there is a tendency to reverse these fundamental decisions.	Yes
435	And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
911	And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	Yes
882	And I didn't choose him because he agreed with me on everything.	No
17217	We believed in a partnership, and it was an example of a partnership between not only the local government and the federal government, but also between the private sector that built this particular structure.	No
11363	I believe in its greatness.	No
15443	I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	No
2002	But you've been... but you've been president for four years...	No
12271	But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.	Yes
21653	It's not bad for a guy who's never been there, is it?	No
8810	These two measures, I think, would respond to the appropriate incentives that we could offer to these people.	No
33638	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	No
33347	They have 4 million U.S. citizen children, 15 million people.	Yes
17451	And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	Yes
34280	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	Yes
34362	Maybe it's because of our experiences.	No
21378	Here's something that'll help.	No
33860	And it's really up to all of us to make it true, now and in the future, and especially for our children and grandchildren.	No
20478	This is the right thing for consumers.	No
12380	And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	No
16385	Thank you, and God bless you.	No
22706	"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	No
24415	Use--work internationally to do it.	No
22654	I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.	No
20313	Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	Yes
6635	This president took a surplus of $5.6 trillion and turned it into a deficit for the eyes.	Yes
2006	Four years later.	No
28896	No, I'm not proud of that.	No
4044	You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	No
24318	We must put an end to this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
25773	We must respect each other.	No
20227	I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	No
19897	But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	Yes
16621	The same will be done at the federal government level.	No
14629	And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	No
24081	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	No
17108	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	Yes
26073	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was tired of seeing people trapped in a system that increasingly isolated them and made their children more vulnerable to trouble.	Yes
17020	A president can't be everything for everyone.	No
23473	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	Yes
12627	Is our strength and prestige rising?	No
13260	Senator Kennedy quotes the record he read a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a vote that I mentioned several times - where he was a minority was a vote that rejected his position.	Yes
33471	And I'll tell you the following: We have very serious problems, because we have a country with a huge number of nuclear warheads -- 1800, by the way -- where they developed and we don't, 1800 nuclear warheads.	Yes
14067	But that's what happens when you sit here today.	No
2562	And hard-pressed states can't all do that.	No
20676	And we're gonna need a new commander-in-chief to rebuild military power.	No
28904	Because I think it saves lives, Leo.	No
26765	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	No
24730	Let me get back to the main point, Sandy.	No
25231	"And a recent book that has just been released by the most respected author of the Nation in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits"", concludes that this president has failed to master the essential details necessary to command us and lead us, both in terms of security and arms control."	Yes
15306	I also noticed in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report from his working group recommends making social security healthier by reducing the adjustment of social security for pensioners in order to offset the impact of inflation.	Yes
25322	And I supported this bill.	Yes
2794	In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.	No
4039	You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.	No
29960	It was very easy to do.	No
32746	... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	Yes
32863	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	No
1530	For twenty-five years, I sat in Congress under five presidents.	No
32183	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	No
16922	And I don't think it's, uh - Congress is Mr Ford's adversary; but if - if he insists - that I am responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I am - have not been a part, then I think it's fair for him to be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	No
19992	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	No
17224	Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.	No
26686	Let me repeat that we have had more than 200 separate trade agreements over the past four years.	Yes
13160	But I would make the effort because I think that the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think that the fate of the world and the future of the human race are involved in preventing a nuclear war.	No
20869	We had a good time.	No
2793	We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	No
11047	One of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put enormous pressure, above all, on our troops, of course, and they have done heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	No
13636	And we are bleeding arterially.	No
18814	We've committed $200 million in aid.	Yes
21165	I want to focus on the results.	No
5846	Well, look, Bob, as I said...	No
17668	I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.	No
20081	The most important thing is that we have the right ideas for the future.	No
26627	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	Yes
25294	We came here to love this nation, to serve it, and it served all our most generous dreams.	No
23304	You looked at me like my clock was up.	No
10582	They're the best -- they're the most -- have the best -- we're the best exporters.	No
19188	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
22974	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	No
16449	There is, uh, an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very succinctly, and that is, to ensure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and work on the other.	No
13764	I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	Yes
26338	I would also like to see the overtime laws change so that we can have more flexible time so that, at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you can decide when you want to take that time, money or on time with your family if you have a family problem.	No
14576	He had just said that Jim Baker was going to be Secretary of State and in the first debate he said no, now he will be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
31842	We will look for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we will try to reach out to all boys and girls, as well as all adults, to get them to work on behalf of our country.	No
19279	So you can get out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	No
1973	This is the biggest cut in the discretionary internal budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	Yes
6666	And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	No
19639	Let me mention that Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.	Yes
24102	I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	No
3846	He raised a whole bunch of them.	No
33325	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	No
26981	Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	No
11027	But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	No
25242	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	No
17893	Do we build the future this nation needs?	No
24687	And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	No
20735	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	No
21094	It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	No
27164	Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.	No
14893	Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.	Yes
13240	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	No
86	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	No
12140	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	Yes
22593	He saw wisdom - until the primary democrat arrived and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to win over him, and he changed his position.	Yes
14432	And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	No
2077	As I mentioned earlier, when you talk about transferring Medicaid to states, we are talking about a 30% reduction over time.	Yes
28507	If it were an expense contest, I'd come in second.	No
8419	I am very pleased that you had this question because, as you know, I came to the last of my other question and was unable to complete the argument.	No
14738	So the question is who will protect this nation, who will protect our people and our children?	No
24448	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	No
20429	I would prefer a million to come from our own hemisphere, from our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	No
16177	I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	No
1384	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	Yes
9074	Do you really think that 8 million Americans who are unemployed and 50% unemployment among young people in our country are acceptable?	Yes
3238	Another thing that I was concerned about was what Mr Ford said about unemployment: - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy unemployment could only be retained when this country was at war.	Yes
13600	Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.	No
28517	If I have the chance to win your trust, the mission of the American army will be to be ready and ready to fight and win the war.	No
18159	Yes, we must be firm and resolved, and I am.	No
26811	President Clinton opposes the limits of mandates, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	Yes
20641	The Vice-President and I have a disagreement on the use of troops.	No
19688	So the right thing to do strategically was to reduce its ability to threaten its neighbours.	No
11999	I think that measures like these are important.	No
15493	And that's one of the things I hope I can personally lead as President of the United States.	No
13819	You have to let small businesses have more incentives.	No
1514	In Korea, we had three million five hundred thousand young men in the army, the navy, the air force and the marines.	Yes
24516	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	No
11571	He's a war criminal charged.	Yes
18078	And I went there hoping that once and for all, the free world would act together to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	No
14188	That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	No
22002	But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	No
18817	We have been very involved in the UN on the Bashir government's sanction policy in Sudan.	Yes
15024	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	Yes
32669	Look what she did in Libya with Gaddafi.	No
34338	So we have to use our great people.	No
22781	Look, there are 30 nations involved in Iraq, about 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	Yes
13892	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	Yes
28220	One of the things the next president must do is remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and soul.	No
26168	I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	No
23246	After September 11, after the end of the recession, the president called for a further tax cut and promised to create 5.6 million jobs.	Yes
13466	I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	Yes
5514	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	Yes
2001	That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	Yes
23720	And it was a risk that -- and that's where we just have a difference of opinion.	No
16719	But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	No
19795	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	No
8879	In addition, employment programs to re-employ young people in our cities would be very high on my list of priorities, both the Youth Opportunities Act 1980 and a $1 billion program that I would recommend put young people at work in energy projects, conservation projects, projects that would achieve some of our country's major national goals.	No
29848	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	No
12439	I'm not the one who's having trouble explaining it.	No
6696	A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	Yes
27979	I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	No
2873	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Ford added a billion and a half dollars.	Yes
959	It was an extraordinary 18 month for Kitty, me and our family.	No
12660	I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.	No
31844	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think that if we work together, if we overcome the division that sometimes puts Americans against each other, and instead, we make great goals -- and I set great goals, by making the economy work for everyone, not just for those at the top, by making sure we have the best education system from kindergarten to university and making it affordable, and many more."	No
4060	Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	No
15448	Is it easier for you to go buy things in stores than four years ago?	No
32013	He owes an apology to the President, he owes an apology to our country, and he must take responsibility for his actions and words.	No
1768	And I'll bring this pipeline from Canada.	No
7286	For me, this is the best way to secure America.	No
18959	That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	No
24987	And I think we may have established a little more understanding.	No
11560	And one of the reasons why I felt so strong that the United States needed to participate was because of our relationship with NATO, and NATO will play an important role in peacekeeping in the future.	No
13015	Not one of them selected a Communist government.	Yes
19964	Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?	No
16447	Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	No
6015	Technology is here and we need to drill now.	No
6464	Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.	Yes
3773	Of course, we have to cut spending.	No
25803	Secondly, we have added one million more children to the ranks of the insured under the Medicaid programme.	Yes
28797	Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	No
29729	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	Yes
25214	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	Yes
17590	Now, I don't think I'm just trying to say that we're taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it doesn't work like that.	No
11885	Is anyone discriminated against?	No
12604	In South Africa of the Sahara, which is the new major section, we have fewer students from all over Africa in this field of study under the auspices of the government today than the country of Thailand.	Yes
2618	When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	No
26225	But I also worked hard to give people a chance to prove they're qualified.	No
3217	And we will do so with the highest moral standards.	No
9174	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	No
22240	Keep in mind that in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we spent $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- $199 billion a year -- and we were at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of academic success.	Yes
18071	The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	No
1511	It tends to distort several times.	No
13423	He suggested that we aid distressed areas.	No
2432	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	Yes
24309	Because they could go back worse than they were.	No
22108	I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	No
27654	And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	No
11995	Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	Yes
2728	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	No
34184	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	No
17518	Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	No
25419	It's harder to defend this nation.	No
17873	I think people should understand that two thirds of the defence budget is paying for salary, or salary and pension.	Yes
16553	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	Yes
24616	"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	No
27059	We have made sure that they are isolated.	No
21885	And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	No
33662	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	Yes
25591	And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	No
23264	I have a tax reduction.	No
16390	But we have enormous differences.	No
13228	I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.	No
24323	And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	No
26616	So we need to preserve the system.	No
1462	There is no way to predict that my family could be able to own a home or take my child to college.	No
11077	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	No
16636	And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	No
1457	Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.	Yes
5971	You do not tell countries that you will unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	No
13152	Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	Yes
24679	-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	No
28767	I think it's the tone.	No
32728	Why can't they make the attack, make a sneaky attack, and after the attack is done, inform the American public that we hit the leaders, we had a huge success?	No
26960	Mali now having northern Mali taken over by Al-Qaida, Syria having continued Assad to -- kill, kill its own people, it is a tumultuous region.	Yes
6208	And that's the kind of judge I want.	No
11038	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	No
27581	I look around the world and I don't think you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar anymore.	Yes
30190	You didn't hear what I said.	No
15410	But, if we talk about what we think about the workers and so on, I'm the only man who ever took this position that was six times president of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	Yes
17845	"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"	No
12121	I want a smaller and smarter government.	No
24103	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	No
30367	You have -- wait a minute.	No
3805	And we will come home with victory and with honor.	No
18495	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	No
33390	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	Yes
18125	And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	No
7807	That is what we must do to reach the world.	No
25599	And above all, I want a strong nation.	No
7757	Now that they're talking about our record here, it's good that they recognize that they also have to defend their record.	No
30404	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latin."	Yes
7810	This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	No
878	We shouldn't do that.Ã¢â€°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	No
22995	I don't think my opponent has the right view of the world to make us safe; I really am not.	No
2900	And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	Yes
360	And when you do that, you have homeless families.	No
16617	But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.	Yes
7651	And here we would give legal power to the Committee on Public Procurement, which is an effective means of achieving real progress in this area, because about one in four jobs is occupied by people who have government contracts and who award them.	Yes
7744	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	No
10447	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	No
10639	Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?	Yes
22417	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	No
8358	I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	No
29786	We need to have more second chance programs.	No
16786	And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	Yes
12561	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not descend to the level of Mr Khrushchev and his colleagues.	No
7886	Let me make my position cl ear.	No
19456	You don't buy a gun.	No
3316	This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	Yes
23873	I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.	No
460	And if we can change this law, everyone should make the extraordinary effort to take these children who are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come at birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	No
8450	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.	No
23857	We must have the courage to change.	No
360	And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	No
23708	That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	No
25040	He's 3 years into this administration.	No
23923	I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.	No
16148	I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.	No
4286	I've got to make this point, Jim.	No
18500	He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.	No
24271	Every time our interest rates rise by one percent, it adds $28 billion to the deficit or debt.	Yes
18521	And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	No
1757	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	No
34318	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	Yes
25557	Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	No
505	Well, I had to live eight different years while the vice president lived, because this administration cut, cut and cut programs for children, for nutrition, for the kind of things that can help these young people live better.	Yes
27248	I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	No
26507	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to maintain it in this way.	No
5731	So the fact is that sometimes I've been wrong about your policies for George Bush's policies is because on the fundamental economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you've been a strong supporter of President Bush.	Yes
22968	I'm going to change that.	No
14419	In 1988, when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had treated him because he was against Iran - the enemy of my enemy may be my friend.	Yes
5543	That's 16 million jobs in America.	Yes
14144	In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	No
3688	They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	Yes
19650	The President was opposed to it in 1993.	Yes
29620	And that's really a shame.	No
19467	They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.	Yes
17727	That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	No
8687	But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	No
3950	Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	Yes
34430	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	No
29645	He gave us a good middle-class life, but the people he worked for, he expected the market to be held on both sides.	No
19320	How does he avoid conflict?	No
3285	And let me make another observation.	No
32629	But I would like to stress that what is at stake here is Russia's ambitions and aggressiveness.	No
34251	We gave them $150 billion.	Yes
11047	So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	No
26667	In the end, we must stop exporting jobs here.	No
32911	She said she was awake at 3:00 in the morning, and she also tweeted at 3:00 in the morning, but I won't even mention it.	No
14518	Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.	No
3587	I have fought against it my career.	No
33161	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everyone.	No
19979	You have a relative who works for the government, the other who works for the family.	No
27468	I would also ensure that their diplomats are treated as the pariahs they are all over the world.	No
13714	We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	Yes
30219	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got an agreement that threw a kick at Iran's nuclear program without a single blow.	Yes
30046	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	No
16000	It was not created as a social assistance program.	Yes
21500	We'll have a debate in four days and we can talk about this character thing again.	No
32401	It was a great -- I thought there was a great demonstration of presidential leadership.	No
11225	We must make it clear to the Russians that there are sanctions for this kind of behaviour, this kind of naked aggression in Georgia, a small country and a small democracy.	No
32776	So I think that could help.	No
6797	And that's what we need -- I think it's the public service test.	No
15808	I'm thinking of the people who brought us back to space, Rick Houk and this crew, like people who are worthy of it.	No
18437	And we know that further diplomatic efforts are under way.	No
8212	But, as this record is, may I point out that this is not enough.	No
24259	So Governor Clinton can label it for the rich or whatever he wants.	No
10156	They used these weapons against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	Yes
12807	If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	No
12610	We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	No
28324	We must have responsibility.	No
6863	That's a big part of your 17 percent increase in health insurance premiums.	Yes
11571	He is an indicted war criminal.	Yes
24274	Just think in your own business, if you've had all your long-term problems funded in the short term.	No
26477	We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	Yes
15236	The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	Yes
27152	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their children go to a good school.	No
15784	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	No
19833	It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	No
22812	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, sir."	No
13095	But I say that any statement that the Republican party is happy to trigger is denied by the file.	No
28504	The governor proposes $45 billion.	Yes
29155	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	No
23140	Secondly, he says that the costs of medical responsibility are only increasing by 1%.	Yes
6053	And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	No
24282	I have numbers 1 and 1A.	No
14896	The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	Yes
8143	I know there are those who want to hand everything over to the government.	No
3341	One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	Yes
17851	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	No
12685	Now I do not know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose Castro's regime, both in Cuba and outside.	No
24411	I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	Yes
17273	I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	No
24536	First of all, we should avoid more of this in the street.	No
7974	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	No
19744	It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.	No
13908	Everyone's snacking around the edges.	No
10674	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	No
34214	Which is a big mistake.	No
18854	I'm trying to put a leash on them.	No
27454	You're seeing it right now in the economy.	Yes
19443	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	No
13106	I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	Yes
33362	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	No
23857	We have got to have the courage to change.	No
17630	I gave you back some of that time.	No
9713	I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	No
19217	We're asking people watching tonight, are you better than you were four years ago.	No
10507	The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.	No
15522	If we had listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	No
4132	And -- and I just -- so I just have to point out that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's advisors all think it's important, and Senator McCain seems resilient.	No
8156	I think we will have to do a better job if we are to assume the responsibilities that time and events have given us.	No
12695	We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.	Yes
6571	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by restoring what President Bush has taken away, which is called salary as you leave.	No
25512	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	No
27281	And these teachers can make a difference.	No
17161	I have fought for social security and health insurance and for things to help vulnerable people all my life, and I will do so as President of the United States.	No
19424	But it seems to me the record is clear.	No
28144	You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.	No
13082	I have repeatedly stated that the United States must respect its commitment in Berlin.	No
21009	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	No
14934	We have inflation because the government is living too well.	No
11679	But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	No
12672	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we are determined in our free country to be the first - not the first if, and not the first but, not the first when - but the first.	No
23500	A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	No
21454	First of all, I believe that character is part of the Presidency.	No
14565	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
21611	But there's going to be a new Congress.	No
22164	We must be the strongest economic power in the world.	No
18193	I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	No
17387	This has barely kept up with - although it has done much - with the huge tax increase imposed in 1977.	Yes
1033	"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	No
16638	Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	Yes
18270	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	No
18641	Libya has understood that America and others will apply doctrine and that the world is better for it.	No
9016	I do not believe in trying to legislate on new tests for the selection of the federal judiciary.	No
27080	We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.	No
16844	Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	Yes
27488	And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	No
24850	Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.	No
7719	Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	No
1189	I don't think that's a good way to describe aayuh-President of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who's been fighting for his country for 35 years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on this.	No
7771	A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	Yes
16063	I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	No
11650	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	No
17860	In 1980 or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 higher than the poverty line, which may explain why there are still numbers in poverty.	Yes
7826	If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	No
14438	Come on, that's not leadership.	No
26686	Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	Yes
22049	They just write a note for the interest.	No
32825	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	No
32598	Four hundred bills bear my name as sponsor or co-author when I was a senator for eight years.	Yes
25292	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	No
206	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	Yes
24243	I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	No
32580	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	No
6739	The reason I did it was because I was worried that the judges activists actually define the definition of marriage, and the safest way to protect marriage between a man and a woman is to amend the Constitution.	No
5507	We ought to put the homeowners first.	No
12998	America has not remained motionless.	No
29304	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	No
17039	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	No
9450	Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.	Yes
11323	My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	No
13459	If we did not certainly have an exhaustion allowance of, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	No
26655	We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	Yes
24579	If the American people cannot be brought together, we cannot turn this country around.	No
14037	I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.	No
17275	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian pastor.	No
26068	It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	Yes
2393	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	No
23440	I proposed one to Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore environmentally friendly ways for coal - to use coal and gas.	Yes
27632	They will have more than Britain in the relatively near future.	No
11952	I can tell you that I am someone who respects others.	No
13630	I want to do something about it.	No
29783	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	No
27010	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	No
21605	And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.	No
28754	We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	No
3257	Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.	Yes
17601	With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.	No
26003	Let's talk about them separately.	No
13363	Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	Yes
24345	And we are helping democracy, Ross.	No
3188	What is more moral in foreign policy than the administration to lead the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974, when the United States committed six million tons of food - more than 60 per cent of the food committed to the world's disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations?	Yes
28092	And I believe I can.	No
17278	Whether it helps or not, I don't know.	No
13986	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and continue your business, trying to serve the American people.	No
17575	You know, I wasn't gonna say that at all, but I can't help it.	No
32669	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	No
17807	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	No
13869	So I think Mr. Perot was right to question management practices.	No
25220	This is the fourth time that this has happened - an identical attack in the same region, despite the warnings - even public - of terrorists.	Yes
16464	We can do this by reducing federal taxes, as I proposed about a year ago, when I asked for a tax reduction of $28 billion, three-quarters of them for private taxpayers and one-quarter for the business sector.	Yes
20231	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	Yes
17720	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	No
31846	That is why I hope that we will meet in this campaign.	No
3654	You need to look at our files.	No
28616	I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	No
9217	And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	No
16078	Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.	No
22793	General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	Yes
15435	And I think they should remember that a vote can make a lot of difference.	No
25517	And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	No
30058	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	No
32306	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	Yes
6293	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	No
21321	We have to stop him.	No
27811	But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	Yes
25285	This is the party that requires employers to determine an employee's citizenship before they are hired.	No
23593	I don't think we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	No
1209	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of the environment.	No
20859	Each school and school district, each state must test the children.	No
26540	It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	No
24447	America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	No
34078	...it just shows you're not up to it.	No
22841	We were safer before President Bush took office.	No
34116	Now we're still fighting to get Mosul.	Yes
23566	I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	No
19558	We must determine when our interests are at stake, not the interests of the United Nations.	No
25179	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	No
8084	He defended strong foreign policy and strong national defence, and therefore produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	No
1484	This is not exactly an exact description of what happened.	No
7997	And in many cases, they don't have adequate shelter.	No
25350	But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	Yes
22184	And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	No
19961	And so I think you take a look at it.	No
12870	They are now engaged in a debate on whether war is the way to communicate the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and everything else.	No
1823	There are six other studies that looked at the study you're describing and that say it's completely wrong.	Yes
17645	It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.	Yes
3011	It is a matter of coherence.	No
14629	And it'll be fun if we all work together to do it.	No
17793	Now, once again, to know if I depend on magic, I think I spoke in clear economic terms about a recovery program that I was told was not working.	No
29376	But the regulations, you're going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	No
27825	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	Yes
18064	The president has moved the troops, so he has 10 times more troops in Iraq than in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	Yes
27754	How strong is our economy?	No
2874	Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.	Yes
27285	And if we have mathematics teachers who can provide the kind of support they need for our children, that's what will determine whether new businesses are created here or not.	No
3971	And we will have to help the Pakistanis to go to these areas and get the allegiance of the people.	No
1584	Employment should be restored for our people.	No
16691	In the last two years alone, we have a total deficit of $120 billion under President Ford and, at the same time, we have had, over the last eight years, a doubling of the number of bankruptcies for small businesses: we have had a negative growth of our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	Yes
24729	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	No
26424	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	No
20008	Everyone who looked at him, 500 economists, seven Nobel laureates, say it's bad for the economy.	Yes
513	Being haunted, a thousand points of light, I don't know what that means.	No
16732	And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	Yes
29622	Our country has tremendous problems.	No
1130	And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.	No
19159	I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.	No
574	I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	Yes
17830	No, as long as I go...	No
12728	The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	No
20050	See, if I say anything, it's gonna be misinterpreted.	No
8166	I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.	No
8968	And I think the numbers he gave are simply not going to rise.	No
16687	We have 500,000 more Americans than three months ago and since Mr Ford has been in the office for two years, we have seen a 50% increase in unemployment, from five million unemployed people to two and a half million more unemployed people and a total of seven and a half million.	Yes
29610	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	No
13543	We have certainly talked, I know, about whether we should be retired or defeated.	No
23029	Just want to make sure they're safe.	No
897	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	No
19037	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	No
29584	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for it.	No
2617	But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	Yes
19466	The administration says they support the instant check.	Yes
7803	We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.	No
17155	I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.	No
16926	And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	No
25974	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	No
21398	I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	No
22623	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	Yes
27142	No, I don't, because I think America must stand up to democracy.	No
24850	All parents are much less afraid that their children will face the nuclear holocaust.	No
19930	Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	No
15341	I think this debate on social security, health insurance, national health insurance, like any other subject this evening, illustrates the fundamental historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.	No
2945	Shortly after my assumption of the presidency in December 1974, I met Secretary-General Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed on a mutual capping of ballistic missile launchers to a ceiling of twenty-four hundred, which means that the Soviet Union, if it becomes a permanent agreement, will have to reduce their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	Yes
679	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	No
30174	I was against the war.	Yes
6875	I was deeply concerned that seniors should choose between prescription drugs and food.	No
1542	What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.	No
8223	We are in favour of programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give all Americans equal opportunities for education, for all things that are necessary and dear to the heart of our people.	No
15767	The governor speaks of limits, which we cannot do, opposes these two systems of modernization, speaks now of good, we will develop a new type of missile.	No
20205	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	No
33884	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	Yes
33193	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	No
28934	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	No
326	Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	No
15048	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	No
2075	And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	No
3147	He learned about the expiry date of SALT I, apparently.	No
24439	I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	Yes
3280	The White House has not prevented the publication of this report.	Yes
20412	Because when we sell these new products here, we can then sell them abroad.	No
28469	In Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the Chamber's Intelligence Committee and worked hard to learn about nuclear arms control and how we can address these tensions and address non-proliferation and the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
18962	And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	No
15251	To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.	No
27105	But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	Yes
4283	What I said was that we need to store it safely.	No
17201	First of all, I think you must have some principles in which you believe.	No
25687	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	No
16604	The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	No
34433	I'm going to defend families against powerful interests, against societies.	No
32808	But she's lied about a lot of things.	Yes
26677	They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	No
32865	I want to be the best president I can be for all Americans.	No
26077	Now I have a plan with this new welfare reform bill to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people out of social assistance, and to do other things that will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from social assistance to work.	No
8942	If you have a child who is extravagant, you can give him a course on his extravagance.	No
9611	And therefore, we have seen millions of young people being able to afford to go to university, and this will ensure that young women will be able to compete in this market.	Yes
305	I question his judgment on these issues, or where he comes from He has the right to do so.	No
9809	He hasn't done that either.	No
29781	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	Yes
6324	They were good people, Senator Obama.	No
4253	And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
17852	I promised a new beginning.	No
8082	The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.	No
25015	That is where I think the future of the world lies.	No
19367	And I've had a constant record since 1965.	Yes
18468	I think what is misleading is to say that you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you continue to change your positions on this war.	No
617	Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	No
2497	It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	Yes
29296	Incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
16341	I hope that I will do a good job as a person who has had a relatively clean file and who has no conflict of interest in his or her own public life, as well as the Governor, to urge young people to join the public service.	No
6583	They have just passed an expansion of this loophole in recent days: $43 billion in donations, including favors to the oil and gas industry and importers of ceiling fans from China.	Yes
7071	They're coming here to work.	No
20122	In fact, there are more people in the government, except in defence-related jobs.	Yes
20293	But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	No
26716	Why should they be rifling through your files?	No
26693	I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.	No
29393	... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	Yes
33481	It's pretty clear you won't admit...	No
19570	You know, the president said he was going to cut the defense 60 billion dollars, he cut the defense 112 billion dollars.	Yes
18920	And that is why proliferation is one of the cornerstones of a multi-pronged strategy to make the country safer.	No
181	More Americans at work today than at any time in history, a higher percentage of the workforce.	Yes
8958	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	No
6845	People tell me that when health care is fully integrated into information technology, it will cost about 20% of the cost of the system.	No
14592	My problem is, I heard what he said.	No
2009	If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	Yes
9248	That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	Yes
4038	"At one point, as you focused on Iraq, you said that we can ""cross"" Afghanistan."	Yes
27148	It's a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if it turns out.	No
324	I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	No
17532	Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.	Yes
15772	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	Yes
25639	"Will we do what we know we must do and know that one day, in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say: ""Thank God for these people in the 1980s for preserving our freedom, for saving us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its greatness and beauty."""	No
14818	I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	No
13716	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	Yes
3210	He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	Yes
12316	I think we need to be fairer, because 99 senators -- I think 99 senators have supported that position.	Yes
19273	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a few kids, a family that works, it's four or five months of daycare, maybe a personal computer; it can be three or four months of mortgage payments.	No
20680	It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	No
8797	As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	Yes
26428	We have a good, stable economic policy.	No
3347	I would never normalize relations with Vietnam, and I would not allow them to join the United Nations until they take this step.	No
22230	Full funding for the Head Start program would cost about $5 billion more.	Yes
1563	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	No
25074	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	No
18723	Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	Yes
21196	This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	Yes
21817	I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	No
8545	Too often, to assess whether we are moving forward or not, we only think about what the federal government is doing.	No
5983	And that is the most important issue our future economy will face.	No
17811	But as a democrat, I was a real thug, Mr. President.	No
28418	You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.	No
14390	I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	No
6254	But this does not mean that we will stop protecting the rights of unborn people.	No
728	I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	No
20042	I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	No
650	What I think we should do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep your eyes open.	No
12627	Are our strength and prestige rising?	No
12515	And this question, it is simply said, is it: how can we maintain peace - to keep it without surrender?	No
11652	In the Balkans, we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to carry much of the burden.	Yes
3872	I was honored to be here.	No
29041	Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	Yes
11331	Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	No
17122	We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	Yes
621	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	No
26504	I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	No
2384	And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	No
2602	But the federal government can also play a very important role.	No
974	The best America does not abandon some of its citizens.	No
29224	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	Yes
8700	putting this tax here at home, reducing our consumption of this imported oil.	No
15333	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	No
711	We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, at sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times.	Yes
18208	We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	No
8614	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
9275	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	No
6462	The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	No
19747	We have lost credibility around the world.	No
22823	Didn't bring in enough nation.	No
9718	My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	No
23863	Personal income has decreased while people have worked harder.	Yes
1501	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	Yes
28946	We moved from the largest deficits eight years ago to the largest surpluses in today's history.	Yes
1149	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is, uh - the second time General Brown made a statement that - for which he had to apologize.	No
12752	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	Yes
20957	They oppose mine because they don't want to involve Medicare because they're afraid Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	Yes
24714	So what we have to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the number of new people added, the population, and then keep the line.	No
20496	I think the ban on partial abortions at birth would be a positive step to reduce the number of abortions in America.	No
5703	They do it all over America because they have to.	Yes
24441	I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	Yes
7101	Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.	Yes
33686	I personally believe that the measures taken by President Obama have saved the economy.	No
26712	When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.	Yes
29389	So we took the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we turned it into a fact-checker.	No
4172	Of course, it encourages and others encourage contacts, negotiations, and all other things.	No
33804	Take a look at the migration.	No
19158	I guess I rely more on the individual.	No
29751	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	No
32324	We have enough problems in this country.	No
4192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	No
12761	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	Yes
21264	There's a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	No
16854	These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	Yes
24135	With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	Yes
13511	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	No
8949	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	Yes
25508	And they set up a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	Yes
4141	He didn't say that.	No
12355	Oh, you're talking about the rules.	No
21952	Everyone cares if people don't go well.	No
28246	It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.	No
15773	And now we have the first agreement on arms control in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	Yes
15208	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	Yes
20420	I was a small tanker for a while in western Texas.	No
10158	For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	No
33783	But I think it's really an important problem.	No
11646	My wife Tipper, who is here, actually took a military plane with General Sholicatvieli on one of those flights.	No
12284	We're different about the kind of appointment we'd make.	No
15415	Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.	No
25863	May I ask you a question?	No
26918	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	No
19167	But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.	No
23306	As I have told you, we have just had a report that has said over the past 13 months, we have created 1.9 million new jobs.	Yes
22156	And it also requires that we maintain some continuity -- a bipartite commitment by the United States to certain principles.	No
25261	Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
16609	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	Yes
21020	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	No
24589	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	No
7436	And the way I see it is that there are a lot of well-established special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side or the other of the question and who spend huge sums of money and they convince different senators to stick to their own way or different Members of Parliament to talk about their question, and they are digging.	No
1041	I know I'm ready for it.	No
25892	I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defence by the year 2002 and there is less than 1% difference between my budget and the Republican defence budget.	Yes
6316	It's not going to happen on its own.	No
5495	And there are elements of my proposal that you have just described and that I will not repeat.	No
2924	He complains of secrecy and yet it is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold non-public meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume - with a view to imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	Yes
20384	It's totally wrong for him to stand up and say that.	No
1020	I have proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to one thousand dollars.	Yes
12646	The average income in some of these countries is $25 per year.	Yes
28227	We do so in my state of Texas.	No
30010	In addition, I have just been approved by ICE.	No
28781	What I cared about is could we work together.	No
20768	Let me tell you what the facts are.	No
19116	I am very proud to be the Republican candidate for Democrats and Independents.	No
21335	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	No
3238	Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	Yes
21572	I don't have CAP money in my campaign.	Yes
34398	Poor health at the most expensive price.	No
24131	I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.	No
17892	Will our children be better off?	No
6949	That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	Yes
33227	Let me tell you before we go any further.	No
27455	It is absolutely the right thing to do, to have paralysing sanctions.	No
13838	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	No
20636	Finally, whether or not there is an exit strategy.	No
26618	But we also need to look at some options, that we -- depending on the options.	No
21678	You want a job in downtown?	No
13090	I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	No
19529	They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.	Yes
7706	They set a low standard of materialism.	No
23510	Now that's not a flip-flop.	No
28298	And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	Yes
15712	We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.	Yes
27997	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	No
12346	That's an interruption, by the way.	No
24244	Their policies so far, I believe, are quite healthy.	No
30249	I agree with her on one thing.	No
2296	There were 122 communities and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	Yes
28809	So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	No
24775	But if you just want to keep the music, just stay traditional this next time, and in 4 years, you'll all have to blame everyone for a bad health care system.	No
12612	That is what we should be concerned about, not the story of ten, fifteen or twenty years ago.	No
26529	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	No
19143	I worked hard to help families pass on values to their own children.	No
15093	I was recently accused of having a secret plan for the hostages.	Yes
24957	And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?	No
10551	On the other hand, two years ago, I said we had a subprime loan crisis that needs to be addressed.	Yes
22246	Now, you're paying for that.	No
17428	But I finally did it.	No
10181	But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	No
2930	The Secretary of State appeared in the years in which he served as Secretary before eighty different hearings in the House and Senate.	Yes
12748	Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	No
11739	I certainly agree with that.	No
7768	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	Yes
17905	America is a fair society, and it is not fair for Vice President Bush to pay less taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
21549	Just no hedges, no sis, and goals and goals.	No
1601	There are no magic answers to do it.	No
27669	It is a nation, which, if it collapses, if it becomes a failing state, there are nuclear weapons there and you have -- you have terrorists there who could seize their hands -- on these nuclear weapons.	Yes
21406	But I find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight, we're in debt for $50 million more in an hour and a half.	Yes
17659	So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	Yes
12308	So long as people have input.	No
17120	But the fact is that every estimate by this administration of the size of the deficit has been reduced by billions and billions of dollars.	Yes
28308	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan does not do.	No
25399	And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.	No
22584	Charlie, thank you, and thank you to our panelists.	No
32046	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	No
18077	I decided to go myself.	No
28802	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	Yes
18560	I didn't say I'd get the troops out in six months.	Yes
22157	And I would just say that there are three things I would like to say -- number one -- we have to maintain the strongest defence in the world.	No
18237	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend itself against these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they are on the way, you know, to a nation that is free; that is then.	No
15533	And he could do the job.	No
16784	And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	Yes
13364	I hope, in the context of a different monetary policy, that it will be possible to reduce this burden of interest rates, at least $1 billion.	No
25967	Now they have to try harder if they want to continue to get federal funding.	No
1460	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	No
26806	Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	No
28583	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	Yes
3115	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	No
27915	What we cannot do is go back to the same policies that have led us to such difficulties.	No
28179	I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	No
1585	We've become almost a welfare state.	No
4211	"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	No
15404	Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	No
32589	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	No
12098	Well, I have a plan to do something about it.	No
24988	I think that dealing with the Soviet Union must be realistic.	No
26160	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	No
2528	That's one way one could do it.	No
9963	Mr. President, did you look at your pension?	No
15893	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	No
2388	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	Yes
19099	Let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	No
27373	If you haven't balanced your budget, you've lost your business.	No
21619	That's the problem with our system.	No
28698	But I think we should talk clearly to the moguls in Hollywood and the people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	No
28226	I think we should measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth year.	No
18991	You know my opinion of North Korea.	No
33280	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	No
16642	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	No
10852	And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.	No
32188	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	No
14067	But that's happening as we sit here today.	No
18128	Iraq was not even close to the centre of the war on terror until the president invaded it.	Yes
30294	No one's ever seen that.	No
27741	It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	Yes
20473	And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	No
23771	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	No
28304	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	No
32460	One of the best provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I cancel the tax code.	No
28738	But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.	No
28452	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	No
17759	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	Yes
17606	I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	Yes
604	I don't think it's about eliminating.	No
17521	I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	No
8167	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	No
24331	We are the envy of the world in terms of economy, despite the difficulties we have.	No
30442	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	No
9713	I want regulators to see their work as encouraging small businesses, not crushing them.	No
6803	Consider, for example, the prohibition of partial abortion at birth.	No
19482	Brady Bill has prevented at least 60,000 criminals, fugitives and stalkers from obtaining weapons by hand.	Yes
17426	I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	No
16761	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	Yes
22259	Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	No
5795	And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	No
14986	You have to see it to believe it.	No
11428	We have the strongest army, and I will do whatever is necessary, if I am president, to make sure it stays that way.	Yes
1130	And so, that was why I didn't identify any particular action lines when I answered a question a week ago.	No
12075	But I feel very strongly about that.	No
10543	If they can't get a loan, that means they can't pay.	No
19276	He twisted his arms and got six democrats to vote on the other side, but we lost by a vote.	Yes
21341	So what's the answer?	No
19447	We need to do this together and we can.	No
20245	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	Yes
11398	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	No
8507	The fact is that this was a less important bill than you recommended, Mr.Nixon, this morning, in your proposal.	Yes
10554	And Senator McCain said during that time that we should continue to deregulate because that's how the free enterprise system works.	Yes
33909	I think that's been proven.	No
34232	Take a look at it.	No
2227	That's the plan I proposed.	No
5628	If we now invest in our young people and their ability to go to university, it will enable them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	No
1684	This is obviously a very delicate subject.	No
33427	...to sign the immigration reform, and George W. Bush also supported it.	Yes
16665	At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	Yes
32344	How can we implement them?	No
7947	And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	No
11828	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	No
1714	And I want to make sure we keep the classes low for our young people.	No
8530	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	No
19469	This keeps up with technology.	No
1399	And then I would like to name people who would be interested in helping with that.	No
3052	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military equipment to the People's Republic of China, or to any other communist nation, such as the Soviet Union, etc.	No
21308	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	No
13766	I don't think in racial harmony I'm a vegetable on that.	No
16059	And I'm very proud of it.	No
16591	We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	No
2826	We should expand our aircraft purchases, we should reduce our shipbuilding program, we should reduce research and development by 8 percent for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Navy.	No
25298	We cannot solve this problem on our own.	No
8663	But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.	No
91	And what I'm about to say is unclassified.	No
20415	I think that's the wrong choice.	No
27772	We want a stable world.	No
23090	He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.	Yes
23311	First of all, the president's $2.2 trillion figures are not accurate.	Yes
15846	It got a little mean.	No
8020	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	No
24695	The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	Yes
22839	Meanwhile, as Iran moves towards nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they call yellow cake, what they use to make enriched uranium, while they do, North Korea has gone from a bomb to perhaps four to seven bombs.	Yes
10620	The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	Yes
18973	It somehow brought back the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	No
6831	It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	No
8259	Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.	No
16016	And I'm going to keep this Trust Fund of Social Security healthy and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe lagging behind, maybe when you get two decades or one in the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	No
8936	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	No
32549	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	Yes
9810	In fact, he doubled it.	Yes
24329	Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.	No
29772	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	No
3171	And with our economy in such a terrible and worsening disarray within the month.	No
2341	You're saying we gave mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	No
6732	It's important that we do this.	No
195	I think we should do it by everyone doing what he can out of conscience.	No
3227	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	No
7654	That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	Yes
7918	If we negotiate from a position where the balance or wave is moving away from us, it is extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as on other issues.	No
20300	There are many young workers at our gatherings that we go to that when they hear that I will trust them in their choice to be able to manage, according to some guidelines, part of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	No
33143	Thank you very much, Chris.	No
32183	Their method of fixing is to return to the Congress for more and more money, more and more money.	No
3243	He put pressure on Congress — and I do not think Mr Ford would deny that — to hold on to non-proliferation legislation until Congress had agreed on an $8 billion programme for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	Yes
27652	You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	No
24243	I don't have to worry about the Federal Reserve in the short term.	No
20144	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	No
13640	This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.	No
13386	Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.	No
3082	Another thing we need to do is to restore the good relations we should have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	No
14713	And it's not tax and spend economics.	No
21427	We will deal with our problems, we will solve our problems.	No
17272	First of all, I accept President Reagan's assertion of faith.	No
165	Capital gains, one more point, please, let's learn from history.	No
32276	But the name is there.	No
24777	Let's go.	No
4247	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	No
18132	You're not taking America to war unless you have the plan to win peace.	No
23456	Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	Yes
2224	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	No
1959	Number two, I'm going to take programs that are currently good programs, but I think could be run more effectively at the state level and send them to the state.	No
15294	Today, there are billions of dollars in balance, and the only answer that has come so far is our country's biggest tax increase - the increase in wages taxes for social security - that will only put band assistance on this point and delay the day of taking into account a few years at the most.	Yes
34321	And if we do, you don't have to ask your question, because we have a huge machine.	No
5660	I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.	Yes
20392	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	Yes
25244	I read his statement the other day.	No
8438	My objection here is the potential cost of controls and possible freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	No
8587	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	Yes
3828	But we must use our army wisely.	No
8450	That is not my point of view, and I think it must be said very clearly.	No
8878	This money, I think, should be used to rebuild the base of our cities.	No
32818	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	Yes
26758	You see him in the church burns.	No
1376	While I was governor of Georgia, although I am not a lawyer, we have had a comprehensive reform of the Georgian judicial system.	Yes
1497	So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	No
21842	People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.	No
19926	Each of them is entitled to a tax reduction.	Yes
26708	And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	No
1593	The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	Yes
17398	So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	No
441	And I prefer the death penalty.	No
20720	We must find ways to restore it within the framework of foreign policy and national security policy.	No
20146	And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	No
11582	I had the impression that Milosevic, who was uncontrolled, would harm NATO, and that would depend on the situation, Mr Vice-President.	No
29326	You were totally in favor of it.	Yes
24591	I looked at these people -- the same for our local law enforcement.	No
3922	He didn't say that.	No
3302	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	Yes
26286	If you take care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	Yes
27926	I've met some of these people.	No
28646	I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.	No
13308	Must be a man's test.	No
12252	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	Yes
3587	I fought my career against her.	No
17366	I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	No
33229	So, we have the toughest laws, and you have huge gun violence.	Yes
27252	Trade is increasing by about 12 percent per year.	Yes
24910	And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	Yes
14956	And inflation fell below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and cut government spending.	Yes
7862	Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	No
8968	And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	No
29703	We have to work with the police.	No
16901	Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	No
8558	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	No
512	That's how you help people.	No
3976	And the Pakistanis will have to understand that this attack at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was the signal of the terrorists that they do not want this government to cooperate with us in the fight against the Taliban and jihadist elements.	Yes
34427	Well, I'd like to tell everyone watching tonight that I'm in contact with all the Americans -- Democrats, Republicans and Independents -- because we need everyone to help make our country what it should be, to develop the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	No
15867	They cannot live in the community in which they grew up.	No
7943	So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	No
21855	If you're leaving a company, I think your insurance should go with you to other business.	No
1169	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - hair salons, beauty salons, restaurants, shops, factory change lines also in the agricultural markets and cattle sales barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	No
11300	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	No
20730	The key question to be answered in this election is whether we will use this prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and not just a few.	No
11077	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	No
19492	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	No
2276	You can't have free market work if you don't have regulation.	No
21804	I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.	Yes
1050	When you have seven and a half million unemployed people, and you have three times as much inflation as in the last eight years of the democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you, uh - become increasingly difficult a family to put a child in college or own a house, there is a natural tendency to be turned off.	Yes
12531	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	No
20118	He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	No
32398	It was principled, and it was strategic.	No
4230	So, this is a very difficult situation.	No
20060	It is a question of trust and fear, and I would say, Mr President, that all you have in this campaign is fear.	No
25986	I disappeared for 44 months, so let's go smoke, let's see they didn't even do it.	No
21608	I went to a boys' club.	No
16602	For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	Yes
10234	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially to retain the value of their currency.	Yes
32681	Iran and Russia are now against us.	Yes
32764	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	Yes
30301	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	No
22164	We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.	No
7101	Here's what I'm going to do: Number one, borders are running more today than before September 11.	Yes
24180	And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	No
13023	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	No
16016	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	No
13465	He also said a while ago that we would get more money to fund his programs by revising tax laws, including exhaustion.	No
716	Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	No
25487	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	No
26244	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	No
27269	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	No
19187	Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
3846	He raised a whole bunch of them.	No
12598	It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	No
549	But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	No
23911	Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	No
79	You know, we have 5% of the world's population in this country.	Yes
15634	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	No
24702	Across the country, they can't even buy drugs.	No
3497	Many of us have seen this train wreck coming.	No
17813	This administration seems to be handling this every morning.	No
2425	We haven't put in place any advice that can tell people what treatment they're going to receive.	Yes
7826	If we want to fight unemployment, we need to do better work in these areas.	No
17551	Under the 1981 tax bill, individuals earning $200,000 per year received $60,000 in tax relief over three years, while individuals earning $30,000 per year, all taxes considered, received no relief at all or their taxes actually increased.	Yes
28497	I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	No
4213	I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	No
17787	I told you never would I do such a thing.	No
21717	I am not for national registration of firearms.	Yes
18843	But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	No
26733	It seems to me that the President, whatever the President, is one of his highest responsibilities.	No
19349	That is why we need a reform of campaign funding.	No
22305	Not in schools, but in -- you know, 46% of Chicago teachers, public school teachers, send their children to private school.	Yes
21901	If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	No
6809	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	No
31847	Of course, I hope to win your vote, I hope to be elected in November, and I can promise you that I will work with all the Americans.	No
19156	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	Yes
22584	Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	No
12712	Its influence is growing - mainly because this administration has ignored Latin America.	Yes
12460	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	No
1667	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	No
14332	That gets to the national honor.	No
22019	I agree with the governor.	No
6659	"""And I looked them in the eye and I said, ""No, I can't do that."""	No
21462	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	No
13909	Let's go to the center of the bull's eye, the main problem.	No
14368	So that's what I'll do as president.	No
15378	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	No
17030	In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	No
27786	But this can't keep on going.	No
27741	It is not government investment that increases businesses and hires people.	Yes
6280	There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	No
12616	Will there be others in Guinea and Ghana, who have now voted with the communists frequently as new independent African countries?	Yes
6200	I'm going to look for judges who have an exceptional legal record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have an idea of what people in the real world are going through.	No
20225	We know how to set agendas.	No
15799	I think of the people in the law enforcement community who take their lives in their hands every day, when they go up to one of these doors and push them down and try to stop this flow of drugs in our communities and children.	No
17010	We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	No
967	With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.	No
133	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	No
7339	This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	Yes
16291	These Sandinists entered and betrayed the confidence of the revolution; they said it was democracy, and they did nothing but consolidate their Marxist domination over this country.	No
5530	We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	No
19597	They lost about a million people during the war, the Korean war, the forgotten war.	Yes
34059	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	Yes
15363	Well, Barbara, I think there is a fundamental difference - and I think it was obvious in most of the answers that Mr. Carter gave tonight - that he is looking for a solution to something else for a federal government program.	No
29164	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	No
24150	And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	No
8002	Unless there was a serious recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, $12 billion - greater than any administration in the history of the United States.	Yes
1510	I think the increase and the outlook for me and for me - less favourable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter, uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions he takes.	No
25647	I was just going to -- --	No
26347	We had a better idea.	No
25772	I also did everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to gather people and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	No
34018	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	No
9887	Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	No
13109	It's the story of dictators.	No
33528	The Russians said, according to many, a lot of reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do it.	Yes
17532	Net farm income has declined by 50% over the past three years, and every farmer knows that.	Yes
8117	If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	No
10878	But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the file.	No
1962	That is the approach we must take to bring America to a balanced budget.	No
3286	This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	No
10916	Senator Obama has approved the storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
26016	But now we can, we should spend this budget now and put ten years on it right away, so no one has to worry about it.	No
28260	First of all, vouchers are up to states.	No
557	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	No
1082	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	No
28045	Doctors give prescriptions, recommend treatments, and then their recommendations are rejected by HMOs and insurance companies.	Yes
24369	It was we who lowered the barrier to products with the Carla Hill negotiations.	Yes
622	But now we have a very good concept called competitive strategies.	No
25180	I will not exploit, for political purposes, the youth and inexperience of my opponent.	No
19930	I think it's pretty liberal, I'm gonna put that label on it.	No
4020	"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	No
26016	But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	No
29715	You walk down the street, you get shot.	No
28698	But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	No
24814	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	No
33030	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	Yes
8021	Secondly, I do not suggest withdrawal to the point of the communist weapon.	No
19810	Personally, I don't think this is the good future for America, and I think we should take another tack.	No
389	But the governors are ready, the mayors are ready.	No
27269	Let's talk about what we need to compete.	No
12741	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	Yes
27090	And what I'm afraid of is that we've been watching over the past year, first of all the President saying, and then we'll let the UN deal with it.	No
6977	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: the cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying that the current system is correct, far exceeds the cost of trying to save the system for our children.	Yes
7078	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	No
19618	Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	No
18128	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.	Yes
7348	We have expanded the Pell grants by a million students.	Yes
8012	But it is extremely difficult to make that judgment.	No
6734	And it's to be honored.	No
19611	In 1992, before I became President, Congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act and I vigorously implemented it.	Yes
6614	Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	No
21214	I want you to know that I care passionately and that I will fight until it becomes the law.	No
23282	And looking around here, in this group here, I think there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	No
13428	This administration and this country experienced last year the lowest rate of economic growth - meaning jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	Yes
342	There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.	Yes
841	And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	No
4061	Let's just make that very clear.	No
18927	We convinced Libya to disarm.	Yes
20424	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	No
2892	I talked to them and I listened.	No
18101	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	No
34359	I want to invest in your family.	No
25094	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	No
1266	In addition, within the federal government, we provide cities with approximately $3,300 million in what we call community development.	Yes
32566	And, once again, Bernie Sanders, it's really a bad judgment.	No
26421	In California, we earned $37 billion in eligible telecommunications equipment for export for the first time.	Yes
26266	You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	No
11989	So I favor closing the gun show loophole.	No
13605	Most people work harder for less money than they did 10 years ago.	No
18884	He needed to be disarmed.	No
3373	We can be one more time.	No
3300	I think the American people have only one requirement - uh - that the facts concerning Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	No
6906	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	Yes
2478	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	No
28557	There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.	Yes
12748	In this regard, I would like to point out that the facts are simply not as stated.	No
6972	And the combined interest rate will make it more likely that the social security system will be solvent for our children and grandchildren.	No
724	And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	Yes
6863	That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.	Yes
28791	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	No
13921	Yeah, it'll create bubble jobs.	Yes
18187	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	No
17349	The American people want arms control.	No
21816	I think you need to tackle medical fraud.	No
15687	We have always been an ambitious nation for America and we are moving forward.	No
32084	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she says there's nothing wrong.	Yes
15446	Next Tuesday, you will all go to the polls, you will be there in the polling station and you will make a decision.	No
415	I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.	No
2810	Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.	Yes
13196	The road to war is always paved with good intentions.	No
25947	Not until 1996 -- I don't want anyone to smoke.	No
13974	Anyone else can direct the middle class down and direct the economy into a ditch.	No
14662	And we are going to pave the way for the exit of this economic recession around the world and the economic slowdown here at home.	No
22490	You have to decide whether or not you want to change.	No
34182	That's what we have to do.	No
33749	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	Yes
28000	I would like to be the next President of the United States to support and assist this great nation and to ensure that we all remain America as the hope of the earth.	No
5617	And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	Yes
1535	We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	Yes
13335	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	No
6758	I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
3168	I think we need to stay that way and continue to build our capacity to deal with any potential threat.	No
32968	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	No
25573	I accept his goal and his dream; we all do.	No
514	I know what strong political leadership is.	No
16825	A few things that can be done: we now have a deferral system so that multinationals investing abroad - if they earn $1 million in profits abroad - don't have to pay their taxes unless they bring their money back to that country.	Yes
12775	I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	No
34277	This would not be done just on the first day.	No
3268	The United States must maintain a defence capability on the Panama Canal.	No
25054	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	No
6270	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	No
13520	Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	Yes
14846	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	No
8135	These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	No
14747	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	No
13358	Yes, I said in both debates and I repeat that I believe in a balanced budget and that I have supported this concept during my fourteen years in Congress.	Yes
28298	And it's the largest number ever recorded this year and they're going to beat the record next year and every year for ten years.	Yes
19195	This is not true in Connecticut, family income is declining.	Yes
12668	We want the freedom to win.	No
30163	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	No
1303	But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.	No
26353	And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	Yes
1586	We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	Yes
27060	We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	Yes
13273	It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	No
7873	If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	Yes
598	And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	No
7218	89 billion dollars last year to the first percent of Americans, but children lost their programs after school.	Yes
13017	Does this show that communism has the greatest traction, or that freedom has the greatest traction?	No
8937	And we used - yes, we used - the five-year projections of the Senate Budget Committee, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which I believe can be eliminated under our plan.	Yes
3680	There are a series of things that will probably have to be delayed.	No
18819	I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	No
8352	As for what counts and if it's experience that counts, it's not for me to say.	No
23709	We didn't keep 850,000 tons of ammunition.	Yes
21252	We're at a fork in the road.	No
4158	When we talk about preconditions - and Henry Kissinger said we should have contacts without preconditions - the idea is that we do not expect to solve all the problems before starting talks.	No
27196	And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	Yes
19338	Let me say, first of all, that I signed a bill on criminal reform that dealt with civil aviation two years ago.	Yes
32350	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	Yes
28407	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	No
26348	Now we have a majority and we get a president.	No
18894	I've done a lot of work on this.	No
17762	It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.	No
6631	I want you to notice how the president turned away from jobs and started talking mainly about education.	No
23875	Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	No
17408	We've added millions of acres to wild land, to game shelters.	Yes
22859	Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	No
9904	And we must make sure that we give them a way to citizenship.	No
25480	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	No
25862	America owes you a debt of gratitude.	No
17524	There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	Yes
20539	I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	No
28037	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you want to forgive me, I would like to say something from the beginning of this debate following the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	No
10497	I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	No
22969	And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	No
29941	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	Yes
24368	We're the ones who settled the prison's employment contract.	Yes
6921	With all due respect, I'm not sure it's credible to quote the main news agencies on -- oh, whatever.	No
13018	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	No
6540	We are the richest country on the planet, the only industrialized country in the world not to do so.	Yes
20907	All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.	No
19089	And thank you to the people of Hartford, our guests.	No
21367	But I can't predict all the things that are going to happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	No
1419	And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	No
17813	This administration seems to run that every morning.	No
26456	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	No
12154	He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	Yes
17276	And I don't know if I was born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	No
3359	Will we have a secret government that excludes the American people from participation in fundamental decision-making and thus covers mistakes and allows our government - our government - to deviate from the principles of our Constitution and our Bill of Rights?	No
13696	I'll give you an example.	No
32566	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	No
7998	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	No
1387	I think the Burger Court has upheld this fundamental and highly controversial decision of the Warren Court.	Yes
15517	He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	Yes
33787	He was prosecuted by the Department of Justice for racial discrimination in his buildings.	Yes
29715	You walk down the street, you get shot.	No
3062	But I would never let this friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of preserving the independence and freedom of the Taiwanese people.	No
13156	It may be necessary for us to start testing again.	No
30	Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	No
4357	All of this would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of the conditions on the ground.	No
23527	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	No
29724	We have to bring back law and order.	No
20896	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	No
29868	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	No
3643	It is not a good deal for the American people.	No
3751	It seems to me that if we want to be strong both at home and abroad, we must consider putting an end to this war.	No
13406	And in addition to that, we need programmes, especially in higher education, that will stimulate scientific breakthroughs that will bring more growth.	No
29034	I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	No
20405	And here is the simple difference.	No
22177	I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.	No
13005	It means seeing that our economy is moving even faster than it has.	No
6021	Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	Yes
32017	It was long before I got involved, so you really need an apology.	No
1881	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
7773	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	Yes
16902	We will make some gains in the United States Senate.	No
18880	I have no intention of wilting.	No
7329	If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	No
1973	That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	Yes
25746	There is no doubt that many Americans have lost their faith in the government.	No
24492	I do not believe that the legalization of narcotics is the answer.	No
22582	It's not a washy, and that's why I'm fighting, you.	No
3059	There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.	No
27488	And the reason is so important - and this is a testimony to how we have restored American credibility and strength throughout the world - is that we have to make sure that all countries have participated, even countries like Russia and China.	No
32752	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	No
17374	As the issue evolves, I think it will become more and more clear that what I say and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think it will lead to greater strength.	No
11939	And I enjoyed the way the administration signed the law on the defense of marriage.	No
33178	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	No
26201	As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	No
409	We are serving a million more families now.	Yes
28050	I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	No
22281	We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	No
2318	You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	Yes
3457	But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	Yes
16639	And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	Yes
13312	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	No
14494	It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.	No
2651	The right answer for the government is: How can we make the private sector more efficient and effective?	No
29792	In many places, our police are more armed.	Yes
2509	The reason is that when we reform Wall Street, when we address the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are difficult problems and we have to make choices.	No
34288	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	No
15692	But let us stop labeling each other and let us go to the heart of the question that is the future of this country.	No
20120	And he cut the defense another $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	Yes
27031	...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	No
24775	But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	No
16461	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	Yes
6754	And I met wives who supported their husbands or vice versa when they eventually escaped and allowed themselves to live who they were, that they thought God had made them.	No
4033	And we honor all the services they have rendered.	No
491	I think it's okay.	No
23332	They do not name him the most liberal of the United States Senate because he has not come to many meetings.	Yes
23542	I am the first President to authorize federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.	Yes
13432	Many say four and a half percent.	No
17432	Farmers have suffered double-digit inflation and 211/2 per cent interest rates from the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which have destroyed our national reliability as a supplier.	Yes
1452	We will see unemployment decline, more jobs available, and the inflation rate decrease.	No
27276	We were not very lucky to talk about it in the last debate.	No
28111	So, I think step one to make sure that prescription drugs are more affordable for seniors, and it's people who really rely on prescription drugs these days, is to reform the health insurance system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of health insurance once and for all.	No
7427	And if the Americans trust me with the presidency, I can promise you, we will have the most important effort, openly - not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideological efforts to push people back - but a real effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	No
5576	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95% of Americans.	Yes
15797	Members of the clergy who did the same.	No
8665	I simply think that when we are facing a budget deficit this year - and this exercise will end in about ten days, and we are facing the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps up to $63 billion - that would simply be irresponsible.	Yes
28713	And I'm so proud of what she did by getting them up there.	No
19439	Let me repeat that we had a tsar of drugs in Arkansas, but he replied to the governor, as he replied to the president.	Yes
19253	Stop scaring the elders, Mr. President.	No
33424	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	No
33911	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have time to do it.	No
23231	One per cent of America, the highest per cent of income earned in America, received $89 billion in tax reductions last year.	Yes
27105	But when it was time to make sure that Gaddafi had not remained in power, that he had been captured, Governor, your suggestion was that it was not a mission, that it was a sloppy mission.	Yes
18040	And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	No
29409	Go to his website.	No
27258	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us - time zone, language possibilities.	No
23859	I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.	No
13130	Mr. Nixon suggested that the United States should go to war if both islands were attacked.	Yes
16234	But take a look at the democratic convention.	No
27995	I'm convinced we'll do it.	No
923	As far as the Third World is concerned, I support the Baker Plan.	No
22194	But she is absolutely right.	No
24774	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	No
27274	This is not the kind of small business promotion we need.	No
16685	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	No
11995	Some of the restrictions that have been imposed by Congress over the past two years.	Yes
3800	I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	No
3569	So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	No
17755	And I did what no presidential candidate ever did, I told you before the election what I would do.	No
10377	There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	No
24810	And then I think of the older people who are retired.	No
21661	These people are hurting in the inner cities.	No
16506	As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	Yes
10708	I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	Yes
23272	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the '90s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	No
12879	This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	No
18672	And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	No
4203	You deal with Russia on the basis, what are you on -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	No
26174	Of course, the president will take the credit.	No
27665	No, it is not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is about to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I mentioned earlier, the Taliban, the Haqqani network.	Yes
25715	What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	No
23069	You know what he did?	No
13770	And I beat Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that provides guarantees against discrimination in employment.	Yes
28660	I don't think that's the role of the president.	No
12622	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	No
3897	I objected to the funding of a mission that had no calendar, and was open, giving George Bush a blank cheque.	Yes
889	Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	No
32191	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	Yes
25706	And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	No
21660	But the facts are -- the facts are -- the American people are hurt.	No
17377	Well, again, I'm running on the record.	No
34042	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	Yes
21812	So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	No
32736	And I'm pretty good at it.	No
2853	We wanted to put an end to bloodshed in southern Africa.	No
20334	If I could respond to that.	No
19861	And, senator, I remind you that a few years ago, when I supported the teacher tests while I was in my original state, I was pretty well hit by the teachers' association.	Yes
17897	Are we better off when we think our human rights values are greater?	No
17708	There is a link between interest rates and inflation, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in 1981, as we were still operating on the Carter-Mondale budget we inherited, interest rates fell from 211/2 to 12 or 13.	Yes
9026	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	No
18929	I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.	No
1999	But in my opinion, the president should have caught him.	No
27155	But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	No
26687	By far, the greatest number in American history -- not just the great ones you've talked about, but many smaller ones.	Yes
25142	I could have gone on forever.	No
4027	And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.	No
26689	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they copy our CDs, and cost thousands of jobs in places like California.	Yes
21925	Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	No
23609	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	No
2111	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	No
2321	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	Yes
2349	It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	Yes
2628	So there was no risk to banks or lenders, but they took billions out of the system.	Yes
19356	He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.	Yes
14619	You stay long enough, you think -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	No
8490	I would say that, of course, we expect to take some seats in the House and in the Senate.	No
7896	I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	No
17403	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	No
24777	Let's get on with it.	No
14992	"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	No
21014	We have moved from the largest deficits to the largest surpluses.	Yes
12873	Thirdly, I believe that India is a major area of positive action on the part of the free world.	No
26431	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	Yes
14448	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	Yes
5978	So, I think we can easily, in seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds into it, we can eliminate our dependence on places in the world that harm our national security if we do not achieve our independence.	No
13421	But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	No
711	We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.	Yes
33663	Nor will I add a penny to the debt.	No
23117	Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.	Yes
28242	I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	No
9014	I believe in freedom of choice.	No
12167	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we are reducing the number of uninsured percentages of our population.	Yes
855	No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	No
18190	I'll do it in four years.	No
2232	And private insurers must make a profit.	No
761	And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	Yes
28424	I have to take this, Jim.	No
16228	The American people are up to here with debates.	No
21832	I don't want to stampede.	No
32991	Hillary talked about contributions so you could understand.	No
883	Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything, then only one person thinks.	No
11429	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	No
16090	And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.	No
16992	It is time for government, industry, labour, manufacturing, agriculture, education, and other entities of our society to cooperate.	No
10751	It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	No
2416	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	Yes
34409	I want to improve benefits for low-income workers and women who have been disadvantaged by the current social security system.	No
5517	But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.	No
19162	We will have specific differences later.	No
13228	I'm gonna have to tell Mr. Morton.	No
29055	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	No
21319	And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	No
22611	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	No
18196	My administration has tripled the amount we spend on internal security to $30 billion a year.	Yes
17700	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	No
26990	I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.	No
12642	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	Yes
6832	These are accounts that allow someone to buy a low-interest, high-deductible disaster plan and pair it with tax-exempt savings.	No
2046	I don't want to go down on the way to Spain.	No
24040	At the moment, we are spending about $300 billion a year on defence, the Japanese are spending about $30 billion in Asia, the Germans are spending about $30 billion in Europe.	Yes
26409	Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.	No
29439	And instead of bringing him back and putting the money to work, because they can't work an agreement to -- and everyone agrees that he should be brought back.	No
32379	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	Yes
6250	"This is the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health""."	No
13128	This is the current American position.	No
22489	That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	Yes
20460	My answer to you is in the short term that we have to get after it here in America.	No
7641	We lost three thousand American lives.	Yes
11131	We must help the Pakistani government to enter Waziristan, where I visited a very hard country, and - and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	No
19606	We have here Cuba 90 miles from our coasts, and what we have done, we have passed the law that gave people the right to prosecute and the President has postponed it for six months.	Yes
33858	I think it is up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of argument between people, where instead of celebrating our diversity, we raise people, and we make our country even bigger.	No
19852	Let's not go, let's help, let's go back to the schools to the teachers and get back to the parents and take them away from the National Education Association.	No
27390	I want to make sure we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	No
12688	It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.	No
16558	There was hatred, there were divisions - people had lost confidence in their government in many respects.	No
8503	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	Yes
6755	I think we have to respect that.	No
15182	And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	No
28735	I spend a lot of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech on the strain, I usually finish my speech by saying, I want to ask you something and I want to direct it mainly to young people in the audience.	No
9038	And there might be a feeling of injustice about it because he wasn't there to answer.	No
12139	Fortunately, he was arrested in his footsteps.	No
5549	I think that fiscal policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	No
5588	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	Yes
10669	My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
22990	That's why the Patriot Act was important.	No
17594	But if you take it as a percentage, then you find that it's fair and fair overall.	No
8031	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	No
16152	And we should expand our markets abroad.	No
17023	Governor Carter adopted the record of this Congress, dominated by his political party.	Yes
17240	And so, we made a proposal.	No
9773	"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""	No
15305	Although Governor Reagan has recently changed his position, on four occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system that, in fact, would go bankrupt very quickly.	Yes
34041	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	No
3457	But the fact is -- the fact is that we finally saw Republicans and Democrats sitting and negotiating together and finding a package.	Yes
21082	Revenues exceed social security spending until 2015, which means that all retirees will get the promises made.	Yes
11970	I have no idea.	No
2759	The president has been re-elected, you will see dramatic cuts in our army.	No
15329	These are the types of elements of a national health insurance, important for the American people.	No
1511	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	No
17406	When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.	Yes
13890	Let's just talk about CAFE standards -- these are energy efficiency standards.	No
23641	My opponent was against that.	Yes
24904	This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	No
26503	And I think right now we got to go back.	No
16892	They spend too much money on themselves.	No
10500	Maybe someone here did a little business with them.	No
33307	Drugs flow across the border.	Yes
24710	I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	No
2115	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.	No
13328	I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.	No
9342	And so what we did was take away those leases.	No
3879	And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	No
18986	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	Yes
18594	The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	No
2555	And so what I tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	No
2569	Well, first, I love great schools.	No
16581	And - and the whole subject of crime is a subject that very much concerns our people, and I think that the fairness of this one is - is one - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and that is something that has not been adequately dealt with by - this administration.	No
7152	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	No
8903	And why have they lost their industry?	No
28317	The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.	Yes
27592	In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	Yes
25704	I was going to applaud, too.	No
25286	I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.	No
16629	There's no way to get the answer to a question.	No
28139	And they are trying to artificially extend monopolistic patent protection so that they can continue to charge these very high prices.	Yes
18015	And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.	No
16662	We believe you can do something more effective with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	No
14673	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	Yes
22361	I don't know -- starting after 4 years.	No
8464	It did not reach the House of Representatives.	Yes
1748	And so the question is how to get them going again.	No
22994	No, but he's for weakening it.	No
14591	We are a rising nation.	Yes
23385	And I just told you the facts, sir.	No
18709	And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	No
13093	There were three democratic presidents who led us to war.	Yes
9912	If my daughter or yours is looking at someone like he's not a citizen, I don't want to -- I don't want to give someone power like that.	No
19993	It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	No
19689	We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	Yes
5930	And, by the way, it also includes families with special needs.	No
31921	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	No
1368	And, uh - the only goal I'd see in the record of handguns and not long weapons of any kind would be to ban ownership of these weapons by those who used them in the commission of a crime, or who have been proven to be mentally incompetent to possess a weapon.	Yes
32779	And I know there's a lot of concern about this in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that the Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the main way we take Raqqa after driving ISIS out of Iraq.	No
16926	And there has been a constant quarrel between the president and Congress, and that's not how this country should be run.	No
22567	I've argued that we should fully funded it.	No
34409	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	No
28317	The federal government is increasing about 6% of the money.	Yes
13362	We have spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the previous hundred years of the Department of Agriculture.	Yes
18233	We will never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take control to protect themselves.	No
391	We'll need some money, John.	No
561	It's not the length of your resume.	No
6148	You all just heard my plan.	No
21999	Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	No
15554	And the main thing is that taxes have been reduced, and yet the federal government's income is 25% in the last three years.	Yes
29287	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	No
18100	But to say that there is only one focus on the war on terrorism does not really understand the nature of the war on terrorism.	No
24327	National security, economic strength, democracy.	No
382	The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	No
13890	Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.	No
27920	When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.	Yes
22733	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.	No
2489	Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.	Yes
18256	When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.	No
26231	To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	No
14312	-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	No
19696	We had to do something, and even if all our allies didn't support it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	No
22631	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	No
29056	I don't think the surplus is government money.	No
29616	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	Yes
15890	Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	No
34096	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also through the help and advice of the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	Yes
6097	And I'm glad to talk to you, too, Joe, if you're outside.	No
10234	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	Yes
27579	I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	Yes
24083	These young people, when they leave this wonderful university, will find it difficult to find a job.	No
8389	The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	Yes
25352	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration has done.	No
25054	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	No
2977	He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.	No
8082	The democratic party of this century has defended something.	No
24801	Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	No
26728	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	No
19416	I think we all do.	No
13950	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that once he decides, he sees merit, but he sees a lot of things that are wrong.	No
19906	We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	No
19848	I've supported all the education programs.	Yes
12260	And now that energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating these big energy taxes right now.	No
21674	That's something I know how to do.	No
31963	She campaigned where the first part of her campaign...	No
29599	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	No
27758	The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
20973	They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.	No
11652	In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	Yes
23951	I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	No
32964	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	No
19638	There were several out-of-topic quaffers in this litany.	No
4048	So the point is that we will win in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	No
650	What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.	No
13866	They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	No
15346	So it is good for the American people to remember that there is a clear fundamental historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also between the two parties we represent.	No
27801	And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	Yes
19304	The senator mentioned the lawyers at the trial.	No
25442	And to give them such technology, I disagree.	No
28085	And I would particularly like to know if Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main outstanding bill.	No
6785	I know that throughout my life it has made a difference to me.	No
3696	And I also think we will have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is lagging behind, our roads, our bridges, but also the broadband lines that reach rural communities.	No
447	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	No
32685	You don't even know who the rebels are.	No
14653	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	No
9690	Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	No
1457	Since he was at the office, two and a half million Americans have lost their jobs.	Yes
13369	But I think the next administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	No
24059	I don't think we need 150,000 soldiers.	No
11245	We haven't been doing enough of that.	No
4113	"Now understand what it means ""without preconditions""."	No
3977	So we have a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	No
15419	And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	No
21647	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get this bill signed because I'm talking to the democratic leaders and they want it.	No
30364	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	No
10057	Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	No
27975	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	No
16208	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	Yes
29658	I built an unbelievable company.	No
13623	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	No
27228	Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	Yes
19550	And the institutions are starting to work.	No
3687	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	Yes
27440	The work we have done on sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	Yes
21850	That means keep government out of it.	No
11966	I wonder if the governor would support this law.	No
2067	And so if we take a balanced approach, what we can do is also help young people, as we have already done during my administration, to make sure they can afford to go to university.	No
1662	And because of the resilience and determination of the American people, we began to fight back.	No
7520	And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	No
28119	I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	No
18031	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	No
27118	But I don't want to see military involvement from our troops.	No
14255	Of the three of us, I balanced a government budget 12 times, I offered and passed campaign funding reform, offered, pushed and adopted into the restrictions of public referendum lobbyists, does the kind of things you need to do to bring legislators together not only to build consensus, but to challenge them to change.	Yes
23612	Religion has been a huge part of my life.	No
16651	We were faced with high inflation, more than 12 per cent; we were faced with high unemployment.	Yes
3270	The negotiations conducted so far through the Panama Canal have begun under the Johnson presidency and have continued so far.	Yes
20999	We need to do more and better.	No
24351	I think our relations with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it's a mistake for us to do what this administration did when all these kids went there wearing the Statue of Liberty on Tiananmen Square.	No
1365	"Earlier, Mr Levi, his attorney general, presented a proposal for arms control, which Mr Ford later, I believe, agreed, calling for a ban on the sale of the so-called ""Saturday Night Specials""."	Yes
8757	Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	Yes
28116	That's part of an overall overhaul.	No
7193	But let me go a step further.	No
16718	We cannot afford to give up this opportunity until later.	No
18680	I'd have made a better choice.	No
2221	I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	No
6964	And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	No
24776	Speech is cheap; words are abundant, deeds are precious.	No
17009	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have in us the strength, character, intelligence, experience, patriotism, idealism, compassion, the feeling of fraternity on which we can count in the future to restore the greatness of our country.	No
34435	I hope you give me a chance to be your president.	No
7841	Again this year, we passed a bill in the Senate Congress and he died on the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
19661	So there are a lot of good things in this bill that we should have done instead of trying this massive and massive takeover by the federal government.	No
18500	He was in Afghanistan, he went to Iraq.	No
2744	I'll get incomes up again.	No
12464	I'm running to do things for America.	No
8280	You - Mr. Truman arrived at the office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were faced in the United States during this transition period - 1946 when price control was lifted - so it is quite difficult to use an overall figure taking seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	No
27387	We're now at under 285.	Yes
25065	Indeed, he was on this side almost throughout his years in the Senate.	No
12439	Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	No
5889	Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	No
5580	Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	Yes
810	25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	No
22476	Since I proposed this format, I hope you all enjoyed it.	No
16923	That, I think, is a good balance.	No
26033	Their idea was to impose higher costs on everyone in their budget that I vetoed.	Yes
8381	Not reducing the interest -	No
521	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	No
8883	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	No
32322	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	Yes
1445	This means that there will be increased hiring.	No
24602	We have increased funding for AIDS.	Yes
8810	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	No
29502	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	Yes
14618	I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.	No
10259	I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	No
21340	It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.	Yes
23718	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	Yes
34098	I don't think that's in our best interests, and I don't think that's smart to do.	No
29927	But let me just tell you.	No
5896	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	Yes
3607	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you neglect the people who are really struggling right now, I think it's a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford four more.	Yes
12800	But if we fail the responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we will have to shoulder our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and we may have to do underground testing.	No
22136	We have to have our people at work.	No
29190	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	No
21714	I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	No
23175	Issues of medical responsibility are a problem, a major problem.	Yes
3958	So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
19493	I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	No
16679	We believe that you can maintain the line and limit federal spending, reduce taxes and have a balanced budget by 1978.	No
18148	Can I answer that?	No
24099	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including many Republican and Democratic business leaders, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope of putting America back to work and increasing our incomes instead of falling.	Yes
15728	We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	Yes
16895	It seems to me that in this election the emphasis should not be on executive power, but corrections should come when voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their American senator.	No
16136	There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	No
25974	He came down and gave a speech to people who were on his side saying I did the wrong thing.	No
12257	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	No
8993	Going through this country, I think I found great hunger in America for spiritual renewal.	No
33651	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	No
18347	They will not follow someone whose beliefs are constantly changing because of American politics.	No
26061	You can be on welfare.	No
16721	There ought to be a standardized design.	No
11057	It has not worked for America.	No
24292	When we think of Russia, remember that we are thinking of many countries now.	No
18591	You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.	No
23316	We have all kinds of gifts.	No
4153	We do not know what the health status of the dear leader is today, but we know that the North Koreans have violated all the agreements they have reached.	Yes
13188	My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	No
28468	I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk in a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be a man enlisted in the U.S. Army.	No
19201	Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	Yes
11118	Teddy Roosevelt said he was walking softly -- talking softly, but wearing a big stick.	No
5718	You have to tell me once that you have stood up with the leaders of your party on a single major issue.	No
14603	We rank first in the country in terms of employment growth, we got the lowest spending, the state and local authorities, in the country, and the second lowest tax burden.	Yes
6394	You know, in the last 20 months, you've invited me home.	No
27654	And what we said was to change those certifications.	No
4340	That's going to be critical.	No
26417	We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.	Yes
20839	And a lot of public schools are responding to the call.	Yes
2135	My grandfather died a while back.	No
7503	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	No
32852	This is the only one country he's ever known.	No
16358	This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	No
16799	We have the highest inflation in 25 years, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	Yes
34410	But what Donald proposes with these massive tax cuts will result in an additional $20 trillion in national debt.	Yes
20509	First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	No
33162	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	No
19630	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	No
24212	Give me a chance to create these kinds of jobs in America.	No
7726	Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	Yes
24030	And I don't want to do that.	No
8023	It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.	No
3523	The -- and I simply disagree fundamentally.	No
13598	I believe that we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we do not just ask the Americans and the richest foreign companies to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new factories, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing and middle-class families; and we have $140 billion in spending cuts.	Yes
10632	That's part of your mistrust.	No
2991	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relations, it would include all shipments of all the material.	No
4397	And they know I'll take care of it.	No
28085	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	No
20536	Electors will know that I will put competent judges on the bench.	No
19445	But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	No
891	We will have the opportunity to see them in action in a friendly forum, in a wonderful and friendly way like this one.	No
18663	we'd be in a stronger place today.	No
27256	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	Yes
15670	And I have a huge difference with the ACLU in their political agenda.	No
9934	I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	No
8936	We have a document in support of my economic speech a few weeks ago in Chicago, which gives all the figures.	No
20700	Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.	No
19611	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	Yes
32839	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	Yes
23230	They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	No
25205	Should the age and endurance of the president be a problem in the political campaign?	No
23407	If you're a business in St. Louis who works, who's trying to find a job here, there's actually an incentive for you to leave.	No
158	Allow the President to set priorities for where we spend.	No
26981	I am not talking about how we are going to face the challenges that exist in the Middle East and take advantage of the opportunity, and stem the wave of violence.	No
25351	It's now 121/4, and I expect it to come down a little bit more soon.	Yes
16689	He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	Yes
4169	We will take a look.	No
7603	Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	No
271	And I wish they had time to let me explain.	No
22742	Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
29989	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	Yes
12401	And I'm going to try to do better.	No
15634	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be someone who is willing to make these difficult choices.	No
7337	This Chair is the first Chair not to meet with ANACP.	Yes
16235	You remember the Boston senator singing there and the ridiculous factor of that Texas lady who was there; I mean, come on, it was just scandalous.	No
16499	Mr Ford is changing his previous philosophy considerably.	Yes
17717	And I don't have time to answer as far as the disabled are concerned.	No
1921	It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.	Yes
23351	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think will happen over time, that technology will change our way of life for the good of the environment.	No
8197	We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	Yes
22248	And we put up with that.	No
22146	You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	No
12270	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	No
6932	I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	No
24039	But when the tables are turned, I should do my part.	No
25807	Over the next four years, I want to focus on the following.	No
19270	It's not a Wall Street tax reduction.	No
8602	I do not want to see the day when it is sixty percent of ours, seventy-five-five and ninety percent of ours, with all the strength and all the power it could bring to cause our destruction.	No
12141	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has decreased, while the percentage of uninsured in America has increased.	Yes
23901	I said something the other day that I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I interviewed -- I said it that way; I think it's wrong to protest against your own country or to organize demonstrations against your own country on foreign soil.	No
19645	Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	No
33376	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	Yes
24409	But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	No
2241	One last point I would like to raise.	No
9759	I promised I'd go into the excesses of Wall Street, and we've passed the most difficult reforms of Wall Street since the 1930s.	Yes
10312	I want a high salary, highly skilled jobs.	No
10665	We can work on nuclear power plants.	No
3822	We've spent more than $600 billion so far, and soon we'll be a trillion dollars.	Yes
21211	And like John McCain, I've learned from experience, and it's not a new job for me.	No
19139	For example, we have reduced the size of the federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	Yes
30461	I'll be able to do it.	No
21746	From the beginning, the American people must say they want to.	No
17846	The answer to that was obviously no, and therefore I was elected to this post and promised a new start.	No
3100	But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	No
21615	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should do for the cities.	No
11037	And in his short career, he doesn't understand our national security challenges.	No
32116	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	No
13625	But not by raising taxes.	No
29594	That I can tell you.	No
12822	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	No
17304	A minister who is in civil law or the Conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do so, I admire.	No
24354	That was their response to that sort of action.	No
29152	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	Yes
21032	It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	Yes
26708	And with regard to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	No
26622	Only half of the people in this country have pension schemes.	Yes
27353	Keep in mind that our military spending has increased every year that I have been on duty.	Yes
19670	I signed a bill to put an end to these deliveries by car when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's health insurance plan, which would have forced many elderly people to take care of their families and took much more money from their pockets and led to health insurance wilting on the vine.	Yes
20644	I believe that the role of the army is to fight and win the war and thus to prevent war from occurring in the first place.	No
9214	And we would have lost a million jobs.	Yes
4118	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we should examine contacts with Iran.	No
27374	I went to the Olympic Games that were unbalanced, and we got it in balance, and we did it.	No
24606	So I can't tell you where it came from, but I'm very concerned about AIDS and I think we have the best researchers in the world at NIH working on the problem.	No
26629	I hope that over the next ten years you will see a sharp increase in the percentage of people with pension plans, as well as a secure social security system.	No
7744	Look at the votes of the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	No
26391	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	No
30103	I have to take it.	No
11577	Now, have I got that wrong?	No
3988	And, John, I... you're absolutely right that the presidents must be careful in what they say.	No
21887	I think we should do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	No
26961	And, of course, Iran on the way to a nuclear weapon, we have real (inaudible).	Yes
12519	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	No
9203	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	No
895	But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.	No
8472	Forty-four Democrats voted, one Republican voted.	Yes
28354	(LAUGHTER) Just add all the numbers.	No
6112	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	Yes
417	But if we spend, spend and spend, it will end the housing market, and we will return immediately to the days of the index of misery and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on this one.	No
6085	Now, old man, Joe, Joe the plumber, is over there.	No
12705	The very small effect of this week's action on the Cuban economy - I believe Castro can very easily replace these markets across Latin America, Europe and Eastern Europe.	No
23521	I know the morality that raises this question, and I respect it very much.	No
12927	The President failed; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	Yes
11742	I think it's better now than in general.	No
3077	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	Yes
8916	In the second quarter, we had a consumer price index of about 12%.	Yes
27097	We are playing the leadership role.	No
23708	That is why Senator Hagel, a Republican, says, you know: beyond the pitiful, beyond the embarrassment, in the dangerous area.	No
8978	And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	Yes
22991	The Patriot Act is vital.	No
1059	But I can say that, uh - I'm doing my best to get through it, and over the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running television ads and newspaper ads based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	No
27127	They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	No
26912	Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.	No
2336	This is one of Dodd-Frank's unintended consequences.	Yes
2093	Now I also like green energy, but it's worth about 50 years of what oil and gas get.	Yes
26071	It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.	Yes
22449	I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	No
9889	We all understand what this country has become because talents from around the world want to come here.	No
21854	I think medical care should go with the person.	No
3445	And I do have a sad note tonight.	No
3295	Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.	No
20509	First of all, on the question of partial or so-called late birth or abortion, I would sign a law prohibiting this procedure, provided that doctors have the capacity to save a woman's life or to act if her health is seriously at risk.	No
1035	Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	No
15464	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	Yes
15512	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	No
8086	They represent something.	No
3020	And I would make sure that the Saudis understood it in advance so that there was no doubt in their minds.	No
9823	What about economic growth?	No
17886	Well, if you're rich, you're better.	No
26116	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	No
19941	I believe that the objective of the policy is to give people the tools they need to make the most of their lives; to strengthen the values of opportunity and responsibility; and to build a sense of community so that we all work together.	No
15384	That is all he says is a simple guarantee of equal opportunities that characterizes the democratic art, and that is a very important commitment of me, contrary to the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the long-standing politics of his own party.	No
32460	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	No
10695	I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	No
10751	This means looking at (ph) on the expenditure side, but also on the revenue side.	No
15536	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we were called upon to take as candidates.	No
17194	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	No
24018	I cut defense expenses.	Yes
16024	I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	Yes
25881	We're down to 336 ships.	Yes
24849	And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	No
24462	So I think we need to strengthen the family.	No
22460	And we have got to put our nation back to work.	No
23716	And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	No
16594	I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	No
22811	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	No
23779	And abroad, we're at war.	No
21706	In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	Yes
25039	And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.	No
6122	So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	No
21264	There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	No
18661	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	No
2293	One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	Yes
16369	I never dreamed that one day I would win this nomination and be my party's presidential candidate.	No
10075	That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.	No
1740	It's a tax in itself.	No
366	But he will take a president who has committed himself to housing, who has had experience in building and rehabilitating housing that understands that affordable housing for low-income and moderate-income families, for young families, first-time homebuyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	No
22904	Daniel, I don't support a draft.	No
30144	Now it's in over 30 countries.	Yes
32825	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's gonna happen.	No
4021	And that was August, a year ago.	No
6510	No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	No
8844	I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.	No
29697	But we must also recognize, in addition to the challenges we face in policing, that there are so many good and courageous police officers who also want reform.	No
10560	What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?	No
16055	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	No
405	When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?	No
25917	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done so, his last statement, calls for an unconditional end to violence and calls on the parties to continue to speak as they should and to have a resolution.	No
17480	I think it can't work, won't work, and will lead to all sorts of cynical escapes from the law.	No
18882	And I've never wavered in my life.	No
16393	Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	No
24958	It hurt this country, and a president is supposed to command.	No
8584	I believe that when we look at the democratic platform, when we look at the proposals that it discussed this evening, when we compare them to the proposals that I have made, those proposals that it makes would not lead to greater growth for this country than if we followed the programmes that I have advocated.	No
27098	We organized the Friends of Syria.	No
8523	I think that this is an issue to which we should continue to give a great deal of care and attention.	No
15180	I am not talking of scrapping.	No
27500	And I've been very clear to them.	No
11087	Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
23608	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	No
17716	We're going to see that it doesn't.	No
26084	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	No
7589	Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.	Yes
460	And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	No
33280	You should meet some of the women I've met, women I've known all my life.	No
8308	We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
1692	Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	No
25322	And I supported this bill.	Yes
21561	I've been working on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person here who hasn't been in Washington in any way for 20 years.	Yes
19481	But let's look at the facts here.	No
18119	He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	No
1219	I think it is right to say that the law on striptease mines that was passed twice by Congress - and which was only two votes, I think, to be out of date - would have been good for the country.	Yes
3515	I don't think that's the case.	No
32834	Take a look at the state of New York.	No
25970	Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	Yes
754	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	No
5768	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	Yes
23172	He said he was for... you're now for the capping of punitive damages?	No
24404	And I swore something because I learned something from Vietnam.	No
21031	The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.	Yes
8474	In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.	No
12648	And we have been on the whole, interestless.	No
26117	I think the most important thing to emphasize, however, is that we must also help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we cannot have a tax reduction that is not paid for.	No
13252	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	Yes
18559	The deadline I set -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he made another mistake tonight about what I said.	No
19764	The violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	No
7726	Now, at the special session of Congress and also at its predecessor session, the Democratic Congress - in which there is a two-to-one democratic majority - was asked by the Speaker to give us the funds and to give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, and at the special session in which Senator Kennedy called the signals, together with Senator Johnson, they refused and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been examined, that he had already had hearings, and Congress already knew what he had before him.	Yes
24905	I think that the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we give instructions for the assassins hired, the hiring of criminals, and the rest - all this has strengthened our opponents.	Yes
3585	That is why we have, as I said, people under indictment and federal charges.	No
16686	Uh - last year we had a deficit of $65 billion - the largest deficit in our country's history - more than one deficit expenditure we had over the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
7617	And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.	Yes
605	I can tell him some I'm against.	No
16671	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	Yes
22274	At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	No
17535	I objected to the grain embargo in my administration.	Yes
3750	We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq, with a surplus of $79 billion.	Yes
20466	The administration didn't take care of it.	Yes
20759	All those who pay taxes should benefit from tax relief.	No
16582	But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	No
28833	With all due respect, Governor, it's a red herring.	No
33749	Donald bought steel and Chinese aluminum.	Yes
29510	And -- as soon as the audit is complete, it will be published.	No
19910	But it is a very liberal administration.	No
15530	But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	No
16811	One of his bills that was cancelled - he got only one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, Republicans.	Yes
12993	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this administration as in the previous one.	Yes
6041	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	Yes
23853	My State is now ranked first in terms of employment growth this year, fourth in terms of income growth, fourth in terms of poverty reduction, third in terms of overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	Yes
21235	I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	No
12109	Secondly -- and they're good.	No
32149	No, I'm a gentleman, Hillary.	No
26208	Because you got a big tax increase.	Yes
14037	I don't think it's in the interests of the American people.	No
28200	Health care must therefore be affordable and available.	No
22809	"I remember sitting at the White House looking at these generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	No
26728	I think it was -- before I arrived, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	No
19409	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	No
19820	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	No
33803	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	No
20996	But it started for me over the last eight years when I had the honour of voting to put an end to the old economic plan here at home and to put in place a new economic plan that helped us make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity of all time.	Yes
11216	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	No
27038	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	No
23715	There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	No
13419	The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	Yes
29559	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	No
3267	The United States must maintain full access to the Panama Canal.	No
8162	I want us to get that picture back.	No
21653	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	No
21601	But here's something we can be very proud of because he really has access to what you're talking about.	No
6787	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	No
17480	I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	No
20101	When I came to the presidency, I said that we were going to cut the deficit by half in four years; we reduced the deficit by 60%.	Yes
7676	About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	Yes
19527	Now, I understand that it was extended until some time next year.	Yes
20388	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid, and in the meantime we will have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime, it could be a year or two.	No
5515	Ensure that CEOs will not be enriched by this process.	No
17690	One last point if I can.	No
9277	20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.	Yes
18217	We didn't need that tax reduction.	No
22901	Now, forget all this talk about a draft.	No
21015	We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.	Yes
23346	They're not taken care of.	No
34061	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	Yes
5730	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	Yes
2063	And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	No
5548	Let me tell you what I'm gonna do.	No
34006	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	Yes
8964	It has increased at a faster pace than spending in the federal government.	Yes
16238	We had fun with Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn, and they got up and sang, went to small towns and I talked about agriculture.	No
26603	You need to be very careful about this because you need to protect people who are already in the queue.	No
17148	I don't think Mr. Mondale has a plan to balance the budget; he has a plan to increase taxes.	No
1361	You shouldn't be penalizing the legitimate owner of a handgun in the process.	No
1165	At that time, no one thought I had a chance to win.	No
18550	Now that's what we have to do.	No
8667	Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	Yes
28280	It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	Yes
19801	And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.	No
7109	To say that borders are not as protected as before 11 September shows that it does not know borders.	No
33616	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	Yes
17004	It is not America that we must have in the future.	No
13761	But I don't think it's fair.	No
23826	I go into this race like their servant, and I belong to them.	No
33782	First of all, what he has just said about the State Department is not only false, it has been found many times.	Yes
15151	Indeed, the Senate Committee on Armed Services voted 10 votes to none, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty and stated that it was not in the interests of the national security of the United States.	Yes
27983	I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	No
11860	And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	No
29810	I'd like to respond to that.	No
18336	What does he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	No
3070	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	No
19039	If America shows uncertainty or weakness over this decade, the world will drift towards tragedy.	No
29224	They're leaving, and they're leaving in more numbers than ever.	Yes
33501	I find that just absolutely...	No
8119	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: do we do everything we can?	No
28332	So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	No
16666	I don't know where that money would come from.	No
28144	You choose your own doctor, and no one can take that away from you.	No
10818	We've got to sit down together across the table.	No
7733	Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	No
8211	Now it's not still.	No
27990	I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	No
188	"It's up to me to be flexible in Medicaid so that people at the bottom of the range can buy there and get their needs covered, and then also - I don't want to see us mandate at all levels that every company has to do, because I really think marginal operators will go and say, ""We can't do it."""	No
27287	And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	No
32265	They'll never be the same.	No
3171	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	No
14760	Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?	No
21556	But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	No
13816	Is the guy out of work better off?	No
16443	Secondly, we must commit ourselves in the private sector to cooperating with the government in areas such as housing.	No
33944	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	No
1886	That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	No
34278	This would take a lot of negotiation.	No
8977	And I think that being governor of California is probably the closest thing to the presidency, if possible, to any executive employment in America today - because it is the most populous state.	No
27727	That is why we brought more cases against China for breach of trade rules than the other - the previous administration did in two terms.	Yes
32104	Oh, you didn't delete them?	No
24190	You see, we have a conflicting relationship between government and business.	No
4319	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	No
381	We went out and built houses.	No
17245	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	Yes
6225	These are clear votes that Senator Obama voted, I believe, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of the American public.	No
1523	They are on the civilian labour market and they are not fighting anywhere in the world today.	No
8299	They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	No
12602	It contains 25 per cent of all members of the General Assembly.	Yes
24136	I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	No
24330	There's no question about that.	No
28782	That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	No
17626	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	Yes
19433	And we have a responsibility.	No
10561	This is not the end of the process, it is the beginning of the process.	No
13458	Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	No
16238	We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	No
1489	I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	Yes
7091	The American middle-class family is not doing this right now, Bob.	No
1603	We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer these very difficult questions.	No
19146	I supported a significant increase in the safe and drug-free school program.	Yes
642	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for the advanced Cruise missile.	No
3919	What he said was a rusher...	No
29746	No, the argument is that we have to remove weapons from those people who have them and it's bad people who shouldn't have them.	No
13417	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	Yes
1403	But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	No
18394	And our alliance is strong.	No
31911	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	No
20035	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	No
19827	So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	No
21412	When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.	No
12429	I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	No
18262	And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.	No
25916	I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful, and I'm not here to discuss the president with an ongoing foreign policy issue.	No
10529	We must stop this greed and excess.	No
1256	We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	Yes
34346	He was criticizing President Reagan.	Yes
12445	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have a new responsibility, test the students.	No
6845	People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	No
32282	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	Yes
29611	It's because it's time for this country to have someone who manages it that has an idea about the money.	No
23719	Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	No
14497	We need to turn around.	No
12766	America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	No
7974	I would also like to point out that, with respect to Senator Kennedy's comments, I think he has a perfect right and responsibility to criticize the Administration whenever he thinks we are wrong.	No
21884	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	No
24543	There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	Yes
24978	I have said on several occasions exactly what I believe of the Soviet Union.	No
14809	I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	No
9085	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	No
15355	This is a contest between a democrat in my party, as shown by my actions at the Oval Office over the last four years, unlike Governor Reagan, who, in most cases, characterizes his party, but in some cases, he radically departs from the legacy of Eisenhower and others.	No
23370	Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	No
15908	Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	No
5500	Now we've allocated $750 billion.	Yes
27851	We in this country can successfully compete with anyone in the world, and we will do so.	No
20758	That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.	No
14107	I'm gonna take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airline thing straightened out, because it's important to this country.	No
16580	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	No
20267	I am proud to work with the Republicans and Democrats, what our nation needs.	Yes
16057	I've appointed more than 130 people, so I have a record.	Yes
26643	people get so tired of politics.	No
12059	It's really a matter of culture.	No
9216	But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	No
14970	The figures that the President has just used about California are a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than spending in Georgia while Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	Yes
33191	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	No
22345	I think if Barbara Bush was here this year, she would be elected.	No
26321	It will increase by 39 per cent, and social security will increase by 34 per cent.	No
11818	But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	No
27970	I want to see peace grow in this country.	No
33804	Take a look at the migration.	No
27408	And so the question is not a Battle game, where we count slides.	No
33048	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	No
29964	But, frankly, I'm looking -- I'm looking at this, and I'm saying, isn't it amazing?	No
15539	More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	Yes
6193	It is very likely that one of us will make at least one and probably more than one appointment and Roe against Wade is probably in balance.	No
16041	But what I would do is name people on the federal bench who will not legislate on the bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	No
15627	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I have won many elections, I have lost some, as you know, and I have learned from these losses.	No
12837	We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.	No
28396	Because the tax code is unfair to people at the bottom of the economic ladder.	No
13349	He can issue an injunction if there is a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can continue; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he goes to Congress.	No
2062	Well, I want to do the same, but I actually identified how we can do this.	No
16570	I think we have given them a good opportunity - we are - I don't think we should go any further.	No
822	He says,â€°Â¥Well, let's admit that the administration did business with Noriega.	Yes
3020	And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	No
199	But, George, that's not an answer.	No
11014	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	No
16778	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	Yes
28944	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- the governor about a few things that have been done over the last eight years, as if the promises I made eight years ago had not been kept.	Yes
13837	So the General Motors experience is relevant.	No
708	We don't make those choices.	No
11428	We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.	Yes
19834	Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.	No
32664	She talks in favor of the rebels.	Yes
8494	Sometimes we - we believe that by moving programs to the House or Senate, it is simply a legislative finalization and all that kind of thing.	No
7511	And I ask you to commit yourself to this journey with me.	No
33598	And we're going to work hard to make sure that's the case, because we're going to go where the money is.	No
17528	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	No
18832	Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	No
13932	I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.	No
1394	Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	No
15417	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	No
23554	"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	Yes
22272	It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	No
29927	But let me tell you.	No
17484	Every American must be aware of the seriousness of the process.	No
5911	And, therefore, his constant model throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	No
28345	And as part of my plan, four years from now, as a percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the lowest in 50 years.	No
10203	When... when he was asked the size of the class...	No
29278	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all those places where so many of their jobs and businesses go, they're gone.	Yes
13842	But let's take my life in perspective.	No
31932	And many Republicans and independents said the same thing.	Yes
16953	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	Yes
15101	What I think should be done, once they are safe here with their families, and this tragedy is over - we endured this humiliation just to miss a week of a year now - then, I think, it's time for us to have a full investigation into the diplomatic efforts that were made at the beginning, why they were there so long, and when they came home, what do we have to do to do that - what arrangements have been made?	No
28240	We have huge difference between us on this question.	No
27263	And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
18301	The President and I have always agreed on this point.	No
27441	They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	No
28407	Now, I don't think anyone here is earning more than $330,000 a year.	No
3713	We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	No
27526	It's probably the biggest thug that's ever been told in this campaign.	No
21844	And my program is this one.	No
15304	As long as there is a democratic president in the White House, we will have a strong and viable social security system, free from the threat of bankruptcy.	No
21497	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	No
10619	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole series of new spending, but in fact, I'm cutting more than I'm spending to make it a net reduction in spending.	Yes
19616	I gave about six months before the date of entry into force of the act before prosecutions could be brought, even if they are in force now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	Yes
4400	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	No
20753	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	Yes
9251	And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	Yes
15600	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility that will build a good solid foundation under which this country, or over which country can move, grow, invest and build the best America for its people and for our children and grandchildren.	No
13254	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	No
15766	I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	No
33891	That's not what America is.	No
15490	We have a lot to do to intensify this war, to double the number of anti-drug officers, to fight here and abroad, to work with our neighbours in this hemisphere.	No
16785	Governor Carter complains about the deficits this administration has had.	No
9137	And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	No
22631	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	No
6775	I think the choice is a woman's choice.	No
33029	And look at our miners.	No
29611	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	No
15047	But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	No
20345	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	No
7196	And yet, the president talking about No Child Left Behind has refused to fully fund -- $28 billion -- this particular program so that you can make a difference in the lives of these young people.	Yes
21763	We've got to do something about it.	No
28048	It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	Yes
10698	And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	No
2894	What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	No
17697	I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	No
20069	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	No
3751	It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	No
24075	I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	No
12720	Mr Edwards, I don't think it's a good idea for presidential candidates to appoint his cabinet members prospectively, or suggest four people - indicate that one of them will surely be appointed.	No
26516	You're going to have to watch it.	No
18156	What message does that send to Iraqis?	No
1259	And I am in favour of shifting the cost of the well-being of local communities.	No
27631	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	Yes
18954	No, I don't think it's okay, and I said it publicly.	No
2535	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for nation-state by state.	No
19781	That is why my balanced budget plan will continue to invest and develop this economy.	No
22411	I'm convinced because I don't want it to get out of my time.	No
15370	But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	No
7849	Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	No
32211	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	Yes
26419	We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	Yes
19276	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	Yes
3175	And we not only have problems at home, but we export these problems abroad.	No
29758	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	No
10696	But understand this: We must also examine where some of our tax revenues go.	No
21329	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	No
28827	And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.	No
153	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	No
23950	Your father was right to defend himself against Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	No
22313	Just a clarification of fact very quickly.	No
24789	I don't like to see the country's principles violated.	No
27115	I don't anticipate that in the future.	No
14840	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	No
25780	Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	No
22480	They're not going to be solved overnight.	No
26949	We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	No
12014	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks on weapons sold in the future.	Yes
16553	The amnesty program I recommended in Chicago in September 1974 would give all military crooks and deserters the opportunity to win their right file.	Yes
19626	We have not been firm and strong.	No
6912	You want to get used to it, you can.	No
8872	I am pleased to say that, contrary to this, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, a programme for the 1980s, has spent a lot of time, and in very specific details, we have talked about two things that should be done to help urban America.	Yes
10915	And as far as nuclear energy is concerned, look at the file again.	No
16886	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion dollars Congress in the history of the United States.	No
20961	It was an emergency, wasn't it?	No
33375	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
23413	Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.	Yes
24008	That must be fair.	No
11405	I didn't start naming names except for one person, and it was Mr. Richard Cheney I thought I did a good job the other night.	No
31940	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	Yes
1170	And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	No
4130	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	Yes
17216	Our policy was not to reduce subsidies.	No
7134	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	Yes
9628	I have to be able to go home at five so I can be there to prepare dinner for my children and be with them when they get home from school.	No
24451	I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	No
11929	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law as we do in Texas, we will go after any crime.	No
16867	It is my understanding that Governor Carter, while Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	Yes
2588	And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	No
17097	Over the past 21 months, more than 6 million people have found a job - there have been new jobs for these people where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the army.	Yes
23920	So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	No
3328	And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
12472	The warning signs are clear.	No
16677	We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.	Yes
15237	The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	Yes
12820	But with regard to underground tests to develop peaceful uses of atomic energy, we must not allow this Soviet filibust to continue.	No
10571	We will have to coordinate with other countries to ensure that all the measures we take work.	No
25942	In fact, in 1992, we had before us a bill that all states had to respect or that they were going to lose money.	Yes
28923	If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	No
17182	There were two or three commission reports, recommendations from the CIA, the State Department and others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	Yes
16398	There's a lot to do.	No
25811	This could protect 3 million families, 700,000 children.	Yes
17158	And of course, what happened just after the election was that they proposed to reduce social security benefits by 25 percent -- to reduce the inflation adjustment, to reduce the minimum social security benefits for the poorest, to eliminate education benefits for dependents whose widows were trying to get them to university.	Yes
16617	But this was a significant change from administrative jobs to service delivery.	Yes
27874	...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...	No
533	But it takes presidential leadership.	No
16167	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	Yes
12907	But he also voted in favour of an amendment - which was fortunately lost - that would have drawn a line and excluded those islands and denied the President the right to defend those islands if he thought it was an attack on Formosa.	Yes
6254	But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	No
8080	Well, let me say that I think the parties are important in that they say something about the program and something about the man.	No
12644	I believe that the world is changing fast.	No
21845	Keeping the government as far as possible, making insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, the next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and embarking on the business of pooling insurance.	No
1512	A moment ago, for example, he indicated that unemployment was very low in the 1950s.	No
18039	I am proud of those important military figures who support me in this race: former Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; again yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, supported me; Admiral General William Crown; and General Tony McBeak, who led the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe that I would make a stronger commander in chief.	Yes
24593	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	Yes
23010	That's why I'll never stop at anything to track down and kill terrorists.	No
23329	I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	Yes
14759	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	Yes
9650	You know a big difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington deciding the health care choices women make.	No
27783	And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	No
16868	My average in two years is twenty-six.	Yes
27777	Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.	No
13894	I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	Yes
11664	I thought the best example of how to deal with the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, which we alone can provide.	No
23436	He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	No
2724	And everyone gets a fair share -- everyone makes a fair share, and everyone plays according to the same rules.	No
22202	But he's not gonna do the job if we don't change K up to 12.	No
29048	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	No
6357	But I do not agree with him on this, because the evidence does not show that it really solves the problem -- the cornerstone of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program by 2,000 slots.	Yes
33648	We're going to have trade, but we're going to -- we're going to put an end to it, we're going to make a big deal.	No
22616	Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.	Yes
14497	We've got to turn this thing around.	No
20037	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	No
27438	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	No
17910	That's not fair for our future.	No
10119	More recently, in Aurora.	No
22367	It's supposed to be the year of women in the Senate.	No
12691	We can do what we did with Guatemala.	No
3653	You need to look at our file.	No
14618	I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.	No
6084	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	No
23056	"""I think it makes sense."	No
8599	Mr. Nixon argued that Soviet production is only forty-four per cent of ours.	Yes
19039	If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	No
15055	It is clear that we still have a long way to go to fully integrate minority groups into American life.	No
16545	Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	Yes
29299	Will they create jobs in America?	No
8947	Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.	Yes
15119	Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	No
896	But you talk about judgment.	No
26846	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	No
23640	In other words, if you're a mother and you're pregnant and you're killed, the murderer is tried on two cases, not just one.	Yes
14466	Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	No
3808	The consequences of the defeat would have been an increased influence of Iran.	No
24593	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't want to fight it, but those out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong supporter of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clarify that -- have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	Yes
33854	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	No
17521	I do not think that any of us should be called upon here to make a decision on what other things might come under the tradition of self-defence.	No
12559	Again, we turn to the past.	No
23537	I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way.	No
21934	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	No
14258	That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	No
3670	Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	No
3869	I fear that Senator Obama does not understand the difference between tactics and strategies.	No
15871	They're not on the left or on the right.	No
24413	We're working through the international organizations.	No
27804	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason why we were able to pivot towards the Asia-Pacific region after ending the war in Iraq and leaving Afghanistan is precisely because it will be a zone of massive growth in the future.	No
8531	This is a problem that will continue to be a problem for the years to come.	No
19837	The people over there are doing well.	No
29573	We'll keep guessing what he's hiding.	No
14827	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	Yes
6083	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	No
33115	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	No
7907	We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.	No
4325	First of all, I think we're safer in a way.	No
21962	I'm glad you clarified it.	No
34241	Aleppo is a disaster.	No
25991	I have voted eight, ten times since 1965.	No
23395	You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	No
30127	But I'm everything for NATO.	No
16790	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	Yes
13616	The government -- it says invest the government, grow the government.	No
18118	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	No
28147	If you're poor, they pay all of it.	Yes
33939	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	No
12261	I think we should fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, half of the money being paid to States so that States can make the right decisions on environmental quality.	No
27985	America will come back, and for this to happen, we will have to have a president who can work through the driveway.	No
3307	I don't know what was right, what was wrong, what was done.	No
26287	We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.	No
20836	That's my vision for public education all around America.	No
27485	And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	No
14218	That is exactly what the President did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	Yes
17802	Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	Yes
34285	But I'm not gonna slam the door on women and children.	No
17570	As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.	No
16603	Medicaid is in one agency; Medicaid is in another.	No
14218	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	Yes
12724	There are many capable men who could be Secretary of State.	No
5896	And that's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chose to associate with a guy who, in 2001, said he would have liked to have bombed more, and that he had a long association with him.	Yes
2414	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	No
28694	I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	No
23785	We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	No
3358	Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	No
24079	And if we don't, we'll spend our children's money.	No
8844	I think one of the problems with cities today is federal aid.	No
1932	And the amount of debt we add, to one trillion a year, is simply not moral.	Yes
24142	Now, we can do better.	No
21073	The governor wants to divert $1 from every $6-in-a-kind into the stock market, which means he would drain a trillion dollars from the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and social security under this approach would be bankrupt within this generation.	Yes
3651	I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	Yes
508	Let me give you another example.	No
21224	It has been a good, lively exchange.	No
27915	What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	No
21415	In other words, we were 18% of them -- 18-24 year olds were less than $12,000.	Yes
33064	We must remain independent of energy.	No
1096	And I said everything I know.	No
14681	It is our obligation to ensure that we give him the best products in the world to put together and that we do not break his legs in the process.	No
3293	Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	No
8466	And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	Yes
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
28717	But if you can check it out, it's real power.	No
8962	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	Yes
34433	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	No
7536	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	No
25565	But, in fact, over the past four years, more weapons have been built, a larger and stronger arms race than in human history.	Yes
20265	And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.	No
19990	But I think there are personal differences.	No
3911	But we cannot do this if we are not ready to return Iraq to its country.	No
20285	And now they're campaigning to get prescription drugs for seniors.	Yes
27872	Actually, it's less likely they're coming here...	No
7522	"He said: ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	No
7977	I think it's very dangerous at a time when Mr Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	No
14838	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	No
34398	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	No
18495	The hardest part of my job is to know that I have hurt the troops and to do my best to comfort the loved ones who have lost a son, daughter, husband or wife.	No
6552	It's called bait and exchange.	No
18581	There are 100,000 trained soldiers, police, guards, special units, border patrol.	Yes
3309	This is uh - what the American people want.	No
16671	As the economy improves and improves, our gross national product will grow by an average of about 6 per cent over last year.	Yes
24760	Governor Clinton clicked on things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	No
32739	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who supported me.	Yes
3048	We believe that there must be an ongoing obligation towards the people, some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	No
27104	And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	Yes
19808	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	Yes
10143	We were able to lead our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	Yes
18101	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	No
21767	Send us some people who will pass the idea.	No
19296	I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	No
13501	Today, there is no shortage of dollars, yet many of these countries continue to oppose our goods.	Yes
24	We've got to get after the users more.	No
2651	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	No
12575	I have sustained it since then.	Yes
3800	I went to Iraq in 2003 and I came back and said we had to change that strategy.	No
1793	When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	Yes
25088	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	Yes
8216	And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	No
612	And under me, when I run this country, the Secretary of Defense will have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survival of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever.	No
4001	It's gonna change when I'm president of the United States.	No
20841	This is the role of the federal government.	No
13897	And let me say this.	No
33388	There are limited places where this was appropriate.	No
16993	And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	No
3480	So, for viewers watching, I'm optimistic about the ability to get together with a plan.	No
24998	They say they're not.	Yes
23908	When I make a mistake I'll admit it.	No
16640	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had about five hundred and forty employees.	Yes
14877	Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	No
26355	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	No
25941	Maybe they're dangerous -- I've voted for everything ever since.	Yes
168	Well, I hope that all the Americans who look at us, listen to us and try to decide on which one of us should be President of the United States listens very carefully to the Vice-President.	No
8313	I think Mr. Benson's program failed.	No
79	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	Yes
1970	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	No
33446	We never had anything like this in our elections.	Yes
22115	Yes, we got problems at home.	No
24609	"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	No
19722	I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	No
11013	And in this situation, what is happening is that the protections you have, the protections of the consumers you need, you are not going to have at your disposal.	No
32154	And I'm gonna fix it, because I agree with you.	No
19475	There was only one suit under the Brady -- one under the ban on assault weapons and only seven under the Brady Bill you talk about all the time.	Yes
27259	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	No
26204	That's what you like, you have a perfect candidate.	No
12641	There's not a single U.S. diplomatic representative in those six.	Yes
23203	Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.	No
22181	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	No
24033	But let us not cut into the muscle, and let us not reduce our insurance policy, which is the participation of American forces in NATO, the largest peacekeeping organization ever made.	No
3459	He must be responsible and supervised.	No
1747	Middle-income families are being crushed.	No
8236	It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
16702	I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.	Yes
8730	All of these things can be done.	No
10800	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	Yes
28758	Tell you what I hear.	No
8036	But it didn't mean that.	No
23317	We should shut them down.	No
26925	And that's what we've done in the last four years.	No
17478	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make a woman an abortion crime if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	Yes
11288	Tensions are going to go away.	No
19204	We have record numbers of new small businesses.	Yes
26300	When they had a $250 billion tax system, that's half the size of it.	Yes
10741	And the last point I just want to make.	No
16690	This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	Yes
24133	And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.	No
32536	And all his donors, or most of his donors.	Yes
3284	Someone who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good quarterback.	No
7778	The program that was proposed this summer, after breaking the sugar quota with Cuba, was really done because we wanted to go through the OAS.	Yes
19785	I am very oriented toward the future.	No
16797	He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.	No
17756	Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.	No
25826	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	No
34	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
8586	The one in the health field deserves to be mentioned.	No
14924	When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	Yes
22905	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	No
25050	I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	No
30389	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	No
9018	And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.	Yes
1211	I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.	Yes
16736	So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	No
23510	Now it's not a flip-flop.	No
32786	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	No
2324	We're going to make sure you have a will to live like this -- so we can know how you're going to bring things down if you're making a bad bet so we don't have any other bailouts from taxpayers.	No
6994	I will not privatize it.	No
18260	You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	No
13738	And the people who have work...	No
6222	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	No
16560	It seemed to me that if I had to deal adequately and effectively with the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give one hundred percent of my time to these two major problems.	No
334	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	No
15860	Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.	No
2296	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	Yes
23869	And you can have the right type of experience and the wrong type of experience.	No
14275	Sometimes he has to act.	No
11251	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	No
1455	With all due respect to President Ford, I think he should be ashamed to mention this statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate we have had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the moment when President Ford took office.	Yes
33591	I want us to do more to help small business.	No
26300	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	Yes
17447	But with regard to abortion, and I have the feeling that it was -- there was a reference without naming it here in Mr. Mondale's remarks related to the injection of religion into the government.	No
20201	I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.	No
4158	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	No
32989	They will respect the second amendment and what it represents.	No
25760	They're looking to us for leadership.	No
4320	But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	No
27593	The same way you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more people in there.	Yes
24309	Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	No
13734	Mr. Perot, with all due respect, I think that is very relevant, and I think that a budget of $4 billion in state and federal funds is not as small, and I think that the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and that had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and make the kind of changes that have generated the support of people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett Packard and some of the largest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business leaders, are very relevant.	Yes
1515	This is not the way to end or reduce unemployment.	No
11489	Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	No
29287	Actually, I've been thinking about it a little bit.	No
29805	They're in a lot of trouble.	No
25819	We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.	No
20324	No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	No
2886	I have a little way to go before I start doing this.	No
4017	"And I'm gonna tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman got up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	No
2347	So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	Yes
16589	And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	Yes
13916	I understand how to make things work.	No
8362	There is no way for the presidency.	No
9034	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	No
15030	We have come a long way to correct these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	No
23447	And so when you raise taxes like that, you tax job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	No
28621	It's not the right thing to do.	No
27083	But the Saudis and Qataris, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about that.	No
29965	Because I settled this case without admitting guilt, but it was a lawsuit against many real estate companies, and it's just one of those things.	Yes
11738	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't afford to be overheard.	No
27784	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	No
20587	That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	No
850	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	No
2128	You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.	No
2444	Or, if not, how can the cost of care be made more effective?	No
15314	Now, again, this statement that in one way or another, I wanted to destroy it and I have just changed my mind, that I am for voluntary social security, which would mean the ruin of it.	No
29272	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
3302	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	Yes
33742	I'll be against it when I'm president.	No
32116	I did not do so in the first debate, and I will try not to do so in this debate, because I would like to answer the questions that people presented here tonight to talk to us.	No
23044	And, you know, in 2006 seniors will get coverage for prescription drugs for the first time in Medicare.	Yes
21	And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	No
17038	My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	No
14369	I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	No
24043	The European Community is able to pay much more than it has done in the past.	Yes
29851	But let us also add that no one should disagree on the respect of the rights of young men living in these neighbourhoods.	No
2914	I would restore the concept of fire-side cat, which was an integral part of Franklin Roosevelt's administration.	No
3363	I believe we can and we ought to.	No
14449	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	No
4116	There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.	No
6224	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	No
13282	I'm just saying that the United States should live up to its commitments to the Que-à-- Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
21397	We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	No
29144	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	No
26527	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	No
12032	Like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, Los Angeles...	No
7828	Finally, with regard to the whole problem of the fight against the recession, as you call it, we must use all the government's resources in this regard: first, we must ensure that the credit is expanded as we enter a period of recession - and I understand, I do not believe that we are entering a recession.	No
28387	If you pay taxes, you'll get an advantage.	No
24715	And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	No
6534	223,000 children in Arizona do not have health insurance at all.	Yes
11119	Senator Obama likes to speak loudly.	No
11836	And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.	No
16440	We will never end the inflationary spiral, and we will never have a balanced budget until we bring our people back to work.	No
4047	I know what our needs are.	No
11246	We tend to be reactive.	No
7756	They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	Yes
11079	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	No
10636	This is the most liberal record of major expenses in the U.S. Senate.	Yes
14680	Keep in mind that a factory worker has nothing to do with anything, except to put it in place on the floor of the factory.	No
16676	It endorses the democratic platform which, as I have read, calls for about sixty additional programmes.	Yes
8182	Now last year, of course, was 1958.	No
17369	The President says it'll disappear automatically.	No
13157	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	No
29700	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	Yes
20671	The warning signs are real.	No
19402	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should worry about what happened.	No
28883	You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	No
6631	I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	No
1487	But as happened at the end of the Con-Democratic Convention, the Republican Party united.	No
24653	This is a matter of life and death.	No
26258	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	No
2198	And it's not mine -- only my opinion.	No
641	But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.	No
23604	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the U.S. Constitution in accordance with the law.	No
34297	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	Yes
34392	You look at the kind of numbers that will cost us in the year 17 is a disaster.	No
32167	We need to provide additional support to small businesses so that they can afford to ensure their health.	No
27241	And bringing us back to this kind of strategy that has brought us into this disorder is not the way we will maintain leadership in the 21st century.	No
26411	And my word is good.	No
1720	All this is therefore possible.	No
5805	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in announcements of negative attacks against me.	Yes
10376	And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.	No
3600	I think those are pretty important priorities.	No
10474	You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.	Yes
18765	I want bilateral talks that put all the issues, the 1952 armistice, economic issues, human rights issues, artillery elimination issues, demilitarized zone issues and nuclear issues on the table.	No
1778	So any -- any language on the contrary is simply not accurate.	No
17996	And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.	No
5634	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	No
24685	Then when they do it alone, they say no one did it.	No
27627	So our troops will come home at that point.	Yes
8502	Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.	No
1543	As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	No
13657	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	Yes
30169	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I told him about it -- he said you were totally against war, because he was for war.	Yes
16581	And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	No
25292	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American response that is consistent with justice and due process.	No
21703	I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work as police officers, and I think that as we reduce our military forces, we should let people win their military retirement by leaving and working as police officers.	No
9637	That's what I did.	No
12153	Instead, he directed the money towards a tax reduction, a large part of which went to rich interests.	Yes
15255	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or substantially modify, the exceptional profit tax - to return a significant $227 billion to the oil companies; to remove the Ministry of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuel program; to put a minimum emphasis on solar energy; and to place a strong emphasis on nuclear power plants as a major energy source in the future.	Yes
6144	Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.	No
17605	First of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house market.	No
29377	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	No
18679	The world is more dangerous.	No
20089	I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	No
12763	Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	No
24604	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times more per AIDS victim than per cancer victim.	Yes
8713	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.	Yes
36	I agree with Mr Bush that values are important.	No
8697	And since I made this proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $80, has increased to about $1.30.	Yes
34054	You know, every time Donald thinks things don't go in his direction, he pretends that anything is rigged against him.	No
3657	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	No
1057	But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	No
7656	And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.	No
8089	And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	Yes
17238	Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	Yes
19003	I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence as me.	No
12110	They are very important elements of the health care safety net.	No
12653	They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two and three, they will be more numerous than we are in missiles.	Yes
27855	It's a company, it's not basic research.	No
4020	"And I said, ""I'm gonna -- I'm gonna wear his bracelet with honor."""	No
18728	And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	Yes
848	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	No
8863	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	Yes
11532	And we have maintained the sanctions.	Yes
23084	I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	Yes
150	They make all the expenses, they own every penny and tell us how to spend every penny.	No
16963	You know, of course, that I am the first president in 30 years who has reorganized the federal government's intelligence agencies: the CIA, the Defence Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	Yes
12782	Part of this is because we stayed here, because we didn't encounter our problems in the United States, because we didn't have a moving economy.	No
27464	Secondly, I would take measures of diplomatic isolation.	No
4240	I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	Yes
8158	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	No
18034	And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	No
28160	We have now spent 65 years developing a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% do not.	Yes
16139	Give our farm families a decent income with expenses of $20 to $25 billion per year in agricultural subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	No
13932	I am for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements until the world is dead, and we do not have good trade agreements around the world.	No
7094	And the take-home pay of the richest .	No
5538	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	No
26006	What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.	No
28270	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	No
21499	So I'm not gonna take your time tonight, but let me say that.	No
5987	Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	No
17318	And if I have the opportunity to name her, I will do it the same way I did to choose her.	No
17129	This is the worst trade year in American history by far.	Yes
11846	We got one in Texas.	No
16651	We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.	Yes
3060	In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	No
15059	There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	No
30404	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	Yes
24805	That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	No
25587	It is the key to the strength of our nation.	No
15363	Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	No
24997	We will simply provide a deterrent for them to be too expensive if they deal with ideas of aggression against us.	No
7285	Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.	No
25863	May I ask you a question?	No
33557	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	No
32667	And you know what happens?	No
21918	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	No
14863	But in doing so, we have made sure that we address this issue peacefully, not to inject American military forces into combat, but to allow our nation's strength to feel beneficial.	No
27969	I want to see peace.	No
33940	Why don't you give the money back?	No
16378	We can do better than that.	No
677	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained and well-maintained conventional forces.	No
18430	First of all, we all know that in his state of the trade union message, he spoke to Congress about nuclear materials that did not exist.	Yes
22235	Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	No
18966	Russia is a country in transition.	No
1033	"It was a tremendous outbreak of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	No
12642	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet ambassador arrived that day.	Yes
18137	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	Yes
20245	Our country has cut social spending by half.	Yes
27920	When you came to represent 32 million people on food stamps.	Yes
10962	He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	No
23105	And you'll find a tort reform plan.	No
25813	First of all, let me tell you that you're coming back, Mr. President, talking about a cut in health insurance.	No
25918	The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	No
12470	I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.	No
33783	But I think it's really an important issue.	No
2208	And the president supports the $716 billion withdrawal from this program.	Yes
8689	conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	No
23226	He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
19605	We don't know what's going to happen.	No
30325	So we need to be more specific about how we talk about these issues.	No
13168	We have certainly gone beyond this, and then to a few by proposing to the Soviet Union to control testing, disarmament and in all other ways.	No
8218	I respect the sincerity that he-- he makes this suggestion.	No
17508	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
2847	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than it has been in many years.	Yes
3704	Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	Yes
26116	And these are things I think will do a lot to help America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	No
19010	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	Yes
27686	But we must ensure that, as we send them support, it binds them to make progress on issues that would lead them to become a civil society.	No
19442	And you voted to reduce services to 23 million school children under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act.	Yes
24377	He says he doesn't, but the policies he exposes to put conditions on M.F.N.	Yes
19607	And it seemed to me that if you want to send a signal, you have to send a signal, Mr. President.	No
16011	And it's going to work on surpluses and I don't want the Liberal Democratic Congress to spend from this Social Security Trust Fund or take the money for other purposes.	No
12012	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	No
18464	I do not think he was misleading when he described Iraq as a serious threat in autumn 2002.	No
2174	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	Yes
15175	Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	No
3259	I would never give up full control or practical control of the Panama Canal area, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	No
12977	I do not believe there is any burden, or responsibility, that any American would not take to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	No
16684	I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	Yes
25167	We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	No
15811	I think of Dr. Fauci.	No
6659	"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	No
33254	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	Yes
21618	Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	No
19700	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	Yes
9081	We need to stop drifting.	No
2804	The Soviet Union knows what they want to relax, and they got it.	No
21884	You need to reaffirm your ownership in this country and you need to reform our government completely.	No
19157	We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	Yes
14431	And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.	Yes
27900	No, I am not wrong.	No
13508	Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	No
20488	I think the next president should promote a culture of life in America.	No
3062	But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	No
28767	I think that's the tone.	No
5523	Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	No
30020	No one knows that Russia has entered the DNC.	Yes
15928	And if we can do it and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they should come from, then I think we have the long-term opportunity to start transferring some of our military resources to important domestic priorities that can provide the university opportunity to this young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child who is a first-year student at university, a major in electrical engineering, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep this child at university.	No
28324	We need to have accountability.	No
1302	And that's where there was a great generation of despair, and poor health, and lack of education, lack of determination, and lack of hope for the future.	No
12546	It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	No
33536	She's been outperformed and overjoyed worse than anyone I've ever seen in any government.	No
1190	I think Senator Dole would be more judgmental and discreet than describing a heroic, courageous and remarkable leader of the army.	No
28631	The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	No
17535	I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	Yes
22298	It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	No
3602	But let's go back to the original point.	No
4217	It had everything to do with energy.	No
25516	And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	No
1168	And my first organization was only four or five people, plus my wife and children, my three sons and their wives.	No
15591	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	No
29653	Sometimes there is no direct transfer of business skills to the government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for the government.	No
4230	So this is a very difficult situation.	No
29847	Look, one murder is too many.	No
13257	The answer is that the United States cannot afford to have an es - a lack of espionage or if we should - or should I say - a delay of intelligence - more than we can afford to have a delay of missile.	No
6083	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	No
11993	I think we should re-establish the three-day waiting period under the Brady Act.	No
7489	And I am blessed, as I think the President is blessed, as I said last time.	No
24847	And in the process, as a result of this will, decision and hardness, we now have former enemies talking about peace in the Middle East.	Yes
17579	I can understand why you are, Mr.Mondale, because, as a senator, you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	Yes
1027	Mr Ford's environmental agency planned an unemployment rate of 10% in 1978 if he is president.	Yes
14534	Duration limits for members of the U.S. Congress.	No
6180	That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	No
12060	It is a culture that, somewhere in the line, we have begun to disrespect life.	No
32025	But when you're talking about excuses, I think the one you really should apologize for and the thing you should apologize for are the 33,000 emails you deleted, and you washed the acid, and then the two email boxes and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	Yes
28915	I'm not proud of a record.	No
27551	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	Yes
11217	I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	No
19798	I also want a bridge to the truth.	No
299	See, I would have found a way to sign this bill.	No
14958	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most inflationary ideas ever presented to the American public.	No
16685	The best thing to do is look at Mr. Ford's administration file and Mr. Nixon's before his.	No
1887	Jim, I -- you might want to move on to another subject, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	No
19160	As far as possible, I want to restore power to States and the people.	No
28373	And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	Yes
3265	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	No
33794	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	No
19959	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	No
8970	Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	No
442	I know it's hard and honest people may disagree.	No
9137	And make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	No
15774	You do not make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets will behave themselves.	No
10679	Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.	No
19089	And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.	No
11742	I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	No
23353	We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.	Yes
21629	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	Yes
18142	More in July than June.	Yes
7235	And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	No
14653	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	No
13015	None of them chose a communist government.	Yes
16541	It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	No
1751	Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	No
16409	And I'll be a good president.	No
28149	And I will bring new competition to lower the price.	No
27853	This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	No
24275	You'd go broke in a hurry.	No
16298	An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	No
22721	We're going to train troops, and we are.	No
3824	We have seen 30,000 injured, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, Al-Qaeda is resurrected, stronger today than at any time since 2001.	Yes
4068	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians are continuing on the road to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	No
1052	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	No
17589	And this tax, there is no deduction, so a person who does anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- pays that tax on the full gross income that he or she has already paid a tax on the same amount of money.	Yes
8620	And I don't want historians, in ten years' time, to say that these are the years when the tide has faded for the United States.	No
20014	Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.	No
23981	I questioned his judgment and his character.	No
3791	I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	No
24072	We're trying to solve it.	No
32442	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	No
873	I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	No
12794	We must therefore redouble our efforts.	No
12882	And my judgment is that they don't want to give up their freedom to become communists.	No
17797	As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.	No
2913	These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	No
25538	And I was happy to hear that, because that's what we've been doing since I told the British Parliament that I thought we should do it.	No
654	And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.	No
24704	When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	No
18602	He doesn't have the same thing.	No
3882	They just passed an electoral...	No
1252	When the Nixon-Ford administration started, it was 10%.	Yes
4053	A testimony for you, Jim.	No
3510	Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.	No
10376	And -- and that's part of what's at stake in this election.	No
18652	They outsourced the work to the Afghan warlords, who, just a week earlier, had fought against us, and who did not trust each other.	Yes
18911	I will close this programme, and we will make the world understand that we are serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	No
34247	And a lot of this is due to Hillary Clinton, because what happened is, fighting Assad, which turned out to be a lot harder than she thought, and now she's gonna say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just a lot harder and much smarter than she and Obama.	Yes
920	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	No
9440	Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	Yes
33571	The United States has maintained peace - the United States has maintained peace through our alliances.	Yes
20430	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas into this hemisphere.	No
7208	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
21655	I have spoken to the chairmen of the committees who wish to do so.	No
1730	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax reduction.	Yes
14931	Yet his 1980 economic message indicated that we were going to reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to control inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was over 18%.	Yes
8446	But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.	No
31980	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	No
14429	And we formed a historic coalition, and we sent it down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	Yes
21731	I didn't get to make a comment on this.	No
28512	Soldiers must understand why we're going.	No
19412	We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	Yes
2804	The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.	No
15240	I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	No
21314	There'll be a noise from a job sucker heading south.	No
22112	Right now, we are sending equipment to help these hungry little children in Somalia.	Yes
28038	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	No
20255	That's not what I think.	No
2714	Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.	No
25713	60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	Yes
11649	But I don't think this is an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in place to try to separate the parties for that reason, Jim.	No
1305	And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	No
8218	I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	No
3508	And I promise you that that will happen.	No
18064	The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	Yes
10053	We read their accounts about what happened.	No
29279	And, Hillary, I'm just asking you that.	No
16185	I'm not going to go there and try to throw the Massachusetts mud off the beaches of New Jersey.	No
21686	I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	No
22217	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	No
20771	Let me give you an example.	No
9359	You'll get your chance in a minute.	No
3191	These are foreign policy initiatives that are of the highest moral quality and attest to that country's foreign policy.	No
2661	It's not because I didn't have a commitment to education.	No
26113	Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	Yes
30194	I also have a better temperament than her, you know?	No
3297	And we treated him responsibly, and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	No
21737	On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	No
434	The question is who makes the decision.	No
16700	I think I know the capabilities and limits of atomic energy.	No
31891	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	No
2099	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	Yes
8670	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	Yes
6110	If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.	No
26723	One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	No
20007	Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	Yes
18203	You know, we must be 100 percent right.	No
24332	There's no question about that.	No
12553	It can and will grow even more in the next four.	No
20896	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we're asking you to post the results on the Internet.	No
16167	90 percent reduction in leadership since I chaired this regulatory working group; 90 percent.	Yes
17626	And, no, I have never proposed $20 billion in drugs; I have proposed that the program that we have to deal with this particular problem.	Yes
23852	I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	No
23186	Right, thank you for that.	No
3465	But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	No
10143	We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	Yes
13417	The farmer who cultivates wheat receives about two and a half cents on a twenty-five cents bread.	Yes
969	It is one that we are going to solve and that we must solve, with a clean and healthy environment and with a strong America that is strong militarily and economically as we should be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we are faithful to our values.	No
23230	They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	No
3100	But I can say this: the number one responsibility of any president, above all, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free from the threat of attack, or blackmail, and to fulfil our obligations towards our allies and friends, and to pursue a legitimate foreign policy.	No
953	And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	No
5548	Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.	No
2155	So, if you're 60 or older, you don't need to listen further.	No
16753	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	Yes
24589	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to tell Ross Perot, please don't tell DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	No
19100	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	Yes
14486	The debt and the deficit.	No
6942	But let me say to America: I am not proposing a government-led program.	No
25093	We must be strong, we must be ready to use that force, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	No
4170	And I guarantee you he wouldn't say that high presidential level.	No
6048	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	Yes
21227	I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	No
20771	Let me give you one example.	No
14160	I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.	No
14867	I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	Yes
16805	It's a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered by the fact that our country naturally got an unemployment rate of 6 percent, that is, an unemployment rate of 7 percent and an inflation rate of 6 percent.	Yes
17217	We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.	No
24367	Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.	Yes
6150	Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	Yes
19893	You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	No
10094	It took them a long time to say that it was a terrorist act committed by a terrorist group.	No
19436	And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	No
22220	I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.	No
26787	We must disagree on ideas, honestly, and talk about the future.	No
3559	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	Yes
16302	Who's been managing this system?	No
23762	I am optimistic, but we must make the right choices, be financially responsible and create new jobs for the future.	No
24438	The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	No
17192	And I think that tonight, as we contrast for the first time with our different approach to government, values, leadership in this country, I think that as this debate moves forward, the American people will have for the first time the chance to weigh us against each other.	No
11071	We could provide logistical support, create a no-fly zone at a relatively low cost to us, but we can only do so if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	No
4307	But after September 11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and it was a commission to investigate September 11, to find out what happened and to fix it.	Yes
19970	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	No
4268	That's not true, John.	No
13504	We must persuade these other countries not to restrict the entry of our goods, not to act as if there were a gap of dollars; and thirdly, we must persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities we have so far maintained, to help the underdeveloped countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia to make an economic breakthrough themselves.	No
29868	And I'm gonna tell you, you look at the city center -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you saw me, I've been everywhere.	No
9018	And I freely said throughout this country that it was a mistake for me or for anyone to try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, as important as it is, and important that my religious faith be for me - it is a very personal question.	Yes
23315	We have $40 billion for Bermuda.	Yes
13017	Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	No
18448	And I believe that a new start, a new credibility, a president who can understand what we need to do to reach out to the Muslim world so that it is clear that it is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq to go to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	No
22369	I hope a lot of --	No
27366	It is not motivated by politics.	Yes
3922	He did not say that.	No
1144	He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	No
24563	See, our differences are our strengths.	No
32025	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	Yes
17482	The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.	No
28665	I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	No
29925	He should have produced it a long time before.	No
19962	In the end, I think the American people, thought he would recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	No
542	But that's the point he misses.	No
21366	If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	No
24505	And he went out and he did.	No
23881	We can do much, much better, but we should not try to convince the American people that America is a country that separates itself by sewing.	No
29687	Race remains an important challenge in our country.	No
13963	You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	Yes
19991	I mean, I don't like dealing with personal affairs.	No
15729	We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	No
312	I don't think there's any question about it, and I don't want it.	No
2334	That's why I'll have a settlement.	No
8111	I think it will depend to a large extent on what we are doing here in the United States, the kind of society we are building, the kind of force we are maintaining.	No
14174	I think -- I think I made a mistake.	No
15413	First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	No
27604	And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	No
19634	When he gave you the biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your health care system.	Yes
18805	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to react faster.	No
14100	Now give me 1 second...	No
21191	You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	No
27960	but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	No
3480	So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.	No
10564	And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	No
24670	Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	No
20981	I would like my Secretary of the Treasury to be in contact with the financial centres not only here, but at home.	No
13110	This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.	No
25813	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	No
26978	They don't happen to be accurate.	No
11666	But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.	No
23203	Small businesses are starting to grow and jobs are being added.	No
23590	So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	No
26567	And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	No
23414	I have a plan to cover these people.	Yes
26227	We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	Yes
19432	It's an invasion of drugs all over the world.	No
15532	The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	No
26015	Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	No
2535	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	No
1052	And I think it's part of being a human being.	No
239	But we got to have a knowledge base.	No
31898	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	No
15298	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	No
13422	The Vice-President suggested a number of things.	No
21457	In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	Yes
26161	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	No
16241	Because you're so interested in a poll that could have come out, or because someone had said something mean about someone else.	No
33311	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	Yes
26482	I've worked so hard here to help turn this economy around.	No
2294	This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	No
16254	I think a great many of them have come out today.	No
29742	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to move on with the case.	Yes
20064	I have relatives on Medicare.	No
34287	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	No
27339	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	No
25701	And I hope that tonight, when we finish this debate, you will have a better understanding and the audience of viewing and listening will have a better understanding.	No
18675	Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.	Yes
21741	Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.	No
1678	I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	No
15976	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	Yes
2349	It hurts the housing market because Dodd-Frank doesn't plan to put in place the kind of regulations you need to have.	Yes
11400	Peace in the Middle East is in the interest of our nation.	No
18969	And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	No
7091	The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	No
23861	I think the Americans deserve better than they deserve.	No
14084	We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	Yes
27060	We have provided humanitarian assistance and helped the opposition to organize itself, and we are particularly interested in ensuring that we mobilize moderate forces within Syria.	Yes
28917	I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	No
32165	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	No
21226	Mine is that I want to empower people in their own lives.	No
2341	You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	No
9583	And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	No
3116	Most recently, President Rabin said that our relationship was never better.	Yes
24344	But we are so, turned inward that we do not understand the global image.	No
14760	Rather simply, who is the best qualified person here on the stage to create jobs?	No
26917	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	No
7232	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	No
2328	But in the past, Governor Romney said he just wanted to abrogate Dodd- Frank, get him back.	Yes
19795	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	No
22047	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	No
21969	I'll tell you how it's affected me.	No
25574	But the hard reality is that we need to know what we are doing and pursue the goals that are possible in our time.	No
28982	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	No
12633	On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	Yes
14089	And we've got big problems with that.	No
25497	And I am not at all convinced that he was so out of line with his people or that they wanted this to happen.	No
24156	We have given entire industries.	Yes
17425	And so, my change had come earlier than that.	No
25125	There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	No
25820	It's about where we are now.	No
23222	Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
26059	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	No
6636	Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	Yes
1785	And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	No
1518	We are not at war.	No
12512	Since the beginning of this campaign, I have had a very rare privilege.	No
3909	It's a time when Bin Laden was still outside, and now they're back together.	No
764	And I've said mistakes were made.	No
2612	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	Yes
2422	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	Yes
17815	This economy is starting to run downhill.	No
6967	But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	No
25877	We used to have 18.	Yes
25418	Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.	No
2530	There are alternatives to achieving the objective I have, i.e. reducing rates, broadening the base, simplifying the code and creating incentives for growth.	No
19959	I just finished reading a book, I think that's what we call -- what we call, what it is, the disappearance of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something that talks about all the liberal influences in the administration.	No
3601	And I pay for every penny.	No
19857	But if you have a private purchase voucher plan, it should be determined by the states in the localities where they collect and spend most of the money.	No
18575	Even the administration admitted not to have done the training, because they returned to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	Yes
27705	And what we have also done is engage these governments in the kind of reforms that will really make a difference in the lives of people on a day-to-day basis, to ensure that their governments are not corrupt, to ensure that they treat women with the kind of respect and dignity that each successful nation has shown and to ensure that they have a functioning free market system.	Yes
14184	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time that I was going to take a lot of political flakes.	No
15147	But by taking this no from the Soviet Union, we then resumed negotiations on their terms, because Mr Carter had cancelled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the submarine Trident, delayed the cruise missile, closed the Man missile - the three - the minuteman missile production line, and all other things that could have been done.	Yes
18941	Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
1213	For example, we proposed approximately $12 million to add between four and five hundred additional staff for the National Parks Service.	Yes
16153	We should have rural business areas.	No
2596	It's time for a new road.	No
3766	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	No
13188	What I mean is that once you do this - follow this course of action - indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to hurry to the point of not coming back.	No
23145	The federal government is going to run it.	No
12816	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	No
2573	Each school district, each State should take this decision on its own.	No
24963	I've never thought of such a thing.	No
18137	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are there are not armored.	Yes
7665	I do it because it is the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	No
10018	And they are not just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	No
33883	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	No
19387	I therefore believe that the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a constant record in favour of the reform of campaign financing, and I will continue to have it.	Yes
1315	I'm strongly against abortion.	No
15253	We cannot set aside these regulations.	No
9625	But number two, because I recognized that if you want to have women in the workforce, sometimes you have to be more flexible.	No
20110	Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.	Yes
1999	But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.	No
14178	We've capped the growth of all this spending, and it's good and it's helped.	No
16180	I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	No
16736	So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	No
20125	In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	Yes
15030	We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	No
20470	We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	No
8783	I spoke to one of the leading former chiefs of naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me that 25,000 chiefs of staff were in short supply.	Yes
34142	They say, what do we need this for?	No
22026	Then, out of this debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	No
23962	Middle-class people, defined as people with an income of $52,000 or less, saw their income decline while their taxes increased in the Reagan-Bush years as a result of 6 wage tax increases.	Yes
7984	It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.	No
16705	I think the Wall Street Journal recently reported that they have one hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people their own existence.	Yes
3095	Well, let me say very quickly that under the Johnson presidency, despite the massive investments in the Vietnam war, he gave Mr. Nixon a balanced budget.	Yes
1042	I think the Americans are, too.	No
7259	That is one of the main differences we have in the defence of our country.	No
9924	No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.	No
22193	We need to innovate through this America 2000 program.	No
27783	And so we must understand that we cannot simply surrender and lose jobs year after year.	No
27789	And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	No
20113	And so I think that when you look at these results, you know that the plan I've made for the future has a very good chance of being adopted if you give me a chance to build this bridge in the 21st century.	No
3081	Such a strong economy is very important.	No
6673	"They were told, ""Don't even worry about it; we won't listen to it."""	No
18301	The president and I have always agreed on that.	No
28967	You have been promised that health insurance will be reformed, and that social security will be reformed.	Yes
30431	And I don't deserve that.	No
965	I am the product of this and I want to help achieve this dream for every citizen of this country, with good work and good wages, with good schools in all regions of this country and in all communities of this country.	No
27530	I will therefore let the American people decide, judge, which will be more effective and credible when it comes to imposing paralysing sanctions.	No
30197	I have a winning temperament.	No
272	But I salute him for his passion.	No
29313	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	Yes
5550	And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes.	Yes
33016	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	No
6832	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	No
25198	But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	Yes
3500	President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.	No
25683	I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	No
8086	They do stand for something.	No
8261	And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	Yes
11891	There is nothing more harmful than not educating a child.	No
12782	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	No
31939	We saw him embarrass women on TV and Twitter.	Yes
20798	Let's take the marriage penalty, for example.	No
27969	I want to see peace.	No
6716	We have more people who qualify.	Yes
19218	It's not if we're better, it's if they're better.	No
29104	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	No
16087	I think I took care of it.	No
19094	Four years ago you took me on faith.	No
29204	Now, in fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, are you okay?	No
1578	In fact, the year before my departure, we paid Georgia's taxpayers $50 million back.	Yes
5956	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these government agencies?	No
29172	We just have a different vision than what's best for economic growth, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and higher incomes.	No
15145	The SALT II Treaty is the outcome of the negotiations that Mr Carter's team initiated after asking the Soviet Union to discuss the effective reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.	Yes
15372	But the president I quoted made a promise, a democratic promise, and I quoted it because it was never kept.	No
32423	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	No
3591	Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.	Yes
120	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	No
18198	We have 1,000 patrols on the southern border; we want 1,000 on the northern border.	Yes
25870	I also presented to Congress and they have adopted a vast package of improvements in quality of life, which are very important.	Yes
22720	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	No
19933	The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	Yes
11812	But I have to admit that this was the first time I really focused on her in a new way.	No
6505	That's kind of one of those exaggerations.	No
3554	This one's a little old.	No
20070	That's what this race is all about.	No
1458	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	Yes
27310	They're still number one today.	Yes
11247	That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.	Yes
19348	Let's be honest about it.	No
3666	And it's just a fact.	Yes
17882	I would like to thank the Women's Voters League and the City of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	No
899	I mean, there's... I don't think that's a fair argument.	No
15210	It's a major war explosion in a warhead.	No
298	They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	No
2861	May I make a comment - part of the question you asked, Mr Trewhitt?	No
26485	And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	Yes
13834	Our government is at this point now.	No
15307	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	No
22080	Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	No
17478	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	Yes
33270	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	No
34259	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	Yes
24906	A president must not only make sure that we are hard, but also be wise and intelligent in the exercise of that power.	No
1445	It means that there will be increased hires.	No
17204	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	No
29219	How do you report -- specifically bringing jobs, from American manufacturers?	No
23514	But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	No
315	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	No
7085	If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	No
10757	That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.	No
18234	I think they want to.	No
5617	And some of the discounts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year in insurance company subsidies.	Yes
15925	But I think that this, that the next President, even in a relatively stable budget and that is what we will have for the foreseeable future, will have to make these difficult choices which I was talking about and which Mr Bush does not seem to want to do.	No
24670	Now, all those guys with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running in the congress halls that do politics now -- lobbyists, PAC guys, foreign lobbyists, and what-you, they're gonna be there in the Smithsonian, you know...	No
6742	I am deeply concerned that judges make these decisions and not by the citizens of the United States.	No
13494	Now on the question of gold.	No
23976	We lost 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	Yes
30035	It's -- it's a huge problem.	No
6333	By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	Yes
18571	But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	No
18437	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	No
7068	It's a subject I know very well.	No
27210	We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	No
11447	But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	No
14051	And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	No
24455	Seventy-two other nations were able to do so.	Yes
7876	Less than two hundred for all African countries and they need trained leadership more than anything else.	Yes
18276	I think it's worthy for a follow-up.	No
24858	We need to increase our exports, and they are going very, very well, indeed.	No
13106	I will say this: in the event that such an attack would have occurred and in the event that the attack would have been a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be an indication today because the Chinese Communists repeatedly say that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they only consider them as springboards to take Formosa - in the event that their attack was then a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there is no question, but that the United States would then, as in the case of Berlin, honour our treaty obligations and remain our ally of Formosa.	Yes
2172	That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.	Yes
2499	Now it also means you have more customers.	No
12845	He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	No
32104	You didn't erase them?	No
2141	She had worked her whole life, put in that money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	No
3499	You mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	No
26089	We have an excellent economic package that I hope we will discuss later.	No
22082	I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	No
19805	But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	No
29317	And I was Secretary of State...	No
16253	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	No
18631	There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein hoped that the world would close its eyes.	No
19160	Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	No
22188	And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	Yes
25368	But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	No
17030	In the first century of our nation's history, our ancestors gave us the best form of government in the history of humanity.	No
4246	That made no sense whatsoever.	No
3085	And that would allow us to deal with developing nations in a position of strength.	No
29930	And I feel like they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	No
18928	It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	No
26354	We had a family break in our office, I'm sure.	No
20026	I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	No
3437	And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	No
5568	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	Yes
7691	There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	Yes
19574	It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	No
10475	As President of the United States, Alan, I would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to immediately purchase bad home mortgages in America and renegotiate the new value of these homes -- to the diminished value of these houses and allow people to make them -- to be able to make these payments and stay in their homes.	No
16852	What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	No
4032	No American soldier dies in vain because he carries out the missions of his commander-in-chief.	No
13706	Admit it, which Arkansas does very, very badly against any norm - the environment, support to the police, anything.	Yes
15799	I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	No
24902	To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	No
28791	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better for her in Texas.	No
32448	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
20023	Let me say what I have already said about this question of forgiveness.	No
17310	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	No
25632	We don't know anything about them.	No
18455	My opponent just said something amazing.	No
18480	There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.	No
34128	But you know who will be the great winner in Mosul after we finally get it?	No
13602	On this point, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference with the current administration.	Yes
20960	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	No
19587	We must be able to make a difference.	No
19416	I think we all do.	No
32023	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	No
173	It is time for a chief executive who can make difficult choices, can work with Congress, can reduce this deficit and start building a solid budget base under this country.	No
24567	We must unite and come together, and there is nothing we cannot do.	No
6248	He's health for the mother.	No
9797	The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million unemployed Americans.	Yes
13451	And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.	Yes
30387	Whether it's the Iranian deal you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion, whether it's the Iranian deal, whether it's something you can -- name -- you can hardly name a good deal.	Yes
7123	We could speed up.	No
14021	I just want to do... foreign lobbyists, all this.	No
4133	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	Yes
24607	We're funding them at â ââ€šâ¬¬¬¬¬ Å′ I wish there was more money -- but we're financing them much more than ever in the past, and we're going to continue to do so.	Yes
14934	We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	No
12240	We must be bold.	No
7811	We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	No
10915	And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	No
31978	I'm not proud of it.	No
507	And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	No
7739	Now, of course, it's just a factor, but it's important.	No
34416	Your husband disagrees with you.	No
25399	And this is the tragic history of the arms race.	No
928	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	No
2826	We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	No
749	We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	No
33040	They'll pay our national debt.	No
29742	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	Yes
9703	President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	Yes
8920	His own companion, while a presidential candidate, said they would cost 30% of inflation in two years, and he quoted his leading economic advisor, a distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of this information.	Yes
23678	And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	No
16484	And it seems to me with the stimulus of more money in the hands of taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of companies to develop, to modernise, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we will have more income and we will have a more prosperous economy.	No
25043	He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.	Yes
2612	You know, that's where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	Yes
12583	Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security a problem in this campaign.	No
259	Well, I don't question his passion.	No
21259	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	No
22955	This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	No
18326	"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	Yes
25496	Morton, I criticized the President because of our undercutting of what was a cunning ally - the Shah of Iran.	No
17369	The president said it would disappear automatically.	No
29645	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	No
13925	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
6239	And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	No
19158	I guess I'm counting more on the individual.	No
9088	These are some of the major issues - the atomic war, the use of our natural resources and the question of nationalism - that I intend to talk about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I hope that the American people will listen and see that an independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey will be able to give us the kind of coalition government we need in 1980 to start solving our problems.	No
26842	This is a real important election.	No
20869	We had a great time.	No
10129	Because frankly, in my hometown of Chicago, there's a lot of violence and they don't use the AK-47s.	No
11032	But the challenge is to know when the United States of America can take advantage of the outcome of a crisis, when to go and when not, when the American military power is worth the expense of our most precious treasure.	No
2223	But people make their own choices.	No
33939	So, I'd like to ask you now, why not return the money you've taken in some countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	No
24619	"What I know is that one of these ACT UP groups says, ""Bush should change his behavior."""	No
2172	It's $1 -- it's $1 for every $15 you cut.	Yes
15170	There were preliminary skirmishes in Senate committees, but the treaty never came to the Senate for a debate or vote.	Yes
9645	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was questioned about Bill Lilly Ledbetter, if he supported it?	No
8762	Mr Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight does not take into account another very important fact.	No
23367	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	Yes
2483	To reduce the cost of health care, we do not need a board of 15 people to tell us what types of treatments we should have.	No
13811	And all you hear about is how bad things are.	No
26357	I work with people every day.	No
22653	I would have brought our allies to our side.	No
11903	Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	No
17656	But again, we found people who, under the previous administration, families with no income limits were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	Yes
12610	We turn to Europe, to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	No
17777	"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"	No
20784	And if you add the numbers, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money for a tax reduction for the richest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, health care, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
33655	...it's abroad back in the country.	No
25509	And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?	Yes
15557	More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.	Yes
21488	I end up because I feel strongly...	No
470	Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	No
14173	I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	No
19926	We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	Yes
8619	If we fail, if we fail to move forward, if we do not develop sufficient military, economic and social strength in this country, then I think the tide could begin to hit us.	No
33324	We need to keep drugs out of our country.	No
19044	The army will be an all-volunteer army.	No
25647	I was just...	No
21860	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	Yes
17678	Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	No
1567	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	No
21794	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	No
5809	And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	No
7654	Of course, this was rejected, as was the provision on State contracts in the special session of Congress at which Mr. Kennedy was very active.	Yes
5769	That, to me, was so hurtful.	No
24194	And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	No
20054	I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.	Yes
18445	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	No
17277	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	No
28694	I think that money after school should be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because someone has heard the call to love a neighbor as you would like to be loved yourself.	No
16497	And from the analysis I have done so far, it seems to me that this tax bill justifies my signature and approval.	No
18748	With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	Yes
24070	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	No
17468	And no one has approached this question.	No
9377	And part of that brings a Canadian oil pipeline, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling off Alaska, drilling off Virginia where people want it.	No
24931	And he wrote this manual.	No
15109	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when choice is total authoritarianism, I must say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder if you are useful to the people.	No
440	No other state program does.	Yes
31867	You say who's making these deals?	No
27740	Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	No
32633	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	No
19011	That's not what the Americans thought they had when they voted.	No
19141	But I worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Act, Bill Brady, the prohibition of assault weapons, the program to put 100,000 policemen on the street.	Yes
33279	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	No
25197	"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	No
25184	Mr President, I would like to go to the fence and try to catch it before it passes, but I will move on to another question.	No
8589	But it doesn't force anyone to have insurance that doesn't want it.	No
26071	It's illegal right now and it's been years for illegal immigrants to get social benefits.	Yes
8125	I am not satisfied when last year the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth in a major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
1843	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	No
16947	I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	No
575	But I don't think it's just the experience that makes the difference.	No
19870	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	No
1940	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	Yes
16888	We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	Yes
10669	My friends, part of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
12154	He declared the need for a further tax reduction for the Texas oil companies an emergency need, and therefore the money was withdrawn from the CHIP program.	Yes
23519	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	No
12546	It's not enough to keep this file because we're dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical leaders that the world has ever seen.	No
16136	There are many things we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest entrepreneurs have filled their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	No
11883	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	No
24002	So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	No
22742	Now everyone knows there were no weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
683	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle don't.	No
25719	We should grant a tax reduction for the education and education of children, the purchase of a first home and the payment of health care.	No
18746	If they were not ready to conclude an agreement, then we could have put sanctions together.	No
24339	the question, to get a new army, get the best of the world, we have it, and they keep peace, and they are respected all over the world.	No
21110	If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	No
3558	Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	No
3116	Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	Yes
14745	This Thursday evening on ABC from 8:30 am to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8:30 am to 8:30 am, and Saturday night on CBS from 8:30 am to 8:30 am, we will be in the trenches under the hood working on fixing the old car to bring it back on the road.	No
25407	Why not stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	No
209	That is how we will ensure basic health security for all citizens of our country.	No
29165	Of course, we are 5 per cent of the world's population; we have to trade with the others 95 per cent.	No
1115	And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.	No
16859	Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	Yes
24500	Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts.	Yes
17743	You want to make suggestions?	No
23947	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	No
315	They taught me it was the largest country in the world.	No
11280	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	No
6020	Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	Yes
3208	And I believe that we used our skill.	No
33376	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or so.	Yes
34367	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	No
12454	I think we need to place more emphasis on early learning and pre-schooling.	No
17581	And I think most of our employees -- that's why we had a 25% tax reduction that kept the same progressivity of our tax structure in parentheses.	Yes
11288	The tensions will be ratcheted up.	No
22	And, of course, with regard to how we improve it, yes, we can do better with regard to prohibition.	No
15867	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	No
19284	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I turned on the floor, I had a phone call from a trial lawyer saying that I think we have a case here.	No
24043	The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	Yes
352	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	No
28262	I strongly believe in local control of schools.	No
21209	One of the serious problems, listen to me, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence from special interest money.	No
26642	We took it out of politics.	No
6176	I voted for Judge Breyer and Judge Ginsburg.	Yes
28121	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	No
25811	That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	Yes
3379	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	No
4042	And when I'm president, I will.	No
10759	I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help get help, and those of us, like me and Senator McCain, who don't need help, don't get that help.	No
3765	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	Yes
8039	It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	No
12548	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	Yes
17348	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	No
1535	We had inflation of more than 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in Vietnam's problems.	Yes
22331	Look at all those candidates in the Senate we have here.	No
17602	All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	Yes
20136	We left better than four years ago.	No
20563	I want the spectators to listen to what I have to say about it.	No
20849	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	No
17354	And if it doesn't go down, the economy will slow down, maybe fall into recession.	No
25263	The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	Yes
22783	Sometimes they don't like America's decisions, but I don't think you want a president trying to become popular and doing the wrong thing.	No
22221	But I am in favour of the choice of public schools, and I am in favour of radical decentralization by giving more power to better trained directors and teachers with parental councils to control their schools.	No
11997	I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	No
12261	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	No
11355	My mother basically raised our family.	No
8721	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous time in this country in terms of energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	No
26259	I've never supported quotas.	Yes
20793	We must make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers as well as the professionals they are.	No
8723	But what is called secondary or tertiary efforts to get him out of the ground would be necessary.	No
25428	Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	No
15022	Under the exceptional profit tax, we plan to spend approximately $43 billion over the next 10 years to rebuild our country's transportation systems.	Yes
13363	Secondly, I believe that this administration's policy of high interest rates has added about $3 billion a year to interest on debt - debt financing - which is a burden for taxpayers.	Yes
3479	And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	No
18311	They left the planning of the State Department in the offices of the State Department.	No
1555	"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	No
34431	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	No
17861	In 1980, the same person was $500 below the poverty line.	Yes
1097	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	No
16377	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	Yes
20053	I address him all night as Mr. President.	No
7781	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	Yes
24570	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	No
4320	But that doesn't mean we don't have a long way to go.	No
12699	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy suggested, there would be results that I know he would not want, and certainly the American people would not want.	No
29939	But, remember, Donald started his career in 1973 by being sued by the Department of Justice for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his African-American developments, and he made sure the people who worked for him understood that it was politics.	Yes
20474	We don't have to do that.	No
7519	In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	No
29207	It's very important to me.	No
12065	And we can enforce law.	No
21629	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	Yes
20936	Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	No
15193	Moreover, the contradictory relationship between us and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very quickly.	No
1555	"It would be the greatest honour for me to have your support on November 2nd and to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep doing it."""	No
25927	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	No
13639	We have to pay him back.	No
5797	But this requires, I think, recognition that politics as usual, as it has been practiced in recent years, does not solve the major problems here in America.	No
20333	It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	No
24679	-- because if the American people send me there, we will.	No
8375	And so I never suggested that we be able to withdraw the debt substantially, or at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	Yes
17818	Growth is a little over 3 percent now.	Yes
19915	I want people in my administration and I'll have people in my administration who understand America.	No
9599	That's not what you did in that generation.	No
11345	Senator Obama had the opening.	No
21174	They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	No
30363	I said she didn't have endurance.	Yes
3479	And I think there's a constructive job going on there.	No
23890	I have no experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent society in the industrialized world.	No
23504	It's in our country, the United States of America.	No
565	But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.	No
7613	In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	No
2802	In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	No
19193	Maybe some of them are better off.	No
32520	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	Yes
22463	In other words, unless we do, choose someone who likes to talk about it.	No
29279	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	No
16622	I did so with substantial reductions in the number of employees in some departments.	Yes
25294	We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.	No
14396	We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	Yes
23473	Most small businesses -- 70% of new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	Yes
29848	But it is important that we learn what has been effective.	No
19245	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	No
22389	I can think of a lot.	No
20092	But I wanted the Americans to know that I was willing to give up something.	No
21214	I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	No
20231	His plan is three times as big as President Clinton's plan eight years ago.	Yes
4110	And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	No
28640	I like policies that will encourage farmers to set aside land for conservation purposes as well.	No
13197	And in this case, good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	No
11092	And I may have to make those tough decisions.	No
29694	At the moment, this is not the case in many of our neighbourhoods.	No
10909	I vote against them, my friends.	No
3105	He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
10554	And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.	Yes
19143	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	No
25235	You must be tough and smart.	No
7511	And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	No
29514	But that's the kind of thought our country needs.	No
24058	And I simply do not believe that we can afford and that we do not need to keep 150,000 soldiers in Europe, given that the Red Army, now under Russia's control, has been cut off, the arms control agreement between Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin, which I applauded.	Yes
10310	Candy, there are jobs that won't come back.	No
18992	I can't say it any more plainly.	No
25509	And what I have to say about this is, on many occasions - and this has to do with the Philippines, too, I know that there are things in the Philippines that we do not think are right from the point of view of democratic rights at the moment, but what is the alternative?	Yes
11838	And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	Yes
1302	And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	No
32926	I'm shocked to hear that.	No
15748	How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?	No
17558	This meant that he paid less taxes than the janitor who cleaned his office or the driver who drove him to work.	Yes
27723	But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	No
10801	And we offer a 50 percent tax credit so they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are a lot of small businesses I meet all over America that want to do well by their workers, but they just can't afford it.	Yes
29944	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	No
17286	The whole story tells us it's a mistake.	No
3033	In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	Yes
8352	As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	No
11238	Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	No
1758	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	No
20882	The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	Yes
3336	Let me restate uh - our policy.	No
16482	And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	Yes
18499	Her husband PJ got killed.	No
12559	Again we turn to the past.	No
7090	Let me quickly answer part of the last question, and then I will come to immigration.	No
27062	And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	Yes
33462	She won't even talk about words, nor will President Obama.	No
15528	And so I'm proud of my choice.	No
28270	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, it is normal in America just to mix poor children through schools, there must be a consequence.	No
15521	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defence; he helped modify the INF treaty, so we got a good treaty, when these people here were talking about a freeze.	Yes
10830	"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	No
22036	You see, we have a debt of 4 trillion dollars and only in America, you would have 2.8 trillion dollars or 70% of them financed 5 years or less.	Yes
23144	You know what that is?	No
22792	We didn't have enough strength.	No
587	I have little experience and now how to handle this, but please don't come back to the time when the military were as weak as they could, when morale was falling, and when we were laughing around the world.	No
28464	Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	No
21810	So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	No
14198	This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	No
4209	He did not understand that Russia had committed serious aggression against Georgia.	Yes
7795	And here, in a country that, if it moves forward, if it develops its economy to the maximum - which we are not now - in my opinion, we will have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments abroad.	No
6487	I think this attitude and view is dangerous.	No
8872	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	Yes
24325	They don't go to war against each other.	No
24414	That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	No
1280	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	Yes
33661	...the fact is that he's going to plead for the biggest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times as much as the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	Yes
2013	That doesn't get the job done.	No
22694	These are the words of two respected Republicans, both in the Committee on External Relations.	No
15018	This effort has been very successful.	No
10888	We will have to find alternatives, which means that the US government is working with the private sector to finance the type of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and set up a coal-fired power plant a week.	Yes
28837	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	No
25062	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	Yes
32284	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	Yes
22957	The when I can't tell you.	No
10631	And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	No
6979	You have just heard the President say that young people should be able to withdraw money from social security and put it in their own accounts.	Yes
23709	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	Yes
948	I want us to finalize this START agreement and I want it to be the one that finally leads the world to ban chemical and biological weapons.	No
10381	Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	No
12856	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	No
32186	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	No
421	No, I don't think so.	No
11082	This requires a cold hand at the slab.	No
16021	George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.	Yes
22310	Including parents in their children's preschool education, even if they are poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	No
24275	You were gonna go fast.	No
19587	We have to be able to make a difference.	No
33954	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	Yes
22129	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	No
26018	It's a political year, and the president plays politics with Medicare.	No
17234	We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	No
16380	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimistic, and so is the American people.	No
13335	We cannot afford massive economic cuts when we are in the terrible competition we have with the Soviets.	No
8733	possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	Yes
20439	I commend you for supporting that.	No
22727	Risk your troops in a war you called an error.	No
33622	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	No
15537	And that's why people are so concerned.	No
33044	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	Yes
34364	Yeah, we've heard that before, Hillary.	No
6039	If we can get that right, then we can go in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs across America, including in the heart where we can reuse some of these plants to make these fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the types of clean energy approaches that should be driving our economy for the next century.	No
392	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	No
1175	I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	No
33949	I'm very proud of that.	No
2830	You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.	No
20033	But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	No
32135	And it hasn't been finished at all.	No
9328	There were a whole bunch of oil companies.	No
7016	Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.	No
20160	And that's what you're facing, the parents are facing, and the grandparents are facing.	No
15518	He founded the author, the Vocational Training Partnership Act.	Yes
26922	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and that represents a huge threat to our friends, to the world, to America, in the long term, and we need to have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this type of extremism.	Yes
17360	They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.	No
6137	Senator Obama wants the government to do the job.	No
23823	That is how the authors of the Constitution wanted our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	No
33606	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	No
14950	I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.	No
17751	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	No
28843	You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	No
24774	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be happy to go up there and we'll do it.	No
19873	And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	Yes
21849	So I want to keep the quality of health care.	No
6790	"Faith without works is dead. """	No
3055	In fact, during the current year, we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars in arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars in weapons.	Yes
21794	If you put time limits and don't reform the government, you won't have the benefits you thought.	No
18578	We have to start to spend the money now.	No
26390	We're going to do that with an economic package.	No
2913	That kind of thing hurt us a lot.	No
28246	It also means helping local school districts that sometimes find parents of school-age children nicknamed bond issues, to give them some help with the interest-free bail authority so that we can build new schools and upgrade classrooms.	No
7196	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	Yes
23471	I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	No
13135	They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.	Yes
566	And we now know that he was not off-track; he was in a meeting after hearing Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger oppose it, and yet he supported it.	Yes
22130	All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	Yes
13729	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	No
21498	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	Yes
29296	Revenues have increased for everyone.	Yes
16411	Thank you very much.	No
2507	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	No
34335	We must use them to negotiate our trade agreements.	No
8702	50% social security tax payments.	Yes
14915	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
5919	They know she's a role model for women and others -- and reformers all over America.	No
22105	NATO, for example, has been maintaining peace for many years, and I want us to remain fully staffed within NATO so that we can continue to guarantee peace in Europe.	No
25762	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	No
24187	The second, you have your big companies that have problems, including the defence industries, have another one on it.	No
11447	But I think we must also have a sense of mission in the world.	No
20707	I think this is an important element of leadership.	No
6206	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	Yes
25836	But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	No
22115	Yes, we have problems at home.	No
32338	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	No
19636	This is a serious business.	No
13296	I would disagree with it.	No
2944	Let me cite a number of examples.	No
23317	We ought to be shutting those down.	No
16994	For a long time, our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes lied.	No
28135	We want them to continue.	No
9797	The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.	Yes
23860	I've touched the lives of more people and seen more grief and hope, more pain and more promises than anyone else who comes to the presidency this year.	No
19338	Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	Yes
8699	While I suggested we should take it.	No
15755	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	No
10718	And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	No
16463	He would have asked for export controls on agricultural products In my opinion, the best way to get jobs is to expand the private sector, where there are now five out of six jobs in our economy.	Yes
1086	But to add another feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	Yes
3873	I was honored to speak to these troops.	No
23053	John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.	No
14383	They investigated every single one of my children.	Yes
10635	And you know what you're gonna find?	No
26754	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	No
3357	Will it be a nightmare world threatened by the proliferation of atomic bombs, not only in five large countries, but also in dozens of small countries that have been allowed to develop atomic weapons because of the inability of our leaders to stop proliferation?	Yes
21342	Let me mention three things very quickly.	No
25435	I don't know what it would be, but if we can find one, I think the world will be better.	No
15072	In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	Yes
8920	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	Yes
22319	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	No
740	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	No
2062	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	No
11827	But I think we need to find out where racial profiling is going and do something about it and tell local people, do the right thing.	No
21029	They were lucky enough to cut your tax.	No
21588	I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	No
26958	Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	Yes
9046	If the wind, water or fire destroyed them, we rebuilt them.	No
27093	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	No
15660	And what I had to do was define, not only my position, but to define his position and I hope I did it fairly.	No
8169	And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	No
3175	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	No
23199	And besides, we cut taxes for everyone.	Yes
24022	We simply cannot withdraw.	No
26225	But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	No
14106	In the second debate, I proposed, since both sides want the business areas and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off to go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll do it.	Yes
20303	The governor described Medicare as a government HMO.	Yes
6230	There was a bill introduced in the Illinois Senate that said that you had to provide vital care and that would have contributed to undermining Roe v. Wade.	Yes
27377	We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	Yes
24735	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	Yes
2949	We have achieved five and three quarters of sales of a minimum of six million metric tonnes, which means that they have already purchased about four million metric tonnes this year and are required to purchase another two million metric tonnes to take the grain and corn and wheat produced by American farmers to have full production.	Yes
13485	But now we see that the countries of Europe, for example, that we have helped, and Japan, that we have helped in the Far East; these countries - some of our former enemies - have now completely recovered.	Yes
7864	He thinks that we are moving forward, uh - in one - we are not going into a recession in this country, economically; he thinks that our power and prestige is stronger than ever compared to that of the communists, than we are moving forward.	No
33399	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	Yes
8459	It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	Yes
22964	You must have the best intelligence in the world.	No
12258	I think we should have federal liability protection, depending on whether the standards have been met or not.	No
3908	There's no one who can threaten us there.	No
32286	We just lost something well-known with Muhammad Ali.	No
10171	What we have right now in Washington is a place that's blocked.	No
14057	If the laws are so violated, but to suggest if someone represents a foreign country on something, that makes it corrupt or against the taxpayer, I do not agree with that.	No
3577	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	Yes
28902	During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.	No
12544	And so I say that the file shows that we know how to keep peace, to keep it without surrendering.	No
1853	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you get business income.	No
19850	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	No
17252	And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	No
12090	And that's what has to happen.	No
24841	The Soviet Union is no longer and we are working with a democratic country.	Yes
16384	And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.	No
729	We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	No
24461	Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	No
10759	I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.	No
28401	Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	No
32877	And he supports me 100%.	Yes
21178	We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.	No
16800	And we have the greatest unemployment we have had under Mr Ford's administration since the Great Depression.	Yes
19340	Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.	Yes
16261	I am concerned about what that does to our future.	No
13673	The answer is to invest and develop this economy.	No
17322	And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	Yes
447	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	No
2885	Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	No
17322	And that would mean a religious test for the first time in American life.	Yes
24320	Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.	Yes
25689	Sometimes the views have been distorted.	No
19104	We've passed 100,000 policemen, the prohibition of assault weapons, Bill Brady.	Yes
28462	At the moment, our army is the strongest in all the history of the world.	Yes
8433	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assume more of this responsibility.	No
27681	It's important for the success of Afghanistan.	No
5494	And they want this country to move in a new direction.	No
15176	First of all, the Soviet Union, if I have criticized some of the previous agreements, it is because we have been off the table for quite some time.	No
21887	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	No
19844	90 percent of our children are in these public schools and we need to raise their standards and move them forward with programs like those I described in this campaign.	Yes
16556	I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	No
10267	Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.	Yes
24657	I'm proud of what we've done to the Democratic Convention, putting two HIV-positive people on the platform, and I'm proud of the leadership I'm going to bring to the country to deal with the AIDS crisis.	No
13128	That is the present American position.	No
2752	If I'm elected, we won't have Obama.	No
16228	The American people live up to the debate.	No
34334	We have the greatest businessmen in the world.	No
23951	I was opposed to the war, but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	No
19491	So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	No
16484	And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	No
17763	And give us a plan.	No
4168	I've known him for 35 years.	No
21500	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	No
7922	And because we are going to move in sixty and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength sufficiently in recent years, I believe that before we meet this crisis, the next President of the United States should send a message to Congress calling for the revitalization of our military force, because we will face the most serious crisis in Berlin in the spring or late winter in 149 or 50 years.	No
21821	To do this, you need a system of managed competition where we are all covered by large groups and we can choose our doctors and hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	No
22886	It works especially when we pay our troops well.	No
25440	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	No
2730	Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	No
33600	So we're going to ask the rich to pay their fair share.	No
14342	And speak to any head of these key committees in the Senate.	No
1492	I was in about 30 primary schools in the spring, and at first it was obvious that I had no position in the survey.	No
20638	I'd be kept in my approach.	No
14677	Can't anyone agree with me that the government is breaking business with these trade agreements?	No
9653	Because it's not just a health problem, it's an economic problem for women.	No
14476	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	No
16635	I think the file should show, Mr. Newman, that, uh - the Census Bureau - we checked it yesterday - indicates that, in the four years when Governor Carter was Governor of the State of Georgia, uh - the government's spending increased by more than 50 percent - the government's employees in Georgia during his term of office increased by more than 25 percent; and the figures also show that the government's bonded debt during his term of office increased by more than 20 percent.	Yes
16999	We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	No
14992	"I spoke briefly to a man who asked me a simple question: ""Do I have any reason to hope that I can one day take care of my family?"	No
14234	You have to go see the people.	No
23628	And I really respect him.	No
27831	I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	Yes
19415	Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	Yes
10766	You know, last year until then, we lost 700,000 jobs in America.	Yes
19954	It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	No
8360	Well, I'll just say that the question is about experience and the question too is, uh, what our judgment is of the future, and what are our goals for the United States, and what capacity we have to implement these goals.	No
20310	If you are in a very poor family or have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium and much better benefits you can find in the private sector.	Yes
24109	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	No
19650	The President opposed it in 1993.	Yes
16464	We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	Yes
6068	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	No
16849	I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	No
3577	Senator Obama suspended these requests for pork barrel projects after he was a candidate for the presidency of the United States.	Yes
612	And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	No
1379	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	Yes
12819	There should be no tests in the atmosphere, which excludes any fall.	No
15202	And I think our allies would be very happy to join a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	No
22995	I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	No
9354	There is no doubt that people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	Yes
4238	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	No
25504	And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free trade unions, the free press.	Yes
32817	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	Yes
2507	Is it -- is it because in one way or another middle-class families will benefit too much from them?	No
7418	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	No
19953	Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.	Yes
1425	But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	No
28878	So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	No
26710	This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	No
9468	He's going to help these families, and he's going to create incentives to start creating jobs in this country.	No
19975	I mean, I told people I had traveled, all of you who had the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not a lot of hands go up.	No
28646	I am in favour of a massive reform of property tax or death tax.	No
15398	We are now working on the communications industry.	Yes
21086	That's the difference of opinion.	No
28162	That is a national outrage.	No
26176	This year, the Republican Congress, in terms of student loans, has increased from $24 billion to $36 billion over the next six years.	Yes
5543	That's 16 million jobs in America.	Yes
17717	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	No
4167	In fact, my friend, Dr.Kissiger, who has been my friend for 35 years, would be interested in hearing this conversation and Senator Obama's representation of his -- positions on the issue.	No
16529	And, uh, with this, uh, in this framework would be suitable for any improvement in the programs.	No
16554	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	Yes
21651	The president can't order Congress around.	No
8381	Do not reduce interest -	No
27703	Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	No
20587	It is a very strong incentive that we have given them to do the right thing.	No
27252	Trade grows about 12 percent year.	Yes
26079	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	No
9453	But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	Yes
1382	And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	No
937	But there are two main focal points of this election.	No
746	We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	No
17959	But before I answer, let me thank you for being moderate.	No
472	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	No
18872	And certainty can sometimes cause you trouble.	No
28492	And that means keeping our army strong.	No
25749	They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.	Yes
3126	As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	Yes
9936	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	No
20877	They can't hold another office for her, so she has to stay up during class.	No
7489	And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	No
19687	I certainly didn't think I had to hire American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do it.	No
12833	Now it may seem like a rigid and inflexible position.	No
7627	I believe we should have a stronger military force.	No
11720	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	No
19786	I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	No
29319	And I have done a lot...	No
8192	We have the record Truman administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower administration.	No
32324	We have enough problems in this country.	No
26419	We have negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	Yes
8116	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	No
10721	We're not -- we're not -- we're not gunshots here.	No
3150	I also know that, as far as human beings on this earth are concerned, the non-proliferation of atomic weapons is the first.	No
2460	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	Yes
23578	It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	No
3182	Now, let me correct another comment that Governor Carter made.	No
13865	Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	No
2499	Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	No
19707	Did we inflict any damage?	No
24125	I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.	No
23331	Look at the man's file running for president.	No
15924	This is an example of how often we can be associated with organisations whose particular positions we do not support, even if we generally support the hope that over time, especially if we can achieve these strategic arms reductions, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and reduce the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper reductions on the Soviet side, yes, at some point it might be possible to reduce defence spending and use it for important things here at home, such as jobs and vocational training, educational opportunities, health and housing, the environment and things that we all care about.	No
23225	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	Yes
21932	I love my grandchildren --	No
4246	It didn't make any sense.	No
11118	Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.	No
2744	I'll take my income back.	No
7984	It is not necessary to crush America to build it.	No
17556	In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	Yes
8115	But they are important and dangerous now because they are making a major effort in their own country.	No
18645	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	No
3824	We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	Yes
11171	I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	No
23142	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.	Yes
28147	If you're poor, they pay for everything.	Yes
21151	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	No
24676	And they will make those sacrifices.	No
14912	At the same time, as I said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs over this period - a record never before.	Yes
26259	I have never supported quotas.	Yes
12763	Did Khrushchev win because he took off his shoe and hit the table and shouted and insulted?	No
25590	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	No
1069	But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.	No
6783	Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	No
1370	But that's as far as I would go with it.	No
26604	That's something you could consider.	No
3023	Governor Carter apparently does not realize that since I was president, we have sold over $4 billion in military equipment to Israelis.	Yes
15574	He's broken it three times in the past year already.	Yes
11304	And it is important that we do not grant any veto power to the United Nations or anyone else to act in our interest.	No
13959	And it is free trade, fair trade that must be our trademark, and we need more free trade agreements, no less.	No
27478	But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	No
26771	We should not discriminate -- race, colour, anything -- lifestyle, disability.	No
12821	I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	No
16839	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	No
21148	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	No
23342	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	Yes
7327	It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	No
26052	And I'm here as someone who, a long time ago like the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was to go through all the social assistance checks and sign them.	No
2069	The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	No
1071	Now, like anyone who works hard looking for a public post in the campaign, inevitably you will sometimes use a rather graphic language and I am guilty of that as I think most others in the political arena.	No
20553	It's very clear to me.	No
11808	I think racial profiling is a serious problem.	No
32032	There's never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after you get the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, then you wash them or bleach them with acid, as you would say, very expensive process.	Yes
1163	I don't believe it does.	No
24413	We work through international organizations.	No
18960	That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	No
17977	We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	No
14627	I say, well, it's not as hard as the Second World War and it's not as hard as the revolution.	No
12928	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	Yes
12870	They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	No
28172	And you need to know the record here.	No
290	I do not think they are right to try to withdraw the tax exemption from the Catholic Church.	No
18233	We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.	No
25253	I apologized to Vice-President Bush because I had rather honored these young men, saddened for their families, and thought they were wonderful Americans who honored us all.	No
26960	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	Yes
23000	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	No
34414	So if she removes it, our health insurance problem gets worse.	No
27364	We need to be talking about space.	No
17099	And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.	No
23543	I did it because I also hope that we will discover remedies from stem cells and derived research.	No
33833	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	Yes
15328	Now, we have the opportunity to go to national health insurance, focusing on disease prevention, emphasis on outpatient care, not hospital care; emphasis on limiting hospital costs to reduce hospital costs by far those who are ill, emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so if a family is threatened with economic destruction due to a very high medical bill, then insurance would help pay for it.	No
12397	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	No
34296	We should never have let ISIS arrive.	No
18810	It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	Yes
22161	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	No
188	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	No
23038	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	No
21118	That is what it is.	No
7905	I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	No
8465	He was killed in the Rules Committee.	Yes
25071	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	Yes
7652	Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	No
20745	Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
9195	But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	Yes
13095	But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	No
19272	This is a tax reduction on Main Street, 15 percent from one end to the other -- let's take a family that earns $30,000 a year, or $1,261.	Yes
14387	And the only difference between me and any other businessman who has the range of companies I have is that I haven't had so many lawsuits.	Yes
33381	We either have -- and by the way...	No
20133	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment and invest in education.	No
32289	That is what we want America to be for our children and grandchildren.	No
14183	I should have expected a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and that would not have ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	No
32932	African-American incomes have increased by 33 per cent.	Yes
13752	And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.	No
4077	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	No
1282	The HUD department applies the new law which prohibits, which deals with the redline.	Yes
26821	What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.	No
3536	And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	No
875	I chose it because it was someone who would be a strong vice president, someone who would be an active vice president.	No
24930	We have a gentleman in Nicaragua who is under contract with the CIA, advising - supposedly on military tactics - the contras.	Yes
20695	Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	No
15055	It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.	No
23267	I have a tuition tax credit of $4,000 that goes to parents -- and children, if they earn for themselves -- to be able to pay for the university.	Yes
767	The issue was discussed in detail.	No
15072	In countries such as Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trading partners because we have insisted on controlling the spread of nuclear weapons to these potentially terrorist countries.	Yes
19370	It took three and a half years.	Yes
9177	Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	No
29596	And you should go downstairs and take a look at this.	No
9523	Set our training programs for our workers.	No
2549	But I also believe that the government has the capacity, that the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunities and create scales of opportunity and create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	No
7756	They also cut $2 billion in defence money.	Yes
3182	Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	No
3888	That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	No
22989	We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.	No
23241	But let me talk back about where we've been.	No
10300	That's what brings jobs in.	No
19484	He tried to stop him from coming to my office.	Yes
16232	I've spelled out my position.	No
30227	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	No
9823	How about the growth of the economy?	No
14264	And I just had to work in there.	No
8206	We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.	Yes
8392	I think we're going to have to do it.	No
8570	First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.	No
7973	In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.	Yes
8962	But I know that, despite his commitment to reduce government spending, he went from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967 to $10.2 billion during his eight years of office.	Yes
1066	They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	No
3431	How will this affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to university?	No
18815	We are the largest donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	Yes
27271	But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	Yes
26605	I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	No
29740	He went in front of a judge, who was a judge very opposed to the police.	Yes
19248	I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.	No
21427	WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deal with our problems, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve our problems.	No
12831	Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	No
154	But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	Yes
25563	Now we have to decide between general objectives and reality.	No
8257	Secondly, I think the question is, uh - what are the programs we advocate, what is the file of the party we lead?	No
15516	He had two terms in Congress.	No
8529	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	No
16764	In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	Yes
92	Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	Yes
1601	There are no magic answers to do so.	No
24355	Now that the voices in Congress and across the country have insisted that we do something about China, look what happened.	No
19906	We had millions of young men and women in the subsequent wars that followed that changed the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	No
305	I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.	No
5850	I don't think we'll agree here tonight.	No
12164	And they get health care.	Yes
7274	Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	No
13642	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	No
30330	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	No
5844	But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	No
32762	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	No
9468	It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.	No
15102	And I suggest that Congress conduct such an investigation.	No
