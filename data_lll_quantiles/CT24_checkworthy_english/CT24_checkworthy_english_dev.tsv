3896	Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable. lll	Yes
3975	But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. mmm	No
4202	But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. lll	No
4250	The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy. mmm	No
4275	So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing... mmm	No
4336	The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. mmm	No
4387	That sense is something that I want to restore. sss	No
4390	And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. lll	No
4393	And I know that they know that I'll take care of them. mmm	No
4398	And that's going to be my job. sss	No
4401	I don't think I need any on-the-job training. sss	No
5487	Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you. sss	No
5491	Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry. sss	No
5493	They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry. lll	No
5496	But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes. mmm	No
5498	The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse. lll	Yes
5502	Now, I know the criticism of this. sss	No
5503	Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? mmm	No
5506	And so we've got to reverse this. sss	No
5512	I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. mmm	Yes
5527	And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working. mmm	No
5528	Last point I want to make, though. sss	No
5540	Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. lll	No
5541	And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. mmm	No
5542	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. mmm	Yes
5552	Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. mmm	Yes
5553	What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. mmm	Yes
5559	And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. lll	No
5562	Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. lll	Yes
5565	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around. lll	No
5570	Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now? mmm	No
5571	Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around. lll	No
5577	Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order... lll	No
5582	I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. mmm	No
5583	But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it. lll	No
5587	Well, I don't mind paying a little more. sss	No
5589	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. mmm	Yes
5592	We need to cut the business tax rate in America. mmm	No
5594	Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes. mmm	No
5595	We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around. mmm	No
5608	Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand. lll	Yes
5609	But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments. lll	No
5614	So let me get to that. sss	No
5622	And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut. lll	No
5625	I mentioned health care earlier. sss	No
5630	And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means. lll	No
5635	During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation. mmm	No
5641	But -- OK. All right. sss	No
5643	Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence. mmm	No
5644	We have to have nuclear power. sss	No
5648	OK, what -- what would I cut? sss	No
5654	Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China. lll	Yes
5655	I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. mmm	No
5665	Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects... mmm	Yes
5676	And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work. mmm	No
5683	When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. lll	Yes
5685	And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. mmm	Yes
5692	And let me tell you... sss	No
5699	He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. mmm	Yes
5711	He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed. lll	Yes
5713	So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama. mmm	No
5736	We need to move in a new direction. sss	No
5738	Let me just say, Bob. sss	No
5764	So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. mmm	No
5773	So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. mmm	No
5774	This is a tough campaign. sss	No
5778	"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't. lll"	Yes
5779	And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part. sss	No
5780	Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate. mmm	Yes
5783	Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. mmm	No
5784	I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine. lll	Yes
5788	And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply. lll	No
5815	You've got to read what he said... sss	No
5823	The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. lll	No
5827	We do and I hope... sss	No
5830	But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues. mmm	No
5849	I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns. mmm	No
5860	Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. mmm	No
5863	"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection."" mmm"	Yes
5864	So all of these things need to be examined, of course. mmm	No
5871	Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago. sss	No
5886	Let me tell you who I associate with. sss	No
5894	And the facts are facts and records are records. sss	No
5907	Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. mmm	No
5936	Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too. mmm	No
5941	I agree with that, John. sss	No
5942	I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research. lll	No
5947	I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. mmm	No
5948	But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength. lll	No
5949	He voted against the first Gulf War. sss	Yes
5974	Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe. mmm	No
5975	Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. mmm	Yes
5990	But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem. lll	Yes
5993	We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on. lll	No
5996	But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. lll	No
6000	And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. lll	Yes
6002	We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. mmm	Yes
6004	We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that. lll	No
6006	Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence. mmm	No
6016	Now, on the subject of free trade agreements. sss	No
6019	But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. mmm	No
6022	So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. mmm	Yes
6049	Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. mmm	No
6050	Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. mmm	No
6057	The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. lll	No
6064	We've got to put more money into preventive care. sss	No
6072	And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things. mmm	No
6073	We need to put health care records online. sss	No
6079	The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. mmm	Yes
6080	We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. mmm	No
6087	Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy. lll	No
6107	So here's what we do. sss	No
6120	For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits. mmm	Yes
6121	By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. sss	Yes
6131	The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800. mmm	Yes
6132	I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability. lll	No
6133	This will give them availability. sss	No
6135	This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. mmm	No
6138	I want, Joe, you to do the job. sss	No
6139	I want to leave money in your pocket. sss	No
6141	That's what I'm all about. sss	No
6152	And don't take my word for it. sss	No
6154	All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs. mmm	No
6164	That's not appropriate to do. sss	No
6168	I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. mmm	No
6177	Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. lll	No
6178	This is a very important issue we're talking about. sss	No
6179	Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards. mmm	Yes
6183	And so that's what I will do. sss	No
6187	I would consider anyone in their qualifications. sss	No
6192	And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. lll	No
6194	Now I would not provide a litmus test. sss	No
6196	I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on. lll	No
6213	We have to change the culture of America. sss	No
6214	Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. sss	No
6215	And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision. lll	No
6216	Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. lll	Yes
6219	Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. lll	Yes
6227	Yes, let me respond to this. sss	No
6243	We should try to reduce these circumstances. sss	No
6247	Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. mmm	No
6273	If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. mmm	No
6276	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. sss	No
6287	Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. mmm	No
6289	So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. mmm	No
6291	Look, we must improve education in this country. sss	No
6292	As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. mmm	No
6307	I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools. mmm	No
6328	And we need to fix a lot of the problems. mmm	No
6331	I think the Head Start program is a great program. mmm	No
6338	We need to have transparency. sss	No
6344	And we'll care for these young children. sss	No
6351	I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. mmm	No
6392	And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result. lll	No
6399	In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. mmm	No
6402	And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House. mmm	No
6403	But it's not going to be easy. sss	No
6406	I'm absolutely convinced we can do it. sss	No
6449	Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. mmm	No
6483	Freedom is on the march. sss	No
6542	We're going to make it affordable and accessible. sss	No
6584	I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. mmm	No
6596	When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. mmm	Yes
6658	"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing? mmm"	No
6665	I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. mmm	No
6667	And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. lll	No
6701	I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives. lll	No
6720	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. mmm	Yes
6721	He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. sss	Yes
6729	You know, Bob, I don't know. sss	No
6759	But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. lll	No
6776	It's between a woman, God and her doctor. sss	No
6784	I was an altar boy. sss	No
6862	Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. mmm	Yes
6881	I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills. lll	Yes
6882	But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. lll	Yes
6883	And I'm very proud of that. sss	No
6903	But I got a better plan. sss	No
6910	If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American. mmm	No
6917	Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. lll	Yes
6946	Americans ought to have it too. sss	No
6963	There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. mmm	No
6986	The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history. mmm	Yes
6992	And that's what we're going to do. sss	No
6993	We're going to protect Social Security. sss	No
7021	And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs. lll	Yes
7023	I have a plan to put America back to work. mmm	No
7033	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. lll	Yes
7049	But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. mmm	No
7064	We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. mmm	Yes
7074	And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs. lll	No
7082	I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. sss	No
7102	The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. mmm	No
7131	Well, I'm glad you raised that question. sss	No
7141	One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families. lll	Yes
7142	What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. mmm	No
7143	We also need to hold on to equal pay. sss	No
7145	That's not right in America. sss	No
7162	You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. mmm	No
7180	Is that a new question or a 30-second question? sss	No
7215	Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget. mmm	Yes
7236	There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. mmm	No
7269	But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. lll	No
7272	In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. mmm	Yes
7291	I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old. mmm	No
7319	Now I'm the senior Democrat on it. sss	No
7336	Now, let me just share something. sss	No
7340	If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? lll	No
7346	I agree, we shouldn't have quotas. sss	No
7349	Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? lll	Yes
7351	I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. lll	Yes
7389	Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith. mmm	No
7394	And people all find their ways to express it. sss	No
7396	And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. lll	No
7454	I love the strong women around me. sss	No
7455	I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters. mmm	No
7471	And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight. mmm	No
7510	I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. lll	No
7512	I ask you for your trust. sss	No
7517	And God bless the United States of America. sss	No
7524	"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. "" mmm"	No
7525	I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America. mmm	No
7539	I want to thank you for listening tonight. sss	No
7540	I'm asking for your vote. sss	No
7583	Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba. lll	No
7586	There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. mmm	Yes
7596	There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked. mmm	No
7600	In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present. mmm	Yes
7637	But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. lll	No
7650	I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. mmm	No
7653	Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. lll	No
7657	Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. lll	No
7702	We are a goldfish bowl before the world. sss	No
7722	Let me s- look also at what I did. sss	No
7743	There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. mmm	Yes
7747	Now looking to what we ought to do in the future. mmm	No
7789	We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. lll	Yes
7836	Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. mmm	Yes
7839	I was the floor manager. sss	No
7847	Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work. lll	No
7871	I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. lll	No
7923	On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon. mmm	No
7939	Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States. lll	No
7944	We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. sss	Yes
7981	But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. lll	Yes
7994	You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate. lll	Yes
8010	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked. mmm	Yes
8016	I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. lll	No
8123	This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. lll	No
8124	I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. mmm	Yes
8136	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. mmm	No
8164	That is the obligation upon our generation. sss	No
8188	Is the United States standing still? sss	No
8222	What kind of programs are we for? sss	No
8229	I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. mmm	No
8239	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most. lll	No
8255	Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee. mmm	No
8310	In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. mmm	No
8319	I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program. lll	No
8353	Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider. lll	No
8411	As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. lll	Yes
8422	Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? sss	No
8437	My objection here is not the cost in dollars. sss	No
8460	And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. lll	Yes
8468	Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. lll	Yes
8533	That's why we have to continue to be alert. sss	No
8546	Now that isn't the test of whether America moves. sss	No
8551	Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. lll	Yes
8562	I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government. mmm	No
8596	And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. mmm	No
8597	But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves. lll	No
8605	The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. mmm	Yes
8612	The means are at issue. sss	No
8668	What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. lll	Yes
8710	Why not leave it with them? sss	No
8718	Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. mmm	No
8778	When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. lll	Yes
8824	That is just a downpayment, in my opinion. sss	No
8835	But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. mmm	No
8876	We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from. lll	Yes
8886	And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. lll	Yes
8928	And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. lll	Yes
8961	This is 1980 and not 1966. sss	No
8974	Now also, with regard to the figures about California. sss	No
9000	Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that. lll	No
9009	Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. mmm	Yes
9017	On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. mmm	Yes
9027	With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all. lll	No
9063	I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. mmm	No
9083	A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. mmm	No
9128	Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate. mmm	No
9130	"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree. lll"	No
9136	We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college. mmm	No
9145	I know what it takes to get this economy going. mmm	No
9150	I'm going to change that. sss	No
9164	Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. sss	No
9170	And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. lll	Yes
9190	Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job. mmm	Yes
9243	We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. mmm	Yes
9244	Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades. mmm	Yes
9247	We've also got to look to the future. sss	No
9255	We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. mmm	Yes
9272	So where'd the increase come from? sss	No
9283	I was in coal country. sss	No
9292	I'll get America and North America energy independent. sss	No
9294	We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. sss	No
9332	How much did you cut them by? sss	No
9333	I'm happy to answer the question. sss	No
9348	Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent. mmm	Yes
9350	And production on gas -- sss	No
9355	And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up. mmm	Yes
9367	I don't think the American people believe that. sss	No
9395	And we need to win that future. sss	No
9396	And I intend to win it as President of the United States. mmm	No
9457	Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class? sss	No
9461	And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. mmm	No
9464	A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. lll	Yes
9475	Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00. lll	Yes
9487	It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. mmm	No
9494	I think that grows the economy. sss	No
9495	I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. lll	No
9503	The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. mmm	Yes
9516	We don't have to live like this. sss	No
9535	Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion. lll	Yes
9591	Well, Katherine, that's a great question. sss	No
9592	And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. lll	No
9623	I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. lll	Yes
9627	She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night. mmm	No
9630	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. mmm	No
9632	In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. mmm	Yes
9635	I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago. mmm	Yes
9640	An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. mmm	Yes
9656	Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. lll	Yes
9668	And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have. lll	No
9677	And I appreciate that question. sss	No
9683	The time -- the time... sss	No
9693	Let me come back and -- and answer your question. mmm	No
9694	President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. lll	No
9704	He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. mmm	Yes
9716	I know how to make that happen. sss	No
9722	We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started. mmm	Yes
9724	Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created. mmm	Yes
9731	We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided. lll	Yes
9733	Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. sss	Yes
9735	But the last point I want to make is this. mmm	No
9796	He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent. mmm	Yes
9817	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. mmm	Yes
9818	The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. mmm	Yes
9829	Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery. lll	Yes
9835	And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. lll	Yes
9836	Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. mmm	Yes
9860	Thank you for your question. sss	No
9862	But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. mmm	No
9867	I want it to be streamlined. sss	No
9868	I want it to be clearer. sss	No
9872	We should make sure our legal system works. sss	No
9874	There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. mmm	Yes
9876	So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. mmm	No
9888	I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island. mmm	No
9897	Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years. lll	Yes
9929	He was asked this on Univision the other day. sss	No
9950	Mr. President, I'm still speaking. sss	No
9952	Mr. President, let me finish. sss	No
9984	I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something. mmm	No
9992	And we want to encourage that. sss	No
10040	Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one. mmm	No
10043	And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. mmm	No
10060	Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America. lll	Yes
10088	Can you say that a little louder, Candy? sss	No
10098	The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how -- mmm	No
10102	I'm happy to have a longer conversation -- sss	No
10196	But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be... sss	No
10261	OK. We need to create jobs here. sss	No
10262	And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. mmm	Yes
10275	The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. lll	No
10276	And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president. mmm	Yes
10292	We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. mmm	No
10298	We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one. mmm	No
10333	Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it. mmm	No
10337	I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. mmm	No
10338	I care about our kids. sss	No
10359	I will get us on track to a balanced budget. mmm	No
10372	I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known. mmm	No
10386	And I want to fight for them. sss	No
10437	Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. mmm	No
10448	And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. lll	Yes
10451	The middle-class need a rescue package. sss	No
10455	And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. lll	No
10461	And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. sss	No
10462	You go to the heart of America's worries tonight. sss	No
10464	It's our job to fix the problem. sss	No
10465	Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. mmm	No
10467	We have to keep Americans' taxes low. sss	No
10469	Let's not raise taxes on anybody today. sss	No
10472	We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. lll	No
10479	And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America. mmm	No
10494	But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual. lll	No
10498	She knows how to create jobs. sss	No
10508	Prosperity is not just going to trickle down. sss	No
10513	And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. lll	No
10514	Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices. mmm	No
10555	Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill. lll	Yes
10574	I think it depends on what we do. sss	No
10579	Americans' workers are the best in the world. sss	No
10586	And we've got to give them a chance. sss	No
10587	They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again. mmm	No
10597	Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much. sss	No
10605	When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion. mmm	Yes
10608	And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. lll	Yes
10610	So here's what I would do. sss	No
10615	We are mortgaging our children's future. sss	No
10629	Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. mmm	Yes
10630	And we need to reform. sss	No
10634	I don't expect you to watch every vote. sss	No
10659	I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs. mmm	No
10682	So we've got to deal with that right away. sss	No
10685	And we can do it. sss	No
10687	So that would be priority number one. sss	No
10692	We do need to look at our records. sss	No
10699	That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States. mmm	No
10707	Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate. lll	No
10713	I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. sss	No
10719	And, by the way, I want to go back a second. mmm	No
10720	Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. mmm	No
10723	We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together. mmm	No
10730	That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. mmm	No
10737	We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. mmm	No
10738	But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. lll	No
10753	Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden. lll	Yes
10762	Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. mmm	No
10771	I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad. mmm	No
10794	So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. lll	No
10799	Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. mmm	Yes
10803	Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. lll	Yes
10815	I want to get to Medicare in a second. sss	No
10822	Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. mmm	Yes
10834	When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. mmm	Yes
10842	And our best days are ahead of us. sss	No
10859	Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it? mmm	No
10863	Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. mmm	Yes
10874	And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment. mmm	No
10882	And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. mmm	Yes
10889	We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need. lll	No
10892	I'm just trying to keep up with John. sss	No
10899	I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate. mmm	No
10901	By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. mmm	No
10927	If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. mmm	Yes
10952	Well, thank you for the question. sss	No
10955	And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. mmm	No
10959	Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. sss	No
10967	I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. mmm	No
10970	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? mmm	No
10974	But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. lll	No
10978	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it. mmm	No
10998	So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference. mmm	No
11001	All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. mmm	No
11025	Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. lll	No
11026	And that is one of the challenges that America faces. mmm	No
11040	Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. mmm	No
11049	We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion. lll	Yes
11061	Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake. mmm	No
11062	If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in? lll	No
11065	And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible. lll	No
11070	Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. lll	Yes
11072	And that's what I intend to do when I'm president. mmm	No
11074	Well, let me just follow up, my friends. sss	No
11080	And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. lll	No
11081	But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. mmm	No
11094	And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. mmm	No
11112	And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. lll	No
11130	And that is to get the support of the people. mmm	No
11132	And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick. lll	No
11145	It'd be fine with me. sss	No
11191	We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan. lll	No
11195	And we want a democracy in Afghanistan. sss	No
11199	And I've had conversations with him. sss	No
11203	We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. sss	No
11204	We have to do a lot of things. sss	No
11210	We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat. mmm	No
11228	But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors. lll	No
11234	And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken. mmm	No
11235	But we can't just provide moral support. sss	No
11240	The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners. mmm	No
11266	And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe. mmm	Yes
11277	Well, thank you, Terry (ph). sss	No
11278	And thank you for your service to the country. sss	No
11293	And I think we can do that. sss	No
11295	But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place. lll	No
11299	It would be a game-changer in the region. sss	No
11302	And I will do everything that's required to prevent it. mmm	No
11313	Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. mmm	Yes
11327	But here's what I do know. sss	No
11333	And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? lll	No
11340	That's what's at stake in this election. sss	No
11351	There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans. lll	No
11354	I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business. lll	No
11357	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times. mmm	No
11665	I thought that was a good model. sss	No
11676	I don't think we agree on that. sss	No
11975	And I think that's a private matter. sss	No
12145	And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. mmm	No
12157	I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. mmm	Yes
12163	We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. mmm	Yes
12246	And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. sss	Yes
12540	That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists. lll	Yes
12557	And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. mmm	No
12568	And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. lll	No
12574	I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. sss	Yes
12591	In 1957 I was in Havana. sss	No
12606	And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. lll	Yes
12609	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. mmm	Yes
12613	But are we doing enough in these areas? sss	No
12619	Are we doing enough in that area? sss	No
12651	I think we are today. sss	No
12690	Now, what can we do? sss	No
12701	He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains. lll	Yes
12736	So that is my answer to this question. sss	No
12750	Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. mmm	No
12780	What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. lll	Yes
12791	I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. mmm	No
12829	This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. mmm	No
12832	I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. lll	No
12885	We can make it move. sss	No
12922	If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign. mmm	No
12990	Let's talk about civil rights. sss	No
12994	Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America. lll	No
13002	It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. mmm	No
13003	And this means more than what we've been doing. sss	No
13122	The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. lll	Yes
13129	The treaty does not include these two islands. sss	Yes
13144	Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. mmm	No
13149	There have been many wars in the history of mankind. mmm	No
13153	Now, we may not succeed. sss	No
13187	What do we do then? sss	No
13198	But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom. lll	No
13206	I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. mmm	No
13295	I don't suggest that, I don't support it. sss	No
13303	On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce. lll	No
13322	Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. lll	No
13346	The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited. mmm	No
13361	My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. lll	Yes
13388	I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate. mmm	No
13396	We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. lll	No
13403	We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. lll	No
13462	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. mmm	No
13469	I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less. mmm	No
13502	I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. lll	No
13521	Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. mmm	Yes
13790	I thought you'd forgotten I was here. sss	No
14104	So I have to stand up for myself. sss	No
14659	I don't think we're a declining nation. sss	No
14752	Then the question is, can we govern? sss	No
14890	In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. mmm	Yes
14892	In addition, we've brought down inflation. sss	Yes
14899	And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. lll	Yes
14911	We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office. mmm	Yes
14925	It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. mmm	Yes
14926	It is now running at 12.7%. sss	Yes
14930	Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. mmm	Yes
14933	We don't have inflation because the people are living too well. mmm	No
14937	I'll have to get this out very fast. sss	No
14964	He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor - 122% increase - and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees lll	Yes
15027	I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. lll	Yes
15084	That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out. mmm	No
15125	I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. lll	No
15149	Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have. mmm	Yes
15166	Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. lll	Yes
15167	To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. lll	No
15222	We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. mmm	Yes
15259	I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can. lll	No
15380	Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights. mmm	Yes
15409	I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on. mmm	No
15416	I've been President now for almost four years. sss	No
15418	I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. mmm	No
15422	I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. sss	No
15426	And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. mmm	No
15445	Next Tuesday is Election Day. sss	No
15460	I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. lll	No
15462	We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years. mmm	Yes
15491	And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. lll	No
15525	You know, the American people are fair. sss	No
15527	They want to judge it on the record itself. sss	No
15559	And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that. mmm	No
15561	And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch. mmm	No
15564	The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks. mmm	No
15565	And they know who appropriates the money. sss	No
15570	And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them mmm	No
15578	He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it. lll	Yes
15583	will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States. lll	No
15597	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation. lll	No
15602	The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law. mmm	No
15607	I'm not going to do that; I won't do that. mmm	No
15626	As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that. lll	Yes
15632	I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way. lll	No
15633	So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November. lll	No
15638	So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it. lll	No
15640	And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people. lll	No
15641	But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people. lll	No
15645	I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin. lll	No
15646	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. lll	No
15648	It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country. mmm	No
15682	It's our vision of America. sss	No
15686	I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better. lll	No
15689	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide. sss	No
15690	But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues. lll	No
15718	They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze. mmm	No
15726	Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay. lll	No
15730	Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make. mmm	No
15731	Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent. mmm	No
15750	So military security and economic security go hand in hand. mmm	No
15751	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. mmm	No
15763	Can we start the clock over? sss	No
15787	Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me. mmm	No
15789	We were proud of them. sss	No
15796	But more than that, they are role models. sss	No
15801	These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. mmm	No
15810	And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace. lll	No
15829	I had something very nice to say in there. sss	No
15842	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect. mmm	No
15856	I salute those who participate in the political process. sss	No
15874	We may have different approaches. sss	No
15881	the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign. mmm	No
15905	But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it. mmm	No
15930	It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction. lll	No
15933	The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously. lll	Yes
15937	See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel. mmm	No
15938	I served at the UN. sss	No
15939	I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else. lll	No
15947	We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table. mmm	No
15987	The Congress is doing a better job of it. sss	No
15989	But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that. mmm	No
16006	And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security. lll	No
16014	I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year. mmm	Yes
16015	He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. lll	Yes
16017	We do not have to do it. sss	No
16044	I won't support judges like that. sss	No
16046	But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret. mmm	No
16047	And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments. lll	No
16075	Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income. lll	Yes
16093	But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. mmm	No
16099	We're going to tell you how to do it all. mmm	No
16101	You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America. mmm	No
16116	I just have to correct the record. sss	No
16128	But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. lll	No
16131	It's a contract between generations. sss	No
16154	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products. lll	Yes
16184	So I'll just keep saying, I am one. sss	No
16186	I'm not going to do that. sss	No
16187	That boo was excessively loud. sss	No
16193	I believe in our parks. sss	No
16227	I will not agree to another debate. sss	No
16233	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it. lll	No
16236	But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane. mmm	No
16246	But it's not getting out because there are too few debates. mmm	No
16256	(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point? sss	No
16257	Most Americans believe in basic values. sss	No
16258	We have differences about how to achieve them. sss	No
16263	But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success. lll	No
16269	But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces. mmm	No
16274	Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region. lll	No
16275	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East. lll	No
16276	Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence. lll	No
16281	And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries. lll	No
16307	Maybe the Vice President has an answer. sss	No
16308	But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff. mmm	No
16313	Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department? mmm	No
16315	This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base. lll	No
16316	I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power. mmm	No
16320	So I am one who believes that we can sss	No
16332	I believe that public service is honorable. sss	No
16340	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress. mmm	No
16388	Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light. mmm	No
16392	I want to invest in our children. sss	No
16402	America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible. mmm	No
16408	And I ask for your support on November 8th. sss	No
16410	Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World. mmm	No
16467	Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time. lll	No
16502	When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s. lll	Yes
16509	And this is why a tax reform is so important. mmm	No
16528	I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now. lll	Yes
16579	But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair. lll	No
16600	We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. mmm	No
16615	The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. lll	Yes
16626	We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level. mmm	No
16631	In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. mmm	Yes
16674	We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary. lll	No
16692	The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars. lll	Yes
16699	Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field. lll	No
16782	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes. sss	Yes
16828	Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. mmm	No
16847	So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with? lll	No
16851	I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. lll	No
16853	And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich. lll	Yes
16857	Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. lll	Yes
16882	But I think the feeling is misplaced. sss	No
16896	That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States. lll	No
16909	If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation. lll	No
16927	I might go back to one other thing. sss	No
16988	But I think it's time to talk about the future. mmm	No
16991	It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. lll	No
16996	I believe in our country. sss	No
17000	In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration. mmm	No
17012	I owe everything to you, the people of this country. mmm	No
17034	We must make this next century the century of the individual. mmm	No
17110	At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. lll	Yes
17111	And so, I think that the lines can meet. sss	No
17121	As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. mmm	Yes
17134	I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference. mmm	No
17138	Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need. lll	Yes
17159	Everybody remembers that; people know what happened. sss	No
17219	We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line. mmm	Yes
17264	We all know the possibility of terrorism. sss	No
17274	I am a son of a Methodist minister. sss	No
17283	I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. mmm	No
17287	When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country. lll	Yes
17331	It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. lll	No
17361	The American people want to keep opening doors. sss	No
17389	I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. lll	Yes
17392	All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. lll	Yes
17420	It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. mmm	Yes
17434	As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have. lll	Yes
17476	This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. mmm	No
17485	But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. mmm	No
17506	You've got another life involved. sss	No
17509	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? lll	No
17523	But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? lll	No
17550	In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around. lll	Yes
17578	I'm not going to increase taxes. sss	No
17610	You remember the last time you said that? sss	No
17619	You can't wish it away. sss	No
17646	On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. lll	Yes
17649	We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. lll	Yes
17655	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. lll	Yes
17667	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. mmm	No
17681	Certainly education and training is crucial. sss	No
17686	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off. mmm	No
17692	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. mmm	Yes
17695	I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. mmm	No
17721	There's no way of glossing around that. sss	No
17749	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training. lll	No
17766	Will you finally touch that defense budget? sss	No
17773	I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82. lll	No
17810	I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. lll	Yes
17850	Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? mmm	No
17855	But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. lll	Yes
17858	Today it is up a plus 4 percent. sss	Yes
17883	I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. mmm	No
17898	Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? mmm	No
17971	This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. lll	Yes
18007	People out there listening know what I believe. sss	No
18074	It's the hardest decision a president makes. sss	No
18117	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. sss	No
18120	They just need the help to be trained. sss	No
18139	This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there. mmm	No
18225	But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again. lll	No
18380	I understand how hard it is. sss	No
18381	I get the casualty reports every day. sss	No
18410	It's what leadership is based on. sss	No
18412	I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do. mmm	No
18509	"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"" sss"	No
18589	He's a brave, brave man. sss	No
18627	But a president must always be willing to use troops. mmm	No
18768	The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind. mmm	No
18859	And I have great respect and admiration for his wife. mmm	No
18860	I think she's a terrific person... sss	No
18918	Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president. mmm	Yes
18933	My opponent opposed the missile defenses. sss	Yes
19006	The issue is what you do about it. sss	No
19059	I appreciate your listening tonight. sss	No
19061	And may God continue to bless our great land. sss	No
19262	But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country. mmm	No
19417	And I hope we can do better. sss	No
19641	And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. lll	Yes
19924	Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. lll	Yes
20127	Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. mmm	Yes
20456	I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. sss	No
20717	When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father. mmm	No
20870	Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. sss	No
21237	I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace. mmm	No
21636	They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail. mmm	No
21704	Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer. lll	Yes
21947	I was in the Lomax AME Church. sss	No
21954	Therefore, you don't know what's it like. sss	No
22462	I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one. mmm	No
23088	And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time. lll	Yes
23421	China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are. mmm	Yes
23567	Plus, I want them all voting for me. sss	No
23611	I was an altar boy. sss	No
23743	Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much. sss	No
23761	I believe America's best days are ahead of us. sss	No
23821	I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. lll	Yes
23824	Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. lll	No
23850	I believe experience counts, but it's not everything. sss	No
23855	And we have to change in this country. sss	No
23864	In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. mmm	Yes
23865	We need a new approach. sss	No
23866	The same old experience is not relevant. sss	No
23895	If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man. mmm	No
23905	And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism. mmm	No
23906	It's a question of character and judgment. sss	No
23971	I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. lll	Yes
23972	We've got to have no more trickle down. sss	No
23991	Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. mmm	Yes
23993	And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. mmm	No
24010	And that's about all I can say in a minute. mmm	No
24016	If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. mmm	No
24017	We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. mmm	Yes
24031	I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts. lll	No
24047	So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base. lll	No
24050	I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made. sss	No
24077	Why do we have to do it? sss	No
24087	(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear. mmm	No
24089	If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. mmm	No
24105	You see, I have a fundamental difference. sss	No
24117	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route. mmm	No
24138	So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. lll	No
24166	No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that. mmm	No
24199	Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it. sss	No
24209	But first we must have an aggressive jobs program. sss	No
24231	Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works. mmm	No
24246	I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch. mmm	No
24255	In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right. sss	No
24256	I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress. mmm	No
24294	That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. mmm	No
24306	So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong. mmm	No
24352	Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it. lll	Yes
24358	And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. lll	Yes
24364	If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China. lll	No
24405	I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out. lll	No
24419	But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it. lll	No
24426	We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up. mmm	No
24429	But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions. lll	Yes
24432	It's a different world now. sss	No
24450	I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents. mmm	No
24464	I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that. lll	No
24466	But it's gotten too much. sss	No
24478	And I think, my gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if every child had that love and support. mmm	No
24495	The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down. mmm	Yes
24496	But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs. mmm	No
24512	Anytime you think you want to legalize drugs, go to a neonatal unit -- if you can get in. mmm	No
24524	And these old boys are not going to quit easy. mmm	No
24529	I'm very proud of him. sss	No
24537	Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime. mmm	Yes
24544	That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president. mmm	No
24553	We are all in this together. sss	No
24554	We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose. mmm	No
24559	Our diversity is a strength. sss	No
24562	I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody's in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate -- because we don't have time for it. lll	No
24564	We have got to pull together. sss	No
24577	We are being murdered economically because we have too many drop-outs, we have too many low birthweight babies, we have too many drug addicts as kids, we have too much violence, we are too divided by race, by income, by region. lll	No
24584	I do think it's fair to note -- he can rebut it -- but Arkansas is one of the few states that doesn't have any civil rights legislation. lll	Yes
24610	"Call me, let me know."" sss"	No
24639	Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness. sss	No
24648	Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive. mmm	Yes
24683	This is a town where the White House says, Congress did it; Congress says, the White House did it. mmm	No
24693	I mean, look at the facts. sss	No
24694	Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare. mmm	Yes
24711	What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs. mmm	No
24748	The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. mmm	No
24752	We can do better, and we must. sss	No
24767	We got the most expensive health care system in the world; it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy, and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality. lll	Yes
24790	I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people. lll	No
24794	It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend. mmm	No
24798	Think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself, isn't it time to stop talking about it? mmm	No

24821	I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America. lll	Yes
24827	He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway. lll	Yes
24852	On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. lll	No
24853	We don't need to do that any more. sss	No

26145	But we have to prove we can pay for them. mmm	No
26228	We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president. mmm	Yes
26344	Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act. lll	Yes
26564	Those are my best ideas about it. sss	No
26794	All the people who may still be watching or viewing. mmm	No

26982	But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. mmm	No
27094	We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military. mmm	No
27100	And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. lll	No
27106	Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. sss	No
27107	You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden. mmm	Yes

27391	Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947. mmm	Yes
27403	But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works. mmm	No
27503	And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon. lll	No
27519	And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. mmm	No
27683	They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. mmm	No
27688	Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. lll	No
27722	We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. sss	No

27961	And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices. lll	No
27967	I'm optimistic about the future. sss	No

28356	The Senate Budget Committee -- sss	No

28394	This is a fair plan. sss	No
28438	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow. mmm	No
28598	Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me. mmm	No
