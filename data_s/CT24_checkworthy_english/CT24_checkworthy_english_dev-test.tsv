Yes

11095	But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.	No
608	And I can go on and on.	No
26937	And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.

28660	I don't think that's the role of the president.	No
190	All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.	No
22000	The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.	Yes
9563	When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?	Yes
15862	"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time."	No
13300	I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.	No
40597	No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem.	No
19735	I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.	Yes
16860	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	No
6068	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	No
20619	Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.	No
23655	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	No
11066	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	No
9370	If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.	Yes
9276	And what was the cost?	No
10460	And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.	No
13126	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	No
14499	And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.	No
6012	We've got to do it now.	No
31965	So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?	No
2643	But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.	No
8337	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	No
21134	If you don't have trust in that, I do.	No
6508	We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.	No
20409	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	No
27689	And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.	No
1609	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	No
18109	That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.	No
31935	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.	No
1702	Number five, champion small business.	No
9830	Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.	No
26162	I think it also is a strength.	No
6507	We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	No
17245	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	Yes
8600	I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.	No
10525	But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	No
8087	They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.	No
11504	And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.	No
17287	When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.	Yes
15358	This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.	No
13719	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	No
27730	We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.	Yes
29765	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	No
19428	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	Yes
24015	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	Yes
6626	Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.	No
1668	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	Yes
30130	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	No
25421	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	No
12462	Jim, thank you very much.	No
10572	But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.	No
33724	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.	No
22769	I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.	No
21742	And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.	No
21154	I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.	No
28715	And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.	No
19137	That, to me, is the key.	No
18331	And we support the U.N. efforts there.	No
32485	She's raising your taxes really high.	No
2619	And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...	No
13324	Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.	No
24985	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	No
14845	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	No
2074	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	No
8305	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	No
20059	And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.	No
2058	Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?	No
20128	So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.	Yes
1572	I served an a hospital authority.	No
16692	The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.	Yes
14654	So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.	No
23878	In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world.	No
12960	I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.	No
17191	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	No
27513	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	No
