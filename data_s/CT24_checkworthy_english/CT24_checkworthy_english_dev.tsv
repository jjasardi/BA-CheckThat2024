28243	Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.	No

13819	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	No
4089	Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.	No

24009	We've created a mess, don't have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.	No
6624	We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.	No
27676	That was the right thing to do.	No
19984	When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.	No

33937	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.	Yes
17530	Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.	No
24006	We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.	No
25872	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	No
16990	It's a time for unity.	No
10239	China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.	No
2401	Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.	Yes
16455	Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	Yes
21616	Help me pass these programs.	No
23555	We've got to open up the possibilities of this research.	No
28284	We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.	No
23362	Now, if you're a Red Sox fan, that's OK.	No
27641	That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.	No
9029	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	No
27020	...that's a -- I indicated...	No
11813	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	No
29330	Well, that is just not accurate.	No
25762	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	No
738	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	No
27227	But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does.	Yes
2564	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	No
29346	Is it President Obama's fault?	No
5795	And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	No

29359	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	No
26265	You don't guarantee they get the job.	No
3283	But let me comment on the report.	No
22798	I went to New York.	No
27118	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	No
27173	Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	No
33463	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	Yes
8411	As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.	Yes
19472	And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	No
21794	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	No
15709	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	No
18730	So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.	Yes
6584	I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.	No
33265	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	Yes
3687	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	Yes
4257	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	No
33669	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	Yes
1272	And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.	Yes
28387	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	No
26059	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	No
4408	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	No
10935	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	No
33832	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.	No
1501	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	Yes
4190	And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.	No
22500	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	No
16077	Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.	Yes
1209	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	No
13477	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	No
9929	He was asked this on Univision the other day.	No
24256	I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.	No
16944	I would have uh - done it opposite.	No
26753	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	No
30044	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	No
29216	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	Yes
8387	The Vice President and I disagree on this.	Yes
8243	The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.	Yes
12274	Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.	No
16296	Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	No
9906	"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, ""I will veto the DREAM Act"", that would allow these young people to have access."""	Yes
15418	I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.	No
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	Yes
28621	It's not the right thing to do.	No
13254	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	No
33786	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.	Yes
7281	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	No
13282	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
39697	There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before.	Yes
403	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	No
11104	They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.	Yes
29825	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	No
763	And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.	Yes
32842	And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.	No
20695	Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	No
1672	Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take.	No
32983	And we have a vacancy.	No
15933	The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.	Yes
17111	And so, I think that the lines can meet.	No
40916	And I'd stop giving to the oil industry - I'd stop giving them federal subsidies.	No
6062	We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.	No
33667	We know how to get control of the debt.	No
24998	Now, they claim they're not.	Yes
30300	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	No
34287	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	No
7788	And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.	No
34104	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	No
29134	And we have a winning fight.	No
18301	The president and I have always agreed on that.	No
3275	That conference has met six times.	No
15255	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	Yes
12970	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
24420	And I think I'm on the right track.	No
5912	That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.	Yes
32511	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	No
18581	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	Yes
7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	No
29025	I have kept the faith.	No
21718	Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.	Yes
12298	I think there's a difference.	No
28977	And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.	No
33954	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	Yes
21443	As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	No
26810	There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	No
15638	So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.	No
1084	And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.	Yes
19031	That's the country that I'm going to fight for.	No
3517	Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	No
28609	I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.	No
2111	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	No
2621	Let me just finish the point.	No
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
10751	It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	No
5539	Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.	No
21113	There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.	Yes
7466	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	No
26997	What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.	Yes
17212	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	Yes
4008	And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.	No
19262	But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.	No
15309	And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.	Yes
13098	We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.	No
32635	And I did as secretary of state.	Yes
3485	And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.	No
26529	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	No
10219	The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.	Yes
37513	So don't tell me about this.	No
69	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	No
7298	I know something about prosecuting.	No
6866	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	Yes
12927	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	Yes
34410	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	Yes
14162	Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.	No
18654	That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.	No
12132	So it is a priority for me.	No
11457	I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.	No
12853	And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.	No
22805	Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.	Yes
15271	As a matter of fact,.	No
27206	You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.	No
25636	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	No
14304	What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.	Yes
22974	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	No
25094	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	No
24107	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	No
13450	But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.	No
15099	First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.	No
2641	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	No
9876	So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.	No
4177	I am not parsing words.	No
3631	And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.	Yes
26987	It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.	Yes
23263	I am not going to raise taxes.	No
4041	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	No
18078	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	No
22154	The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.	No
4244	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	No
12808	But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	No
8026	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	No
13217	But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.	No
6211	It was a trial lawyer's dream.	No
33889	So it's not one thing.	No
1459	In the last month, we've had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs.	Yes
25801	In the last four years we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality.	No
20459	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	No
19092	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	No
22866	He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.	No
26148	That's why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.	No
27686	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	No
33336	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	No
18236	And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	No
22264	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	No
705	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	Yes
10992	Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	No
13365	Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.	No
25413	Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.	No
15763	Can we start the clock over?	No
20581	There's now a general strike going on.	No
16154	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.	Yes
22936	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	No
19621	And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.	No
9356	I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.	Yes
26398	She finally gave it up.	No
11159	"This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, ""Next up, Baghdad."""	Yes
14345	We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?	No
32375	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	Yes
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
29284	I will bring -- excuse me.	No
8014	Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.	Yes
24681	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	No
11571	He is an indicted war criminal.	Yes
19298	We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.	Yes
29440	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	Yes
14960	I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.	Yes
17192	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	No
10752	I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.	Yes
24607	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	Yes
18269	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	No
16126	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	No
28225	That's why I'm so strong for accountability.	No
5645	We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.	No
8544	As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	No
20839	And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	Yes
12637	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	No
20732	I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.	No
1210	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	Yes
7786	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	No
9768	And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.	No
7066	We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.	Yes
19917	There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.	No
7847	Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.	No
31	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	No
6733	And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.	No
14889	We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.	Yes
977	The best America is yet to come.	No
31945	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	No
9012	"And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government."	No
19101	Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	No
17020	A president can't be all things to all people.	No
22181	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	No
12139	It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	No
7507	Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.	No
15522	If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	No
6243	We should try to reduce these circumstances.	No
27106	Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.	No
15821	say, he is our hero.	No
26728	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	No
29938	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	Yes
18554	But I have a plan to do it.	No
7525	I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America.	No
2129	Social Security is structurally sound.	No
4381	We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.	Yes
15091	Barbara, you've asked that question twice.	No
7284	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	Yes
8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	No
20491	As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.	No
6923	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	No
22310	Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	No
12874	India started from about the same place that China did.	No
28121	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	No
21413	Young people with high grades can't get a job.	Yes
24094	People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	Yes
6238	This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.	No
9078	And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.	No
37711	The issue is the American people should speak.	No
7787	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	No
20156	Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.	No
19456	You don't buy any gun.	No
39876	The foreign countries are paying you a lot.	Yes
27954	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	Yes
7721	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	Yes
12390	And so I think this is an issue.	No
18732	And I think this will work.	No
17127	It gets larger even with growth.	No
14182	What should I have done?	No
25827	You're a cardiologist, it wouldn't affect you.	No
4326	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	Yes
8204	But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	No
12626	The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?	No
12286	I think it's a fundamental difference.	No
39841	I never got any money from Russia.	Yes
21157	It's time for a new look.	No
10691	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	No
9034	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	No
4312	I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.	No
12064	So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.	No
21045	And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.	Yes
11622	I wouldn't have supported either.	No
25505	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	Yes
24561	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	No
28273	We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.	No
2638	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
11883	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	No
25835	On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.	Yes
20733	I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.	No
25073	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	No
25216	"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	Yes
9688	I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.	No
28712	And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.	No
6013	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	No
15554	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	Yes
9807	This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.	No
19594	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	No
3834	Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.	Yes
5828	... talking about it this evening.	No
20514	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	No
24044	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	No
1741	I'll call it the economy tax.	No
12444	And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country.	No
25776	This is an historic time.	No
19061	And may God continue to bless our great land.	No
22696	I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.	No
26303	They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities.	Yes
12780	What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.	Yes
3047	The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.	No
26204	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	No
15464	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	Yes
7027	I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.	No
26404	You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	No
8482	When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	No
3649	It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.	No
33471	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	Yes
6339	We need to have rewards.	No
29927	But let me just tell you.	No
4192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	No
29120	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	No
25602	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	No
18922	Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.	No
1959	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	No
3101	They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.	No
21345	There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.	Yes
16377	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	Yes
18635	So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.	No
23145	The federal government is going to run it.	No
22157	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	No
626	But look, let me sum it up.	No
623	We will do what we do best.	No
28112	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	No
25714	But that progress is only the beginning.	No
23548	But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research.	No
32855	To go back to the very, very first question.	No
22612	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	No
19413	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	Yes
18197	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	Yes
3131	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	Yes
20072	And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	No
25297	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	No
32985	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	No
25695	They live all across the country.	No
29818	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	No
2931	The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.	Yes
16191	But I'm not going to do that.	No
21501	"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times."	No
10145	But let me mention another thing.	No
18790	Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.	Yes
24046	They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	No
2416	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	Yes
2383	And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.	No
1066	They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	No
29636	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	No
8111	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	No
15356	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	No
7806	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	No
6678	And if we do that, we can have an impact.	No
21672	If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.	No
6860	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	Yes
6196	I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.	No
26084	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	No
26808	This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed.	No
12644	I believe that the world is changing fast.	No
12617	Will the Congo go Communist?	No
39908	I don't know, maybe you're not.	No
19581	We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.	No
8310	In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.	No
13405	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	No
24843	Take a look at the Middle East.	No
17326	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	No
22904	Daniel, I don't support a draft.	No
3496	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	No
6477	I want to thank Arizona State as well.	No
3890	Jim, Jim, this is a big...	No
20469	I found a couple of other things we agree upon.	No
16590	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	Yes
7636	Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.	No
17206	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	No
18282	"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion."""	No
31861	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.	Yes
25864	What service are you in?	No
20333	It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	No
17188	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	No
3656	Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?	No
20637	I would take the use of force very seriously.	No
28943	(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.	No
9765	And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.	No
1040	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	No
20494	I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.	No
1432	It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.	Yes
33733	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.	No
24640	The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	No
2686	What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.	No
7078	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	No
10375	That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.	No
26116	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	No
16951	Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.	No
13335	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	No
9395	And we need to win that future.	No
15969	In my own state, we did it.	Yes
34205	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	No
9451	And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.	No
3885	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	No
8508	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	Yes
26825	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	No
29849	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	No
17417	And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.	No
90	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	No
24531	If drugs were legal, I don't think he'd be alive today.	No
12689	This is the major recommendation that he's made.	Yes
23483	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	No
20463	I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.	No
11520	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	No
2402	Now, the last point I'd make before...	No
22615	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	No
15405	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	No
32515	It's called the Buffett rule.	No
2955	Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?	No
24410	You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.	No
25605	That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.	No
16640	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	Yes
3365	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	No
17027	On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.	No
9592	And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.	No
32161	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	Yes
18243	We're standing with you strong.	No
18841	And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.	No
30374	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	No
24750	I'm tired of being told we can't.	No
23450	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	No
2657	And by the way, I've had that experience.	No
25053	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	No
24583	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	No
18113	We've got a plan to do so.	No
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
27958	Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.	No
6126	Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.	No
24397	We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.	Yes
21593	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	No
32478	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	Yes
7621	The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.	Yes
12878	Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.	No
25093	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	No
26527	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	No
474	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	No
9832	The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.	No
23010	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	No
33725	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
29302	Some of them I voted for.	No
23064	We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles.	No
25393	But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.	Yes
20910	Now, private schools play a great role in our society.	No
30016	Because look at the mess that we're in.	No
5922	"When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, ""This can't go on."""	Yes
29793	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	No
2304	And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.	No
10524	I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.	No
19002	And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.	No
11130	And that is to get the support of the people.	No
18750	And we knew where the fuel rods were.	Yes
17608	"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	No
4081	And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.	No
26754	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	No
31921	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	No
24473	If I had to solve all the problems that face this country and I could be granted one wish as we started down the trail to rebuild the job base, the schools and so on and so forth, I would say a strong family unit in every home, where every child is loved, nurtured, and encouraged.	No
30403	"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""	Yes
14685	They don't want us talking about each other.	No
15687	We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	No
16041	But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	No
19923	The American people should make up their own mind.	No
12752	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	Yes
14910	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	Yes
10974	But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.	No
16167	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	Yes
15444	But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.	No
26050	On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	Yes
1710	Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	No
18316	That's what we have here.	No
21695	I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.	No
27130	And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.	No
38236	And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help.	No
27800	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	Yes
28686	You bet there's things that government can do.	No
33973	No, it was -- we put up the American flag.	Yes
21129	This is a big issue.	No
12814	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	Yes
1988	... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.	Yes
7706	They set a low standard of materialism.	No
4108	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	No
13623	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	No
16836	They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	Yes
28313	And there's just not going to be enough money.	No
4230	So, this is a very difficult situation.	No
10509	We've got to help the middle class.	No
20021	Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.	No
16066	These appointments are for life.	No
13663	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	No
34014	I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.	No
1806	Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.	No
9480	So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.	Yes
29468	You've proposed an approach that has a...	No
7687	From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.	No
32633	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	No
27250	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	No
5854	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	No
14031	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	Yes
1819	I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.	No
12394	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	No
9919	But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.	No
33561	Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...	No
12043	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	No
5907	Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.	No
33993	I find that just astonishing.	No
34303	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	Yes
26475	Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it's the best four years ever.	No
28104	That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.	Yes
296	I come from a different point.	No
297	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	No
3135	Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.	Yes
26405	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	No
10549	Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	No
24912	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	No
937	But there are two main focal points of this election.	No
27244	And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.	No
16508	And this is what the Republicans have done to us.	No
21016	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	Yes
2652	How do we get schools to be more competitive?	No
28085	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	No
34129	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	No
34144	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	Yes
13252	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	Yes
26	"You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee."""	No
13899	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	No
9171	And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.	No
21947	I was in the Lomax AME Church.	No
21171	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	No
10928	And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.	Yes
32910	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	No
7781	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	Yes
21305	Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.	No
2490	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	Yes
3826	And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.	Yes
6382	All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.	No
28472	When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.	No
21419	Now, whose fault is that?	No
4149	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	No
3806	And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.	No
643	But I don't think we need these other systems.	No
37840	How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?	No
20985	We end up being problem solvers.	No
26822	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	No
1569	A lot remains to be done.	No
21082	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	Yes
11329	I came from very modest means.	No
9418	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	No
9472	Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.	No
9297	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
25296	And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.	No
2876	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	No
29630	And the other thing I think is important...	No
15389	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	Yes
19445	But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	No
28711	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	No
14326	I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.	No
26804	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	No
23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	No
15881	the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.	No
25403	The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.	No
12796	They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.	Yes
25849	We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing.	No
23050	And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	No
23727	Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	No
25912	We had to make cuts.	No
8119	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	No
29616	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	Yes
7765	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	Yes
23666	And as I said: You can run but you can't hide the reality.	No
17987	And the Taliban are no longer in power.	Yes
4282	I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.	Yes
13383	Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?	No
21498	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	Yes
5970	"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	Yes
16438	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	No
15890	Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	No
7593	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	No
17509	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	No
28298	And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	Yes
24834	In the Oval Office, you can't predict what kind of crisis is going to come up.	No
10160	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	Yes
11927	But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.	No
30262	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	Yes
24821	I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.	Yes
12703	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	No
28565	Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.	No
17303	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	No
14264	And I just had to work that in.	No
1502	That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.	No
28411	I'm not going to ask them.	No
27373	If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	No
13211	"General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take."	Yes
33652	They're going to start hiring people.	No
7176	What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	No
13284	And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.	No
9825	The president wants to do well.	No
12113	If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	No
16963	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	Yes
8041	These two islands are in the area of freedom.	No
18549	And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.	No
5505	It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.	No
24575	And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.	No
22981	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
5540	Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.	No
21745	This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.	No
8783	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	Yes
19045	We will continue to stay on the offense.	No
17559	I believe we need some fairness.	No
15145	The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	Yes
27124	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	No
10899	I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.	No
30349	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	No
26443	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	No
15324	It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.	No
18395	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	No
10506	But there are other folks out there.	No
16151	We never should go back to that.	No
9057	We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.	No
794	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	No
2257	The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.	No
29972	And I'm very, very proud of it.	No
22644	He's trying to attack me.	No
33192	It goes back to the founding of our country.	Yes
8962	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	Yes
8807	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	No
18611	They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.	No
11555	I thought he made the right decision to do so.	No
19700	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	Yes
26347	We had a better idea.	No
32283	I want to say just a couple of things.	No
12582	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	Yes
33011	The question was about the Supreme Court.	No
12587	I don't believe it is.	No
19584	You ask when do you decide to deploy them.	No
8258	I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.	No
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
27428	In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.	Yes
26679	I supported the President's trade policy.	Yes
21467	But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.	No
21953	But I don't think it's fair to say, you haven't had cancer.	No
24475	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	No
2945	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	Yes
20624	It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.	No
18489	And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.	No
24163	In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.	No
1268	We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.	No
10950	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	No
25267	The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.	No
19626	We have not been firm and strong.	No
2865	Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.	Yes
1532	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	No
29917	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	No
13315	I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.	No
19220	Are your children getting a better education.	No
26022	They appointed a commission I was on that commission.	No
20560	That's what a governor gets to do.	No
8967	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	Yes
16188	Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?	No
22113	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	Yes
25369	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	No
20130	When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.	No
30340	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	Yes
40175	We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare.	Yes
26065	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	No
20274	That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.	Yes
16020	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
13186	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	No
25612	We need to move on.	No
25640	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	No
29048	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	No
1848	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	No
17364	They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.	No
14932	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	No
19466	The administration says they support the instant check.	Yes
23167	What means something is: Do you have a plan?	No
27446	And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.	No
12412	But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.	No
28036	Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.	No
24688	No, we'll get it done.	No
24729	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	No
1843	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	No
10363	The president said he would.	No
28258	I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.	No
7920	It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.	No
14851	That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.	No
8396	I believe in the balanced budget.	No
16782	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	Yes
25249	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	No
21720	But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.	Yes
14219	I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.	No
30067	So she talks about taking them out.	No
2741	And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.	No
27457	But it's good that we have them.	No
25208	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	No
20971	The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.	No
25691	But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.	No
20104	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	Yes
27333	We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.	No
19312	I thought that was wrong.	No
6269	I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.	No
5567	You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.	No
30362	She doesn't have the stamina.	No
32295	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	No
29351	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	No
8846	me that the Federal grants that come with.	No
20365	Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	Yes
4113	"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	No
10046	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	No
26973	Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.	No
29633	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	No
32681	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	Yes
26375	You can decide which of us you think are right.	No
31849	I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.	No
23910	"Some say, ""well, you're a little old fashioned."""	No
18115	I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.	No
26363	I can't fix the statistics.	No
21223	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	No
5515	Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	No
20321	The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	No
29369	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	Yes
34375	I've been waiting for years.	No
18553	I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.	No
20712	If I could say one thing.	No
9350	And production on gas --	No
2693	Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.	No
6988	I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.	No
14849	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	No
7632	First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.	No
13133	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	Yes
8754	But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.	No
16580	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	No
29401	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	No
11475	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	Yes
18802	So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.	No
13441	Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.	No
27455	It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	No
4380	So this is a national security issue.	No
13464	He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.	No
1097	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	No
25957	Marijuana use is up 141percent.	Yes
20394	If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.	No
28630	This is a bad tax.	No
12784	Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.	No
28428	And that fact is just not right.	Yes
18232	That is the best way.	No
27966	Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	No
8149	The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.	No
25339	But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.	No
17402	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	Yes
22774	And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.	No
25991	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	No
21455	I think you have to look at it.	No
27278	We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.	No
28835	I'm against quotas, they're illegal.	No
37945	I look forward to talking about it.	No
3734	They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.	Yes
6861	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	Yes
360	And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	No
33325	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	No
22587	I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.	Yes
24522	Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks.	No
31922	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	No
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
19982	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	No
20086	I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.	No
25905	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	No
9726	But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.	Yes
361	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	Yes
21334	I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.	No
21329	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	No
25180	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	No
6612	I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.	No
15375	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	No
20518	I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.	Yes
13295	I don't suggest that, I don't support it.	No
19927	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	Yes
13626	Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.	Yes
17593	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	Yes
16547	We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.	Yes
30397	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	Yes
6583	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	Yes
15773	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	Yes
9804	He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.	No
28304	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	No
25597	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	No
17760	This is how I'm going to get it done.	No
22421	I'm just not going to do that.	No
820	He says mistakes were made.	No
12798	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	No
350	I'd say around 30 percent.	No
33188	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	No
17907	I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.	No
18714	My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.	Yes
22847	At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.	Yes
7238	And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.	No
33943	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.	No
25186	There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.	Yes
7700	We need all the talent we can get.	No
16237	If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.	No
26372	It didn't hurt the economy.	Yes
18437	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	No
12713	You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.	Yes
34135	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	No
20306	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	No
18690	I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle.	No
7631	I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.	No
3643	It is not a good deal for the American people.	No
5637	And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.	Yes
24602	We have increased funding for AIDS.	Yes
2682	We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	No
7951	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	No
22695	Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.	No
22319	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	No
34418	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	No
16559	Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.	No
21788	If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	No
7316	I'll give you an example.	No
40351	What I see is American, United States.	No
30443	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	No
9938	My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.	No
6337	We need to reform these programs.	No
27605	And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.	No
21564	I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.	No
32416	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	Yes
39189	They should go to iwillvote.com.	No
30324	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	No
11492	The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.	No
9128	Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.	No
22946	I could do a better job.	No
1125	I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.	No
26584	And there is a connection.	No
28453	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	No
16286	My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola.	No
33162	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	No
23553	I don't know how you draw that line.	No
2623	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	No
17142	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	No
29197	They have a VAT tax.	Yes
9819	There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.	Yes
22812	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	No
8157	We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.	No
29740	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	Yes
10856	That's the good news, my friends.	No
27604	And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	No
28380	I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.	No
26423	We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.	Yes
23544	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	No
11823	I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.	No
1289	The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.	No
11999	I think that measures like these are important.	No
27547	Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.	No
11802	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	No
3939	And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.	Yes
16663	We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.	No
17284	And I think we're all together on that.	No
2852	The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.	No
11220	I said before, watch Ukraine.	No
9470	My philosophy on taxes has been simple.	No
3151	Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.	No
11886	It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.	No
5729	Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.	Yes
5943	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	No
8136	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.	No
12068	Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	No
32538	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	Yes
21710	I think you put your finger on a major problem.	No
13302	Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.	No
8277	I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.	Yes
20058	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	No
21915	And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.	No
13795	I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.	No
21595	But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.	No
7959	The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.	Yes
33029	And you look at our miners.	No
25469	Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.	Yes
22229	The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.	Yes
12545	Let us move now to the future.	No
12908	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	Yes
20868	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	No
32731	How stupid is our country?	No
33631	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	No
14580	I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.	No
3513	And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	No
29848	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	No
13872	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	No
14718	I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.	No
14740	And may God bless the US of America.	No
26841	If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this.	No
18568	And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.	No
825	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	No
18745	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	No
9971	Let me give you some advice.	No
13735	And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.	No
11674	It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.	Yes
15511	And I made a good selection.	No
15774	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	No
17725	Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.	Yes
24313	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	No
23538	And the president has chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that.	No
26427	Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.	Yes
33860	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	No
20506	Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.	Yes
11280	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	No
3647	I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.	No
26777	Now that was quite an admission.	No
21807	We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.	Yes
8560	It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.	No
27991	This nation is the hope of the earth.	No
25508	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	Yes
8612	The means are at issue.	No
27690	But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.	No
1291	This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.	Yes
