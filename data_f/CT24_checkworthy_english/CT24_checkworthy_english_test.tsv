40262	"Joe Biden, he's running against."
40330	This HEROES Act has been sitting there.
40340	"It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities."
40344	"But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country."
40353	"They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue."
40413	Let me just tell you.
40467	"I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it's and it's illegal."

40828	"Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breathe."
40833	"We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I'm proposing."
40839	I know more about wind than you do.
40842	"And the fumes coming up - if you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make - make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean."
40847	It's not powerful enough yet to - to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world -
40849	"So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do?"
40850	We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world.
40919	We actually do give it to solar and wind--
40926	Will you remember that Pennsylvania?
40948	"But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me."
40952	The other side wanted to get together.
40969	We're going to choose science over fiction.
40970	We're going to choose hope over fear.
40973	We can deal with systemic racism.
40974	"At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs."
41038	We need to send Joe Biden back to his basement and reverse American decline.
41042	We -- we also cannot succeed when the Congress spends trillions and trillions of dollars.
41044	"And, finally, we need to lower your gas prices."
41045	We're going to open up all energy production.

41074	It was over 10 percent when I became governor in 2010.
41109	"So, I don't know if I get a chance to respond."
41122	I have gone on to found multibillion dollar companies.
41123	"I did it while I married my wife Apoorva, raising our two sons, following our faith in God."
41136	What I care about the fact is that no one is telling the American people the truth.
41169	"Now, Martha, you asked earlier who is the most best prepared for this job?"
41193	"But, I'll let you all parse that out."
41205	Now is not the time for on-the-job training.
41238	"Do you want a super PAC puppet, or do you want a patriot who speaks the truth?"
41247	Can I address the COVID issues the Governor brought up?
41268	"So, if you buy a battery in this country, you buy a solar panel, it's being produced in a plant in China powered by coal where it's being powered by oil and gas at 20 percent off."
41276	We have 14 percent fewer state employees in Arkansas after I left the government than when I took over as governor eight years ago.
41278	And I pledge to reduce it by 10 percent our federal nondefense workforce.
41281	"But let me tell you, I've been a federal prosecutor."
41313	Let's just answer the question.
41320	"No, I didn't -- I didn't raise my hand."
41353	"And the right way is first of all, yes, is climate change real?"
41358	"And so, that's not helping the environment."
41376	"I came to the conclusion that America can do for anyone what she's done for me if we focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities and protecting America."
41416	And can't we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?
41432	"I know a lady in Florida named Penny, she survived multiple abortion attempts."
41440	I understand Iowa and New Hampshire are going to do different.
41441	But I will support the cause of life as governor and as president.
41458	It's supported by 70 percent of the American people.
41469	We haven't had 45 pro-life senators in over 100 years.
41470	"So no Republican president can ban abortions, any more than a Democrat president could ban all those state laws."
41490	"And this issue is, of course, very important."
41526	And it is the most important issue for women and for the unborn child and for our country that we get this right.
41529	How we have to enhance maternal care.
41567	"I mean, it's extraordinary to think about the violence that's claiming innocent lives literally every week in every major city in this country."
41569	What we need is -- is strong commitment to law enforcement.
41576	We will bring our cities back.
41588	"So, what a President Christie would do is appoint an Attorney General who would instruct each of the 93 US attorneys that they are to take over the prosecution of violent crime in every one of those cities that are failing to do so."
41590	"Secondly, what we need to make sure that each and every one of these criminals understand is that the laws apply to everybody, and when Hunter Biden fills out a fake application, a false application, for a gun permit, and then is facing a 10-year mandatory minimum, which was mandated by legislation sponsored by his father, and then you have a Justice Department that walks away from those charges."
41595	"So, the reality is, we have a crime wave in this country, and we know how to fix it."
41600	Do we have the spine to bring them back?
41616	"We don't have an identity crisis, Vivek."
41617	We're not looking for a new national identity.
41619	We just need government as good as our people.
41647	"Bret and Martha, I just thought it's interesting, you asked your question about the problems we're having in big cities."
41658	"One, enforce the law when it comes to crime."
41665	"And so, we have to have respect for our justice system and the rule of law."
41687	Here's the -- here's the bottom line.
41703	We're skating on thin ice and we cannot set a precedent where the party in power uses police force to indict its political opponents.
41760	"I will always stand up for our Constitution, regardless of the political pressure."
41778	Seventeen percent of Republicans have confidence in our Department of Justice.
41784	"You have to shut down the FBI, actually have the courage to get it right."

41848	"OK, I'd like to answer."
41852	And he deserves not grudging credit.
41861	And I do think that we need to give him credit for that.
41862	"But what I will also tell you is, look, I mean, when it comes to whether President Trump should serve or not, I trust the American people let them vote, let them decide."
41864	We have to look at the fact that three quarters of Americans don't want a rematch between Trump and Biden.
41866	We can't win a general election that way.
41894	"Well, Mike, why don't you say this?"
41899	That is how we move our nation forward.
