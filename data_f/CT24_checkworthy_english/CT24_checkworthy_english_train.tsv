5538	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	No

12572	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	No
22145	I'll close on this point.	No
24987	And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	No
33501	I find that just absolutely...	No
25989	Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	No
17010	We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	No
33268	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	No

20798	Take for example the marriage penalty.	No
20822	A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	No
16191	But I'm not going to do that.	No
24338	And so, we've got a good military.	No
25432	But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	No
28296	It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	Yes
25895	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	No
21494	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	No
2276	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	No
12109	Secondly -- and they're good.	No
27495	But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	No
28760	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	No
33388	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	No
13927	We cannot lose those jobs.	No
19667	And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.	No
23311	Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	Yes
21359	Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.	Yes
31994	But it is things that people say.	No
14869	Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	Yes
32721	Let me tell you something.	No
20647	Morale in today's military is too low.	No
7678	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	No
16497	And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	No
25261	Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
19212	That's what I want to focus on.	No
30083	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	No
34241	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	No
27300	And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.	Yes
25295	And one of those dreams is justice.	No
89	I asked for and received the same briefing.	No
3987	Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	No
8082	The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.	No
6507	We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	No
15895	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	No
16247	There will be no more debates.	No
12460	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	No
12856	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	No
26443	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	No
33944	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	No
17983	We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	No
13963	You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	Yes
3361	Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?	No
13602	On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	Yes
11012	Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	Yes
18672	And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	No
20341	Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	Yes
26512	Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	No
24805	That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	No
28424	Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.	No
19443	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	No
18605	The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.	Yes
11035	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	No
17910	That's not fair for our future.	No
12516	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	No
16479	In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	Yes
24813	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	No
19657	The President held it up.	Yes
14438	Come on, that's not leadership.	No
16601	We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	No
34214	Which is a big mistake.	No
19296	I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	No
16993	And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	No
514	I know what strong political leadership is.	No
29610	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	No
634	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	No
22372	A message just won't do it.	No
9422	Candy, it's not going to --	No
13540	And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
27091	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	No
4286	I've got to make this point, Jim.	No
25817	We've always had at least 7 percent.	Yes
15053	With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.	Yes
14725	On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	No
15759	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	No
28392	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	Yes
604	I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	No
2996	When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	Yes
26404	You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	No
8665	I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	Yes
33311	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	Yes
33884	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	Yes

10220	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	Yes
7612	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	No
25058	I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	No
312	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	No
525	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	Yes
34042	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	Yes
3508	And I promise you that that will happen.	No
29857	I'd just like to respond.	No
5930	And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	No
461	And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	No
32896	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	No
3176	So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	No
4032	No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	No
22969	And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	No
20453	I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	No
27114	I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.	No
33170	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	No
27175	Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	Yes
22712	He came to see me.	No
20636	And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	No
18754	And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.	No
18519	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	No
16348	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	No
21498	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	Yes
25836	But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	No
26008	And we will do that.	No
10935	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	No
11652	In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	Yes
18560	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	Yes
2203	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	Yes
21619	That's the problem with our system.	No
32650	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	No
7425	I've reached across the aisle.	No
15117	I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	Yes
24079	And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.	No
4130	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	Yes
17303	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	No
7902	It would not be appropriate for me to do so.	No
9653	Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	No
2885	Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	No
6782	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	No
1041	I know I'm ready for it.	No
12660	I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.	No
6980	Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.	No
9288	That's not the right course for America.	No
10686	Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	No
860	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	No
786	You judge on the record.	No
16677	We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.	Yes
8914	Well, we've seen what has happened.	No
4192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	No
15193	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	No
22989	We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.	No
3850	But that's Senate inside baseball.	No
10542	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	Yes
16238	We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	No
3293	Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	No
13448	Particularly some of the smaller producers.	No
25512	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	No
34246	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	No
7656	And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.	No
14297	You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	No
31890	I apologize to the American people.	No
12477	I want to do something about Social Security.	No
25800	First of all, let me say what we have done.	No
1893	Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.	No
20120	And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	Yes
6809	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	No
14062	This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	No
2618	When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	No
13680	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	No
8167	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	No
32401	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	No
9214	And we would have lost a million jobs.	Yes
13894	I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	Yes
533	But it takes presidential leadership.	No
17557	In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.	Yes
9609	We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	Yes
23166	I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	No
12752	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	Yes
29645	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	No
25515	Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	No
15169	The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.	No
8088	That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	No
7768	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	Yes
27464	Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	No
25419	It's more difficult to defend this nation.	No
19856	I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	Yes
24142	Now, we can do better.	No
1760	But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	Yes
822	He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	Yes
14952	We've had the Central Accounting.	Yes
20054	I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.	Yes
11760	I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	No
12763	Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	No
32905	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	No
12976	I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	No
27441	They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	No
3900	We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	No
31959	I am going to help the inner cities.	No
1297	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	Yes
25584	This evening we talked about national strength.	No
22167	We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	No
16518	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	No
20676	And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	No
6312	I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.	No
15832	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	No
2654	I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	No
3802	And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	No
18010	And that's what they are.	No
25229	For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	Yes
13712	Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.	Yes
27629	And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	No
19743	But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	No
8392	I think we're going to have to do it.	No
9046	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	No
21495	Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	No
21415	In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	Yes
25837	We need to help people who are between jobs.	No
27535	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	Yes
30207	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	No
8166	I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.	No
22553	Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	No
4041	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	No
27	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	No
3182	Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	No
25086	As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	No
1970	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	No
18735	He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	No
26603	You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	No
3329	Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
32511	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	No
1752	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	No
22200	And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	No
12025	An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.	No
23090	He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.	Yes
12519	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	No
27218	I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	No
18661	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	No
27102	When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	Yes
13225	They may - are not my style.	No
18270	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	No
32446	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	Yes
18982	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	No
14367	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	Yes
25051	We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	No
7198	The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	Yes
3005	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	No
2388	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	Yes
33549	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	Yes
15069	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	Yes
15709	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	No
23332	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	Yes
26958	Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	Yes
18040	And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	No
20736	I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	No
9637	This is what I have done.	No
27954	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	Yes
10112	#NAME?	No
14398	Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.	No
20424	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	No
24451	I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	No
9773	"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""	No
19881	And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.	No
25517	And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	No
29201	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	Yes
9016	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	No
6205	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	No
24829	Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	No
2280	I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	No
12921	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.	No
13007	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	No
549	But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	No
23129	Let me see where to start here.	No
27152	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	No
27476	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	No
32667	And you know what happens?	No
12022	The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.	No
24083	These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.	No
8746	We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.	No
30064	We will take out ISIS.	No
3982	And I know how to work with them.	No
28169	I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.	No
22845	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	No
15246	And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	No
15435	And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	No
262	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	No
1113	The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	No
8874	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.	Yes
21098	Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	No
8340	Now, I can only say this.	No
392	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	No
11976	And I think that's the way it ought to be.	No
24304	We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.	No
33557	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	No
20961	It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	No
16738	And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.	No
10729	"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""	No
6394	You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	No
10724	"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	No
13515	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	Yes
764	And I've said mistakes were made.	No
3731	Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	No
16870	And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	No
12646	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	Yes
880	When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	No
1894	We created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
16016	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	No
7821	So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.	No
17350	They don't want this arms race.	No
8154	It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.	No
29430	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	No
10057	Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	No
22179	It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.	Yes
25016	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	No
10463	Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	No
4163	"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	No
23267	I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	Yes
16635	I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	Yes
7189	I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	No
13296	I would disagree with it.	No
25592	As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.	No
1460	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	No
25593	That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	No
25068	Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	No
18195	Anyway, that's for another debate.	No
19374	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	No
10936	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	No
19653	They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	No
24492	I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	No
32664	She talks in favor of the rebels.	Yes
14732	But we've got to do even better.	No
12541	Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	No
7820	On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.	Yes
30330	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	No
12614	What are freedom's chances in those areas?	No
19561	He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	Yes
15363	Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	No
17997	Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	No
12631	And that's what concerns me.	No
27654	And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	No
27113	I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.	No
1751	Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	No
8356	Mine has been in the executive branch.	No
29828	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	No
6618	We talk about fiscal matters.	No
24519	You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	No
22032	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	Yes
22820	The military's job is to win the war.	No
19338	Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	Yes
4133	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	Yes
10300	That's what brings jobs in.	No
29056	I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	No
2173	They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.	No
20042	I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	No
1499	I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	No
30154	Just -- would you like to hear...	No
13170	Yes, we should make a great effort.	No
15023	We also are pursuing housing programs.	No
14852	That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	No
128	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	No
19944	I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	No
2021	And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	No
1013	Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.	No
20245	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	Yes
8767	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	Yes
14627	I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.	No
10832	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	Yes
21457	In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	Yes
7679	What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	No
18751	And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	No
34155	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
7284	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	Yes
12977	I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	No
12414	That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	Yes
25093	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	No
18064	The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	Yes
34056	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	Yes
26632	See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	No
27804	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	No
28982	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	No
7010	The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	Yes
30371	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	No
16057	I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	Yes
21703	I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.	No
6597	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	Yes
33575	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	No
25328	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	Yes
23272	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	No
21572	I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.	Yes
8259	Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.	No
9015	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	No
7947	And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	No
4271	And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.	No
33173	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	No
391	It will require some funds, John.	No
7887	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	No
12941	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	Yes
1361	You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.	No
24969	I'm sure that you appreciate that.	No
29001	Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.	No
22148	And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	No
7984	It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.	No
22146	You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	No
17852	I promised a new beginning.	No
19196	And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	No
13732	I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	No
15030	We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	No
28161	That adds up to 44 million people.	Yes
16685	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	No
17630	I gave you back some of that time.	No
26016	But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	No
8023	It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.	No
6037	And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	No
5660	I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.	Yes
20499	Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	No
26456	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	No
1155	This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	No
32685	You don't even know who the rebels are.	No
20031	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	No
13128	That is the present American position.	No
1808	So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	No
7795	And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	No
12122	I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.	Yes
26085	One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	No
8830	Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	No
25966	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	No
28202	In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	No
25363	But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.	No
1940	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	Yes
3286	This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	No
33991	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	Yes
12042	"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."	No
19661	So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	No
27630	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	No
19813	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	No
2734	I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.	No
7419	We have to change that.	No
2631	And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	No
2317	You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.	No
8557	And I think we have a powerful country.	No
32443	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
16398	There is much to be done.	No
22724	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	Yes
32191	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	Yes
19269	Well, the people need it, that's the point.	No
25940	My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.	Yes
20935	That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	No
110	Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.	No
24193	Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.	No
5984	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	No
27165	We want a peaceful planet.	No
25496	Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.	No
11362	I believe in its future.	No
15665	Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.	No
19139	For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	Yes
19864	And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	Yes
23056	"""I think that makes sense."	No
21857	I think it's a good program.	No
25882	I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	Yes
15967	It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	Yes
21342	Let me just mention three things very quickly.	No
34293	But I just have to...	No
17614	And what did you do right after the election?	No
487	One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	No
8421	Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	No
19919	And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	No
13800	I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	No
26354	We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	No
1602	But I believe together we can make great progress.	No
12394	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	No
8003	So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.	No
8623	I think we're ready to move.	No
13820	For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	Yes
7398	There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	No
32633	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	No
9072	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	No
28934	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	No
12659	We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
11401	Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.	No
32363	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	No
4141	He did not say that.	No
17689	Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.	No
28123	Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	No
14768	And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	No
24293	We've got to help them.	No
19365	But I want to go back to 1965.	No
29474	And when you look at what you are proposing...	No
13174	He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	Yes
13660	He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	Yes
2487	That's the wrong way to go.	No
2945	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	Yes
25857	But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	No
16098	I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.	No
19599	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	No
19933	The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	Yes
2352	I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.	No
19360	They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	No
966	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	No
3479	And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	No
12248	And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	No
3055	As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.	Yes
2967	(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	No
15882	I think the American people would appreciate that.	No
19115	It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	No
23826	I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.	No
8589	But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.	No
6144	Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.	No
29223	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	Yes
494	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	No
27105	But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	Yes
10018	And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	No
33484	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	No
13501	Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	Yes
15964	But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	Yes
32654	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	No
12261	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	No
10095	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	No
3882	They just passed an electoral...	No
23407	If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	No
14051	And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	No
12212	We're working hard to sign up children.	No
4125	And you know what happened?	No
11332	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	No
2393	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	No
22454	Now that will change America.	No
33394	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	Yes
32085	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	Yes
26613	In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.	Yes
3585	That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	No
24702	All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	No
15417	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	No
25001	I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	No
28635	I'm from a big farm state.	No
23069	You know what he did?	No
19558	We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	No
15756	That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.	No
6600	He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	Yes
25709	I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	No
1536	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	No
30461	I'm going to be able to do it.	No
1186	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	No
24940	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	No
16992	It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	No
27669	This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	Yes
8694	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	Yes
30096	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	Yes
11513	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	No
24462	So I do think we need to strengthen family.	No
20646	And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	No
3635	It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	No
387	Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	No
18882	And I've never wavered in my life.	No
26418	We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	Yes
8948	And that state we controlled spending.	Yes
11686	During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	No
1830	And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	Yes
4109	But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.	No
1497	So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	No
21505	Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.	No
301	I'm not questioning his patriotism.	No
2327	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	No
5943	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	No
33328	Now, I want to build the wall.	No
8390	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	No
9448	The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	Yes
27586	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	No
22569	I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.	No
26733	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	No
23394	You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	No
3036	It's for their security as well as ours.	No
21459	And everything in there says what I am for.	No
19500	Talking about this and this.	No
17379	But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	No
23044	And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	Yes
17678	Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	No
4017	"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	No
27926	I've met some of those people.	No
21596	We hear all the negatives.	No
11885	Is anybody being discriminated against?	No
31939	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	Yes
2215	So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	Yes
19889	If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	No
9611	And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	Yes
5725	Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.	No
25623	The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.	No
6020	Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	Yes
3078	And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	No
21594	Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	No
22024	On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	No
21020	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	No
24814	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	No
13636	And we are bleeding arterially.	No
28373	And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	Yes
20877	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	No
3782	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	No
17626	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	Yes
33891	That is not who America is.	No
7078	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	No
17037	The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	No
29822	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	No
21171	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	No
5687	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	Yes
14430	And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	Yes
21028	Now he's having to say that again.	No
10156	They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	Yes
422	There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	No
12546	It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	No
12639	I have seen us ignore Africa.	No
17482	The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.	No
30145	And you're going to stop them?	No
21263	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	No
17152	Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.	No
22164	We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.	No
32284	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	Yes
27680	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	No
13999	He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	Yes
28907	You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	No
13520	Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	Yes
26365	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	Yes
30417	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	No
26687	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	Yes
20357	Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	No
15150	It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.	Yes
11812	But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	No
2562	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	No
3559	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	Yes
18234	I believe they want to.	No
2400	And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	Yes
2900	And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	Yes
965	I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	No
2875	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	Yes
11202	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	No
22313	Just a fact clarification real quickly.	No
24591	I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.	No
22450	And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	No
20831	Here are the key ingredients.	No
30233	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	Yes
16127	I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	No
15630	(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	No
17496	One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.	Yes
17699	I think the business community wants to get involved.	No
232	The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.	No
7020	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	Yes
11989	So I favor closing the gun show loophole.	No
5578	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	No
26073	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.	Yes
13596	It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	No
15716	We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.	No
21842	People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.	No
33415	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	Yes
25299	And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	Yes
2601	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	No
6148	You all just heard my plan.	No
15529	And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	No
10983	I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	No
23347	And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	No
2651	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	No
2024	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	No
19863	I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.	No
13029	It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	No
30125	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	Yes
11992	If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.	No
10074	That's not what we do.	No
20728	This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	No
16152	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	No
10772	So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	No
10639	Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?	Yes
15312	Well, that just isn't true.	No
17276	And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	No
26537	We'd have that trouble all over America.	No
21790	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	No
7740	When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	No
28716	You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	No
24439	I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	Yes
1785	And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	No
86	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	No
27127	They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	No
21311	Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.	Yes
13935	Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	No
28791	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	No
5499	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	No
25069	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	No
3908	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	No
34037	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	Yes
3716	And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	Yes
23111	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	Yes
19859	Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	No
18457	Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.	No
9035	And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	No
34116	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	Yes
24180	And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	No
25285	That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	No
6212	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	No
4113	"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	No
16515	Well, as a matter of fact there is.	No
32268	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	No
20313	Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	Yes
17252	And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	No
10445	We've got to make sure that works properly.	No
17846	The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	No
20745	Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
12198	That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	Yes
8885	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	No
19897	But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	Yes
16454	Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	No
23199	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	Yes
29102	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	No
8043	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	No
19428	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	Yes
17860	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	Yes
25974	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	No
24190	See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.	No
25015	That is where I think the future of the world lies.	No
31911	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	No
17454	In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	Yes
29214	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	No
8433	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	No
18238	And I hope it's as soon as possible.	No
2128	You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.	No
18311	They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.	No
25851	And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.	No
24322	We must rebuild America's strength at home.	No
12870	They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	No
28426	Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	Yes
7983	Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	No
24078	Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	No
3240	Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	No
20554	I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
27691	We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	Yes
3049	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	No
22331	Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.	No
27266	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	Yes
11447	But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	No
7028	I heard more of the same.	No
34420	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	No
19668	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	No
27686	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	No
11573	Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	No
21031	The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.	Yes
74	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
3976	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	Yes
24503	And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	No
13816	Is the guy out of work better off?	No
19810	I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	No
19723	It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	No
10160	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	Yes
34427	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	No
16149	And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	No
1566	But our country is innately very strong.	No
12837	We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.	No
32460	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	No
17879	"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	No
32262	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	No
24408	It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.	Yes
7812	We must stand for our ideals.	No
8662	The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.	No
3465	But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	No
7172	You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.	No
23367	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	Yes
6498	"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	No
2315	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	No
13419	The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	Yes
243	And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	No
1386	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	No
14475	Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	Yes
17579	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	Yes
11663	And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	No
622	But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	No
25153	Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	Yes
26730	It's God's will, it'll happen.	No
7048	Sure, there's more work to do.	No
515	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	No
15420	As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	No
8389	The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	Yes
17150	And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.	Yes
21686	I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	No
1313	In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.	No
22621	And that was the serious, serious threat.	No
12406	And we need to do something about that.	No
23329	I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	Yes
23915	"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago."""	No
27258	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	No
7809	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	No
1877	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	No
12303	That's not the way I would have done it.	No
33195	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	Yes
18884	He needed to be disarmed.	No
12335	A profound scientist recently made a different --	No
31945	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	No
4305	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	No
163	And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	No
26421	In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.	Yes
21456	I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	No
471	It's as simple as that.	No
17720	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	No
14950	I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.	No
23990	I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	No
13852	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	No
34131	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	Yes
677	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	No
23224	We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	Yes
34250	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	Yes
11858	So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	No
24096	That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.	No
8038	Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.	No
24313	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	No
19100	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	Yes
22272	It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	No
10635	And you know what you'll find?	No
16907	I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.	No
32336	And we need to do our part.	No
24687	And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	No
11119	Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.	No
15702	If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	No
3152	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	Yes
21122	The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	Yes
26658	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	No
14368	So that's what I'll do as president.	No
33256	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	No
1692	Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	No
16270	And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	No
15263	As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.	Yes
13193	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	Yes
16671	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	Yes
883	You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.	No
24583	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	No
3941	And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.	No
14838	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	No
15093	I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.	Yes
21010	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	No
13972	Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	Yes
18835	My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	Yes
21491	Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	No
12797	But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	No
6717	That's not what we want.	No
21410	Now, the facts are we have to fix it.	No
6068	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	No
24995	And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	Yes
14875	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	No
32778	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	Yes
18804	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	No
25884	He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	Yes
5983	And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	No
7619	We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	Yes
10864	And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.	No
19160	Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	No
3619	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	No
7672	He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.	No
13986	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	No
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
8445	I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	No
6051	Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.	No
27723	But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	No
19244	In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	No
10906	You know who voted against it?	No
7330	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	No
10695	I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	No
2018	Well, the economy is still growing slow.	Yes
13406	And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	No
1111	I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	Yes
20778	There is a difference of opinion.	No
8448	Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.	No
29374	I'm very proud of it.	No
34142	They say, what do we need this for?	No
25088	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	Yes
15375	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	No
20751	We're talking about a massive government, folks.	No
25647	I was just going to -- --	No
18531	I think my plan is better.	No
1855	And I think that would be a mistake.	No
11418	And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	No
29303	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	Yes
28910	Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.	No
12988	We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	Yes
1914	My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.	No
22654	I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.	No
9628	I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.	No
6844	We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	No
8032	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	No
6097	And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.	No
16599	This needs to be changed.	No
20082	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	No
21579	I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	No
32922	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	No
28883	You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	No
33289	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	No
7831	This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.	No
29847	Look, one murder is too many.	No
32536	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	Yes
24938	I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	Yes
17905	America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
14193	101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.	No
13452	I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	No
26913	Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.	Yes
27596	But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	Yes
16963	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	Yes
8173	The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	No
8509	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	No
24054	But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	Yes
21646	There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.	No
12223	But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.	No
25634	They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	No
22490	You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	No
5939	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	No
12090	And that's what needs to happen.	No
18197	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	Yes
13673	The answer is to invest and grow this economy.	No
23678	And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	No
10619	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	Yes
7426	I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	No
13264	Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	No
27698	Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	No
21823	Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.	No
11738	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	No
4246	That made no sense whatsoever.	No
20553	It's very clear to me.	No
18898	Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.	No
15415	Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.	No
32266	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	No
26674	"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	No
8225	Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	No
29006	You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	No
22135	We have to have money to do that.	No
13835	The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	No
7152	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	No
17426	I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	No
26322	The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.	No
8695	I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	No
23762	I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	No
24902	To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	No
12759	Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	No
6342	Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.	No
2240	And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.	No
28538	But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	No
911	And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	Yes
19289	Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.	Yes
22274	At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	No
17240	And so, we made a proposal.	No
30123	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	Yes
26317	I'm going to keep my word to you.	No
642	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	No
31843	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	No
2998	Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.	Yes
14842	The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.	Yes
19434	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	Yes
7706	They set a low standard of materialism.	No
26040	We need to reform it.	No
33198	You mentioned the Heller decision.	No
19273	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	No
17278	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	No
25815	"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	No
2569	Well, first, I love great schools.	No
21458	It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	No
23023	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	No
2145	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	No
16811	One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	Yes
12140	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	Yes
24002	So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	No
23246	After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	Yes
3751	It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	No
7997	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	No
21163	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	No
18800	We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.	Yes
12401	And I'm going to try to do better.	No
25168	"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	No
27262	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	No
17148	I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	No
15522	If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	No
28502	And I'm happy to tell you that we have.	No
443	But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	No
6324	That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	No
22631	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	No
4111	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	Yes
11743	We've had some disagreements about that.	No
2584	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	No
18159	Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	No
13468	I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.	No
23315	We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	Yes
21254	And we have a very important decision to make.	No
25566	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	No
6077	We need to have more community health centers.	No
17882	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	No
1343	The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	Yes
2149	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	No
16580	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	No
6561	But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	No
19699	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	No
28452	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	No
25872	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	No
15419	And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	No
24152	And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	No
26960	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	Yes
20530	I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	Yes
14564	Now, I'll tell ya this.	No
25987	They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	Yes
29147	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	No
11493	The sanctions are being violated.	Yes
8506	It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	No
2490	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	Yes
18138	And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	No
20026	I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	No
33069	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	No
12561	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	No
26321	It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	No
19570	You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	Yes
25862	America owes you a debt of gratitude.	No
1362	And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.	No
24858	We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.	No
10961	As you notice, he starts talking about government.	No
8045	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	No
6936	Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	No
13842	But let's take my life in perspective.	No
17095	We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	Yes
33783	But I think it's really an important issue.	No
10234	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	Yes
3986	And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	No
25744	Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.	No
478	I respect his right to disagree with me.	No
6270	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	No
19202	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	Yes
2549	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	No
16541	It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	No
27450	It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	Yes
21913	It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	No
26662	I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	Yes
2277	As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	No
24107	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	No
24551	The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.	No
33229	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	Yes
14234	You've got to go to the people.	No
20465	This is a major problem facing America.	No
17194	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	No
21762	For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	Yes
2456	Let me make one last point.	No
17897	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	No
32582	I will be the president and we will get it done.	No
6777	And that's why I support that.	No
10072	And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	No
11150	Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	No
10442	It hasn't worked out that way.	No
22496	We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	No
5797	But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	No
11952	I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	No
21852	It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.	No
17659	So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	Yes
8327	Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	No
13871	That's one of the things I want to change.	No
30338	I will go very quickly.	No
10124	So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	No
27801	And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	Yes
17587	At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.	Yes
16480	For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	Yes
10609	And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.	Yes
18962	And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	No
1224	We have no energy policy.	Yes
6040	Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	Yes
19746	I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	No
6706	Bob, anybody can play with these votes.	No
19491	So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	No
19141	But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.	Yes
26254	Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	No
13878	That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	No
5956	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	No
16843	You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	Yes
23636	My opponent voted against the ban.	Yes
6452	We're proud to be here.	No
29777	Property crime is down 40 percent.	Yes
405	When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?	No
12748	Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	No
8744	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	No
20680	It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	No
18591	You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.	No
4074	This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.	No
2492	Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.	No
27947	Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.	No
19567	Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	No
4033	And we honor all the service that they've provided.	No
9760	We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	Yes
11667	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	No
5806	And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	No
29500	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	No
25318	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	No
24520	#NAME?	No
2496	It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	Yes
20635	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	No
29795	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	No
19186	Well, I guess some may be better off.	No
28802	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	Yes
7724	Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.	No
8426	But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	No
189	And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.	No
25038	To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	No
24085	We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	No
30364	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	No
571	The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	No
11175	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	No
23482	As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.	No
7508	And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	No
21086	That's the difference of opinion.	No
24793	We've got to change the system.	No
20940	Start asking the question, what do you know?	No
16844	Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	Yes
25208	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	No
26688	And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.	No
8946	And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.	Yes
12273	People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.	No
10554	And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.	Yes
4328	We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.	No
14306	We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	No
29555	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	No
15573	Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	No
21315	If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	No
14565	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
16602	For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	Yes
18807	It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	No
20466	The administration did not deal with it.	Yes
27228	Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	Yes
909	But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	Yes
25986	I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	No
16393	Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	No
8558	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	No
28783	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	No
20957	They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	Yes
15958	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	No
3082	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	No
15604	I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	No
10674	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	No
16492	So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.	No
1852	Donald Trump is a small business.	No
23992	Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	Yes
6054	So here's what my plan does.	No
24536	First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	No
1141	It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	No
7917	That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	No
465	As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	Yes
16409	And I will be a good president.	No
21847	He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	Yes
8018	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	No
27123	This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	No
16010	We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	No
15703	They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	No
27924	You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
24363	Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.	No
27387	We're now at under 285.	Yes
12685	Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	No
12993	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	Yes
14893	Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.	Yes
9514	We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	Yes
14820	I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.	No
10679	Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.	No
28354	(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	No
12563	But all this by itself is not enough.	No
13015	Not one of them selected a Communist government.	Yes
19674	There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.	No
20014	Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.	No
7708	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	No
4343	It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.	No
26387	So we talk about all these new jobs.	No
25716	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	No
13722	It's a fairly rural state.	No
28054	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	Yes
20162	And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	Yes
32908	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	Yes
83	And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	No
20347	Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	No
8720	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	No
2067	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	No
33757	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	No
21389	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.	No
24106	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	No
33413	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	No
31913	But I have tremendous respect for women.	No
34277	This would not be done just on the first day.	No
33653	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	No
25885	But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.	No
4173	We do that all the time.	No
24040	Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	Yes
23571	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	No
9001	But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	No
26836	Could have a chance to serve as president.	No
13609	Just the ground rules here.	No
27870	And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	No
16732	And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	Yes
8223	We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.	No
12429	I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	No
6348	But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.	No
16018	Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.	No
18680	I'd have made a better choice.	No
4402	I'm ready to go at it right now.	No
27681	It's important for the success of Afghanistan.	No
7031	Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
2324	We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	No
14538	Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.	No
19540	I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.	No
3297	And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	No
7765	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	Yes
8508	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	Yes
13761	But I don't think it's fair.	No
123	But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.	No
17851	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	No
18894	I did a lot of work on this.	No
1978	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
22679	And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	No
5517	But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.	No
3510	Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.	No
15339	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	Yes
15493	And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	No
22902	We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.	No
9014	I believe in freedom of choice.	No
17847	Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	No
12948	I served it uh - in the war.	No
22394	How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	No
23961	Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.	Yes
3564	And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	Yes
24593	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	Yes
28616	I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	No
16910	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	No
1787	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	Yes
5548	Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.	No
24379	And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	No
32475	And she never will change.	No
25903	I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	No
7024	And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	No
11947	I agree with that, and I did support that law.	No
6911	I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	No
14707	I just believe it's time to change.	No
18213	We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	Yes
21816	I think you have to take on medical fraud.	No
18098	And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	No
8622	That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	No
15401	It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.	No
26125	Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	Yes
3894	Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.	No
9823	How about the growth of the economy?	No
360	And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	No
346	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	No
7459	"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	No
16088	But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	Yes
28767	I think it's the tone.	No
12834	But let's look at the other side of the coin.	No
7848	Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.	Yes
3316	This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	Yes
154	But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	Yes
27353	Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	Yes
20775	Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	Yes
6321	And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	No
32964	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	No
13146	Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	No
4157	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	No
7420	And as president, I am committed to changing that.	No
2062	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	No
12739	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	Yes
21608	I went to a boys' club.	No
90	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	No
77	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	Yes
810	25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	No
18364	And I honor their sacrifices.	No
13621	And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	No
14843	Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.	Yes
7067	And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	No
21657	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	No
28119	I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	No
1243	This has not been done, unfortunately.	No
26149	You should expect that from both of us.	No
1428	As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	Yes
28418	You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.	No
7811	We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	No
21321	We got to cut it out.	No
7617	And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.	Yes
21812	So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	No
1693	That's not what I'm going to do.	No
20662	If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	No
16686	Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
20753	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	Yes
23651	You know, it's just not that simple.	No
32011	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	Yes
28901	I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	No
15528	And so I'm proud of my choice.	No
28555	If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	No
7591	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	No
14847	In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	Yes
9999	And it's time for them to get serious on it.	No
5515	Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	No
21159	And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	No
26977	Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	No
20390	He said all poor seniors.	No
22935	It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	No
23264	I have a tax cut.	No
9624	Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	No
13537	Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	No
1758	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	No
25407	Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	No
15029	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	No
33221	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	Yes
27653	When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	No
32865	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	No
28421	You talk about eight years?	No
26384	We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	Yes
10987	It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.	No
24311	and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	No
13376	But Social Security is a tax.	No
4110	And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	No
22623	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	Yes
28173	Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	Yes
1519	We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
24743	Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	Yes
33888	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	Yes
2485	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	Yes
18610	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	No
1058	If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.	No
19837	The ones that are out there are doing well.	No
14720	It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	No
33663	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	No
31921	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	No
17267	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	No
27772	We want a world that's stable.	No
21025	One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.	Yes
24777	Let's get on with it.	No
29479	... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	No
26114	We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	Yes
17627	And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	Yes
2499	Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	No
1952	So I'll get rid of that.	No
34434	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	No
9705	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	Yes
13136	We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.	Yes
17503	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	No
9648	Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.	No
11671	I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	No
33628	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	No
14862	And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.	No
10582	They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	No
8384	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	No
5731	So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	Yes
29702	We have to restore trust.	No
25991	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	No
17149	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	Yes
22966	Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.	No
13017	Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	No
23447	And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	No
24499	We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	Yes
8888	Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	No
24292	When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	No
2289	And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.	Yes
31844	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	No
919	I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.	No
26552	First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.	No
20377	If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	Yes
1962	This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.	No
3714	I know how to do that.	No
13938	I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?	No
32182	In '17, it implodes by itself.	Yes
21032	It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	Yes
9608	We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	Yes
4318	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	No
3874	And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	No
16148	I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.	No
32599	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	Yes
33747	I have fought against that as a senator.	Yes
427	It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.	Yes
26805	We should have more debates.	No
29778	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	No
12881	They want to be free.	No
12551	In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	No
26565	Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	No
26430	For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	Yes
11304	And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	No
28909	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	No
3617	I can tell you, it's rife.	No
6754	And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.	No
27488	And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	No
24759	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	No
488	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	No
7665	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	No
22593	He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.	Yes
7897	And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	No
6579	We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.	No
28045	Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.	Yes
26410	That's what we will do.	No
2155	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	No
14542	Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	Yes
16781	I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.	Yes
8430	I favor higher salaries for teachers.	No
25210	I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	No
20050	See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	No
23441	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	No
26656	And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	Yes
3148	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	No
8536	And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	No
2005	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
29655	And we need to be very clear about that.	No
13738	And the people who have jobs --	No
20223	I come from West Texas.	No
14625	And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	Yes
17349	The American people want arms control.	No
1035	Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	No
14619	You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	No
32129	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	No
25486	I don't trust the Russians.	No
27858	Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.	No
32611	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	No
24961	I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	No
855	No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	No
20474	We don't have to do that.	No
33503	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	No
22307	I just want to mention if I could --	No
6625	No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.	No
2984	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	No
588	And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	No
32496	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	Yes
27598	And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	No
11045	When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	Yes
17468	And no one has approached it from that matter.	No
12088	We believe in tough love.	No
16569	I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	Yes
56	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	Yes
3288	And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.	No
6500	I don't really think about him very much.	No
20545	I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	No
7911	Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	No
11869	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	No
20755	He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	No
2460	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	Yes
16261	I am concerned about what that does to our future.	No
16886	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	No
17363	They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	No
23139	There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	No
7664	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	No
2918	But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	No
15306	I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.	Yes
25442	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	No
24210	I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	Yes
24269	We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	Yes
15236	The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	Yes
79	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	Yes
24295	Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	Yes
16630	When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	Yes
33651	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	No
8246	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	No
19906	We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	No
27363	We need to be thinking about cyber security.	No
22765	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	No
25078	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	No
13710	4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	Yes
28571	They're aimed at the real problem.	No
1368	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	Yes
17848	I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.	No
13903	But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	No
25706	And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	No
17708	There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	Yes
17220	We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.	No
13616	Government -- he says invest government, grow government.	No
21856	You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	No
17289	That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	No
13261	Now, why did they reject it?	No
12529	Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	No
16484	And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	No
21095	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.	No
22305	Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.	Yes
29441	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	No
23417	I think you ought to get the break.	No
32398	It was principled, and it was strategic.	No
33749	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	Yes
5766	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	No
28302	Look, we're in an information age.	No
24307	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	No
7087	In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	Yes
23995	And so I just have a different approach.	No
5576	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	Yes
27627	So our troops will come home at that point.	Yes
15451	Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	No
2617	But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	Yes
24257	And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	No
15256	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	No
11581	I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	No
33090	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	No
1892	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
20898	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	Yes
26092	$500 per child under 18.	Yes
17768	If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	No
18585	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	No
14258	That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	No
11509	When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.	No
19548	Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.	Yes
18078	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	No
24681	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	No
13659	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	Yes
25684	I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	No
2747	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	No
14479	I say that to both political parties.	No
28227	We do so in my state of Texas.	No
2947	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	No
13254	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	No
13764	I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	Yes
6875	I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	No
1445	It means that there will be increased hires.	No
21884	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	No
8791	But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.	No
12635	More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	Yes
19058	By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.	No
10181	But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	No
3944	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	Yes
4138	I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.	No
16068	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	No
27539	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
12512	Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	No
29354	But you have no plan.	No
33941	I think it would be a great gesture.	No
28265	But here's what I said.	No
22859	Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	No
1168	And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.	No
3888	That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	No
17651	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	Yes
15210	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	No
1706	That's not the right answer for America.	No
20117	Let's take all these four years in a row.	No
3336	Let me restate uh - our policy.	No
19167	But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.	No
27915	What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	No
975	We live-we bring everybody along.	No
15983	I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	No
15294	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	Yes
34387	No, it's going to totally help you.	No
10852	And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.	No
29012	One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	No
28837	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	No
17811	But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	No
18026	That's why they're fighting so vociferously.	No
18912	And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	No
15642	And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	No
25909	He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	No
26288	How do we pay for it?	No
6769	I completely respect their views.	No
33011	The question was about the Supreme Court.	No
11851	It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.	No
28144	You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.	No
19279	So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	No
16475	And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.	Yes
30229	No, they were taunting us.	No
1169	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	No
21082	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	Yes
21499	So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	No
13841	I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	No
13293	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	No
17857	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	Yes
27196	And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	Yes
26179	6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	Yes
30327	Can they rely on us?	No
25536	I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	No
3374	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	No
523	If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	No
4093	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	No
26398	She finally gave it up.	No
6265	So we've got to get our education system right.	No
6208	And that's the kind of judge that I want.	No
25707	Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	No
25387	And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	No
19208	The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	Yes
13152	Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	Yes
17533	And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.	Yes
16540	I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	No
30404	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	Yes
7085	If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	No
13126	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	No
26222	I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	No
24140	Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.	No
13004	It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.	No
24931	And he drew up this manual.	No
34346	He was criticizing President Reagan.	Yes
20496	I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	No
32874	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	Yes
33934	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	Yes
26904	And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	No
2046	I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	No
27556	And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.	No
30142	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	No
17589	And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	Yes
29105	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	No
23331	Look at the record of the man running for the president.	No
30126	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	No
16011	And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	No
15381	Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	No
28319	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	No
20874	Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	No
2483	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	No
10708	I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	Yes
24101	Your question was on fairness.	No
10310	Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.	No
18546	Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.	No
19129	Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.	No
3688	They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	Yes
12359	I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	No
30009	And I'm very proud of it.	No
15536	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	No
8204	But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	No
28753	They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	No
3156	Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	Yes
25554	But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.	Yes
16581	And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	No
12705	The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.	No
24603	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	Yes
3680	Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.	No
6255	Of course, we have to come together.	No
23544	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	No
20058	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	No
29487	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	No
33031	There is a thing called clean coal.	No
707	You have to make choices.	No
21647	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	No
22281	We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	No
17377	Well, again, I'm running on the record.	No
16111	That is absolutely not true.	No
27060	We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	Yes
26432	You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	No
8869	Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	Yes
14275	Sometimes he has to act.	No
18025	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	No
1768	And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.	No
15808	I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	No
25681	Let me first give you a sports update.	No
7123	We could speed it up.	No
28160	We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.	Yes
32465	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	No
1974	Now, we all know that we've got to do more.	No
14705	I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	No
27071	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	Yes
6577	Now, I'm going to reverse that.	No
22653	I would have brought our allies to our side.	No
29510	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	No
21845	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	No
8066	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	No
22025	You have a raging debate about those plans.	No
3497	A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.	No
17656	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	Yes
19492	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	No
14107	I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.	No
20627	It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	No
1743	At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.	Yes
1057	But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	No
32512	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	Yes
2063	And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	No
9824	It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	Yes
1915	My priority is putting people back to work in America.	No
19422	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	No
27093	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	No
8138	He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	Yes
2873	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	Yes
3136	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	No
11713	Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	No
21563	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	No
29836	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	Yes
20303	The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.	Yes
23212	Thank you for your question.	No
33756	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	No
21401	We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	Yes
34078	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	No
26765	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	No
19114	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	No
34080	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	No
12882	And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	No
3337	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	Yes
33333	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	No
2507	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	No
5978	So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	No
7348	We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
10548	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	No
19550	And institutions are beginning to function.	No
6315	And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	No
28697	And so I don't support censorship.	No
1963	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
18728	And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	Yes
9593	And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.	No
6793	That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	No
21226	Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	No
25639	"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	No
22334	This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	No
13642	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	No
1591	It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	Yes
23495	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	No
27315	That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	No
20486	I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.	No
9323	How much did you cut them by, then?	No
27604	And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	No
7940	That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	No
19238	But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.	No
10350	I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	Yes
15353	Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	No
11057	It has not worked for America.	No
16385	Thank you, and God bless you.	No
32137	It's nice to -- one on three.	No
14218	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	Yes
17304	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	No
15786	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	No
1378	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	Yes
15239	With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.	Yes
527	Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	No
17036	The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	No
2223	But people make their own choice.	No
16868	My average in two years is twenty-six.	Yes
10825	So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	No
19848	I've supported all the education programs.	Yes
1247	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	No
5987	Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	No
928	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	No
24642	2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	No
8218	I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	No
33346	We have 11 million undocumented people.	Yes
14815	America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	No
26355	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	No
187	So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	No
21099	There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.	Yes
19110	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	No
14760	Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?	No
23642	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	No
17124	And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	No
3280	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	Yes
3153	I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
2425	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	Yes
29598	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	No
11417	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	No
2208	And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.	Yes
342	There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.	Yes
30174	I was against the war.	Yes
29022	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	No
31858	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	No
2700	That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	No
24360	So I would be firm.	No
6755	I think we have to respect that.	No
11208	And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	Yes
28200	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	No
8484	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	No
33216	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	Yes
21046	I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.	No
5945	That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	No
15284	The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	No
25900	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	No
19348	Let's be honest about it.	No
18872	And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	No
2006	It's now four years later.	No
1395	Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	No
12884	And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	No
32752	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	No
12171	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	Yes
6224	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	No
14845	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	No
2231	Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.	Yes
16139	Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	No
1231	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	Yes
15984	I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.	No
3962	You don't say that out loud.	No
2839	I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	No
8975	The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.	Yes
15875	We may think that you deal with them in different ways.	No
23299	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	No
17128	What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	No
23727	Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	No
20566	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
3710	We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.	Yes
24576	We don't have a person to waste in this country.	No
20558	I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	No
16570	I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	No
1333	And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	No
13368	So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.	No
27593	In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	Yes
33669	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	Yes
7849	Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	No
25045	A President must know those things.	No
8575	That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.	Yes
17793	Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	No
6529	It's not working for the American family.	No
25572	A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	No
354	A lot of them are mentally sick.	No
19042	We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	No
28593	But that's the good news.	No
17326	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	No
17374	As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.	No
448	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	No
33841	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	Yes
18455	My opponent just said something amazing.	No
16	I think we've seen a deterioration of values.	No
14929	But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	Yes
18132	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	No
20265	And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.	No
25614	Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	No
17004	It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	No
2384	And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	No
27512	I think they noticed that as well.	No
27693	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	No
21651	The president can't order Congress around.	No
28263	I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	No
33424	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	No
3281	On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	Yes
23590	So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	No
11249	We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	No
14591	We are a rising nation.	Yes
21629	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	Yes
1691	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	No
7850	If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.	No
159	And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	Yes
8917	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	Yes
5507	We ought to put the homeowners first.	No
19955	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	No
27481	And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	No
25944	And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.	Yes
30407	Where did you find this?	No
22202	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	No
7497	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	No
29119	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	No
14046	And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	No
11582	I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	No
24617	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	No
10122	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	No
10885	Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
7792	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	No
8350	And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	No
23963	So that is where my income limit would trigger.	No
34288	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	No
7739	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	No
18814	We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	Yes
33909	I think that's been proven.	No
17175	No one else believes that's the case.	No
11484	Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	No
24750	I'm tired of being told we can't.	No
22457	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	No
14569	And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	Yes
23951	I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	No
16852	What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	No
13818	You've got to free up the private sector.	No
27969	I want to see peace.	No
34334	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	No
16094	And I have made some good sound proposals.	No
8118	If we fail, then freedom fails.	No
26184	You're almost not old enough to remember this.	No
18594	The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	No
111	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	No
33389	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	No
3221	Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	No
14519	That, however, is not my only passion.	No
11419	It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.	No
8076	This is what I deeply believe.	No
22590	He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	Yes
7602	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	Yes
22821	A president's job is to win the peace.	No
12920	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	No
20754	There is a huge difference in this campaign.	No
99	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	No
288	I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	No
7279	I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	Yes
28738	But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.	No
16836	They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	Yes
1070	We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	No
6254	But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	No
19898	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	No
13197	And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	No
2872	After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.	Yes
8504	I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.	Yes
14160	I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.	No
32497	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	No
7338	This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	Yes
8545	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	No
8451	My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	No
22131	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	No
8976	It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	Yes
18723	Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	Yes
14603	We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	Yes
11846	We've got one in Texas.	No
14188	That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	No
12655	He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.	No
24768	So we don't have the best.	No
1523	They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	No
13011	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	Yes
3523	The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	No
9482	I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	No
8797	As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	Yes
1064	I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	No
12905	He says that he voted for the resolution.	Yes
14470	Now, in 1984 they were told.	No
20960	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	No
14477	I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.	No
31867	You say who's making these deals?	No
24771	Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	No
32559	She talks about health care.	No
26390	We're going to do that with an economic package.	No
24361	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	No
30231	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
17657	We didn't think that was right.	No
4197	It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	No
8279	Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.	No
17570	As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.	No
12446	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	No
15591	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	No
1265	I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	Yes
1518	We are not at war.	No
21488	I get wound up because I feel strongly --	No
285	I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	No
16545	Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	Yes
14931	And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	Yes
11408	One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	No
12395	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	Yes
13608	Do I have 1 minute?	No
17787	I told you never would I do such a thing.	No
23715	There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	No
33404	We either have a border or we don't.	No
19981	This is about getting the economy moving again.	No
8195	We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	Yes
22417	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	No
26362	I only have 30 seconds.	No
14184	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	No
27985	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	No
11710	But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	No
26486	That's just one tiny example.	No
8071	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	No
2001	That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	Yes
24062	He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.	Yes
33662	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	Yes
15018	This has been a very successful effort.	No
24958	This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	No
26323	This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	No
9440	Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	Yes
7675	These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	No
19623	We have to be firm and strong.	No
17520	I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	No
5670	Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.	No
12544	And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	No
6742	I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.	No
18495	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	No
8027	I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	No
26012	I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	No
32040	... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	Yes
29848	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	No
22434	If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.	No
28758	Tell you what I hear.	No
29313	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	Yes
2506	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	No
26082	I met that woman again.	No
14410	The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.	No
6994	I will not privatize it.	No
21213	And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	No
31979	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	No
19956	Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	No
11666	But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.	No
2909	In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	Yes
33860	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	No
17652	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	Yes
29677	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	Yes
16810	And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	Yes
14691	Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.	Yes
17424	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	No
7860	In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	No
10857	The bad news is we lost.	No
29514	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	No
32076	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	No
26079	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	No
6660	What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.	No
1532	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	No
24201	Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	No
30441	Well, I support our democracy.	No
21860	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	Yes
27995	I'm convinced we'll do it.	No
26538	We need to deal with managed care.	No
24912	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	No
6949	That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	Yes
15199	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	No
3544	It's completely out of control.	No
582	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.	No
8937	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	Yes
29933	Well, just listen to what you heard.	No
23123	I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	No
1213	For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	Yes
33810	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	No
8905	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	No
3567	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	No
15276	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	Yes
22157	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	No
19193	So some may be better off.	No
19188	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
15364	I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.	No
13292	Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
3684	There are some things that I think have to be done.	No
8952	And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	Yes
19152	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	Yes
389	But governors are ready; mayors are ready.	No
5535	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	No
7804	We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	No
509	We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	Yes
1995	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	No
28843	You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	No
24331	We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	No
8960	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	No
10271	The problem is they'll be in china.	No
8068	It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	No
15852	But he's in the arena.	No
16554	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	Yes
15767	The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	No
13358	Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	Yes
1581	And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	Yes
18805	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	No
3657	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	No
22120	The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	Yes
2191	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	Yes
12376	Well, we all make mistakes.	No
12908	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	Yes
22779	And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	No
4284	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	No
8607	In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.	Yes
19700	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	Yes
14154	It wasn't failing to serve.	No
8942	Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.	No
11993	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	No
17395	And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	Yes
23693	I did the right decision.	No
18816	We will commit more over time to help.	No
26417	We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.	Yes
22564	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	Yes
17602	All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	Yes
4091	We do need tougher sanctions.	No
13912	We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	No
22489	That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	Yes
30210	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	Yes
29385	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	No
12727	The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	No
21251	I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.	No
32784	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	No
34004	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	No
9909	He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.	No
1208	The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	Yes
30389	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	No
15668	But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	No
23431	It's good for small businesses, good for owners.	No
9717	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	No
16684	I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	Yes
13364	I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	No
7153	I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	No
8153	And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	No
17464	It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	Yes
3074	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	Yes
28859	If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.	Yes
21974	When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	No
15268	And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	No
13188	My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	No
10950	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	No
21885	And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	No
18506	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	No
23970	In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	No
12724	There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.	No
10363	The president said he would.	No
25013	So, I can say there are a great many interests.	No
13259	What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.	No
120	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	No
25590	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	No
12650	Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	No
23609	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	No
21609	And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	No
21810	So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	No
11209	So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	No
16974	Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	No
9515	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	Yes
19783	That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	No
945	The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	No
18002	I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	No
5549	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	No
28987	And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	Yes
17830	No, I might as well just go with -- --	No
22296	I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	No
11660	We have to work with Nigeria.	No
2075	And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	No
6897	It's not a government plan.	No
26622	Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	Yes
16763	Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	No
24259	So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	No
22435	If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	No
23308	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	No
12032	like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	No
17529	And I don't agree with it.	No
28948	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	Yes
19501	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	No
18770	And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	No
17039	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	No
2819	Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	Yes
21259	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	No
19305	In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.	Yes
19828	I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	No
18336	What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	No
9183	Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	No
20324	No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	No
14914	The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	No
10158	For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	No
11034	And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	Yes
33371	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	No
14711	More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	Yes
5558	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	No
15304	As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.	No
16792	"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	No
24502	But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	No
26915	And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	No
2497	It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	Yes
13669	Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	Yes
20071	I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	No
16740	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	Yes
21959	But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	No
6723	As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	No
6950	Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	No
19559	And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	No
914	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	No
33193	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	No
24143	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	No
16888	We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	Yes
17700	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	No
25774	You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.	No
23226	He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
31	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	No
18550	Now that's what we have to do.	No
19553	But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	No
19117	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	No
25401	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	No
12704	They have to include the other countries of Latin America.	No
9019	But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	No
17483	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	No
8084	It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	No
27554	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	No
12725	I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	No
7932	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	No
16860	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	No
27692	We haven't done that yet.	No
25145	-- me, or your own eyes?''	No
15307	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	No
21252	We're at a fork in the road.	No
4132	And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	No
20115	Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	No
8404	As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	No
7819	Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.	Yes
22422	I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	No
28880	It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.	No
22732	I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	No
9736	You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	No
12741	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	Yes
15147	But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	Yes
738	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	No
18905	Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.	Yes
16769	For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	Yes
2221	I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	No
29377	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	No
6562	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	No
1420	Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	No
13657	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	Yes
20663	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	Yes
19304	The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	No
8446	But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.	No
28255	I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	No
30068	She's been doing it a long time.	No
20012	You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	Yes
8129	I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	Yes
13321	Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	No
15006	But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	No
11111	What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	Yes
16664	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	Yes
27796	I mean that's how our free market works.	No
26077	Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.	No
22804	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	No
19453	It's called the automated check or the instant check.	No
27585	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	Yes
24403	Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	No
7883	Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	No
33029	And you look at our miners.	No
22220	I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.	No
6070	Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.	Yes
1210	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	Yes
19702	We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
21728	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	Yes
22105	NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.	No
19432	This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	No
19483	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	Yes
29740	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	Yes
12965	Why didn't we bring students over here?	No
22034	There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	No
13834	Our government is that point now.	No
27784	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	No
19768	And I don't intend to politicize it.	No
5611	I haven't made a promise about...	No
34140	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	No
12259	The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	Yes
17126	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	No
1809	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	No
963	They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	No
5492	They're hurting, and they're angry.	No
25523	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	Yes
1489	I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	Yes
1303	But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.	No
19590	When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.	No
1389	But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	Yes
9488	Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	No
28972	It's time to have a fresh start.	No
25913	We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.	Yes
7581	Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	No
1253	That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.	Yes
2795	Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	No
7309	And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	Yes
1979	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	No
18562	And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.	No
12523	I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.	No
107	First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	No
19954	It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	No
28651	And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	No
22999	I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	No
24631	First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	No
457	I haven't sorted out the penalties.	No
16358	This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	No
26618	But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.	No
19286	It's a good package, Mr. President.	No
16369	I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	No
6469	Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.	Yes
28543	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	No
18956	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	No
22893	In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	No
22783	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	No
2442	Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.	No
15373	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	No
14464	But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.	No
2074	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	No
27979	I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	No
13495	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	No
7830	But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	No
18731	And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	No
2347	So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	Yes
32045	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	No
21366	If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	No
13085	We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	No
32889	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	No
21937	Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	No
9583	And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	No
11364	It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	No
22130	All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	Yes
18819	I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	No
1577	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	Yes
28323	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	No
32188	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	No
25529	We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	No
889	Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	No
4170	And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.	No
26351	This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	No
25574	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	No
16362	I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	No
28468	I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.	No
7921	It's going to be a test of our strength.	No
4022	"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""	No
20005	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	No
27452	I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	No
8854	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	Yes
25181	"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"	No
8871	Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	Yes
1476	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	No
12553	It can and will grow even more in the next four.	No
6253	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	No
29786	We need to have more second chance programs.	No
7778	The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	Yes
8962	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	Yes
29299	Will they create jobs in America?	No
8143	I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	No
22012	One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	No
27044	That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	No
3224	On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	Yes
22886	It works particularly when we pay our troops well.	No
8721	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	No
12173	So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	No
33282	And I do not believe the government should be making it.	No
11999	I think that measures like these are important.	No
28962	Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?	No
21873	You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.	No
755	Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.	No
24404	And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	No
6960	First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	No
20758	That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.	No
17744	[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	No
22195	The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	No
18675	Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.	Yes
27759	It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
15500	And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	No
26675	It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	No
24415	Use--work internationally to do it.	No
17755	And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	No
18571	But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	No
25892	I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	Yes
19123	America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.	No
15308	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	No
14757	Together we can get anything done.	No
8425	We need higher teachers' salaries.	No
15936	And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	No
32638	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	No
24030	And I don't want to do that.	No
32598	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	Yes
3879	And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	No
6838	Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	Yes
7677	Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.	Yes
7402	I think we've got a lot more work to do.	No
20996	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	Yes
33877	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	No
32183	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	No
16282	Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	No
13772	I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	Yes
22466	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	No
28721	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	No
1115	And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.	No
7475	And some would say maybe me more so than others.	No
19424	But it seems to me the record is clear.	No
4191	They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	No
12926	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	Yes
17575	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	No
12641	There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	Yes
8160	The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	No
3306	I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.	Yes
14511	We've turned the country upside down.	No
32089	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	No
13823	And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	No
12305	But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.	No
29305	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	No
8723	But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	No
16349	Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	No
22018	But that's what the election's about.	No
15283	As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.	Yes
33600	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	No
17019	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	No
27059	We have made sure that they are isolated.	No
24407	American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.	Yes
26645	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	No
29048	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	No
1462	There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	No
13902	In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.	Yes
25235	You must be tough and smart.	No
32046	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	No
20019	And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	No
20592	And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	No
33285	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	No
534	It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	No
28705	I care a lot about this.	No
3631	And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.	Yes
25040	He's 3 years into this administration.	No
2944	And let me cite several examples.	No
21588	I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	No
9217	And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	No
16377	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	Yes
1413	Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.	Yes
25923	A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	No
382	The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	No
24843	Take a look at the Middle East.	No
11530	I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	No
29146	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	No
30410	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	No
23148	That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.	No
1300	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	Yes
11359	I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	No
20350	Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	No
13092	I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	No
8135	These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	No
27900	No, I am not wrong.	No
13312	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	No
23872	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	No
8498	Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.	No
25204	Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	No
16705	I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	Yes
20030	Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	No
21378	Here's some thing that'll help.	No
15097	These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	No
29401	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	No
19418	I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	No
23946	Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.	No
16582	But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	No
32002	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	No
1059	But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	No
7972	In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	Yes
14626	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	No
4323	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	No
26482	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	No
26758	You see it in the church burnings.	No
33761	Let me ask a simple question.	No
3660	Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	No
28886	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	No
10393	That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	No
334	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	No
26389	We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	No
21932	I love my grandchildren --	No
7511	And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	No
6540	We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.	Yes
15908	Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	No
21235	I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	No
17856	The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.	Yes
14189	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	No
8244	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	No
7264	We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.	No
29616	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	Yes
12604	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	Yes
18262	And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.	No
19845	I'd better correct the President.	No
10551	On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	Yes
18966	Russia is a country in transition.	No
22156	And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	No
16670	We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	No
22026	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	No
30088	How do we protect our people?	No
29144	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	No
24282	I have number 1 and 1A.	No
29319	And I have done a lot...	No
25788	Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	No
27972	We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	No
9310	With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	Yes
23145	The federal government is going to run it.	No
25205	Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	No
2964	Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	Yes
15976	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	Yes
24735	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	Yes
27573	But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	No
3300	I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	No
4085	They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	Yes
11309	If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	No
23007	And I accept what the president has said.	No
19201	Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	Yes
22100	Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	Yes
8013	Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.	Yes
26682	There are American jobs that are being lost.	No
19144	I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.	Yes
12316	I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	Yes
16353	But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
12981	And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	No
8034	And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.	Yes
15370	But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	No
8611	The means are at question.	No
25381	Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	No
3766	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	No
4361	And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	No
18445	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	No
34006	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	Yes
32563	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	No
12697	We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.	No
22337	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	No
1267	In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	Yes
25032	And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.	Yes
25110	But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	Yes
14341	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	No
22036	See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.	Yes
14135	I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	No
11478	And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	No
19683	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	Yes
13236	One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	No
23890	I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	No
20161	It's important, it's their future.	No
9730	And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	Yes
8245	I know what it means to be poor.	No
8875	And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	No
17427	I found that was rather difficult to do.	No
23084	I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	Yes
23980	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	No
15407	Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	No
34098	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	No
24699	And just remember this, folks.	No
25591	And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	No
12989	We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	Yes
10092	This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.	No
19121	I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .	No
33307	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	Yes
16864	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	No
13252	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	Yes
1586	We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	Yes
18125	And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	No
26066	It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	No
13664	Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	No
14812	Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	No
25597	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	No
20625	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	No
7520	And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	No
25293	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	No
1730	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	Yes
654	And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.	No
9195	But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	Yes
3030	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	No
18645	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	No
17038	My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	No
27716	And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	Yes
25444	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	Yes
21746	Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	No
29622	Our country has tremendous problems.	No
435	And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
19659	But it will cover preexisting conditions.	Yes
14100	Now give me 1 second...	No
29511	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	Yes
13799	He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.	Yes
13880	I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	No
20563	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	No
9393	I'd get rid of it.	No
20703	We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	No
15391	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	No
20409	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	No
19950	It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	Yes
25955	You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	No
14461	But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	No
17884	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	No
470	Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	No
10267	Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.	Yes
34054	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	No
26191	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	Yes
17644	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	Yes
538	This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	No
18757	And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	Yes
11428	We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.	Yes
1514	We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	Yes
21866	You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.	No
32298	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	No
24318	We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
23708	That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	No
2428	And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.	Yes
3294	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	Yes
1071	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	No
188	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	No
20730	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	No
21094	It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	No
24291	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	No
28252	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	Yes
7084	And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	No
24812	They fought and won World War II.	No
16667	But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	No
18059	I don't believe the United States did that.	No
21151	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	No
1397	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	No
29296	Incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
21557	See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?	No
15176	First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	No
8381	Not reducing the interest -	No
17577	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	No
28741	And that is the current campaign financing system.	No
20010	Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	No
1026	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	No
13844	When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	Yes
6790	"Faith without works is dead. """	No
112	Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	No
5862	We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.	Yes
16839	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	No
33954	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	Yes
16317	I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	No
21674	That's something I know how to do.	No
22087	What do we have to do?	No
29207	It's very important to me.	No
2202	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	Yes
20661	Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.	No
447	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	No
20801	He decides who the right people are.	No
16379	Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	No
16336	And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.	No
32813	She doesn't get it done.	No
15533	And he could do the job.	No
29703	We have to work with the police.	No
23718	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	Yes
5888	If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	No
27741	It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	Yes
20040	And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	No
1844	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	Yes
30056	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	Yes
27599	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	No
19224	But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	No
22140	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	Yes
32239	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	No
29851	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	No
4230	So, this is a very difficult situation.	No
24543	There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	Yes
32628	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	No
11495	He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.	No
9489	He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	No
11677	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	No
8465	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	Yes
3977	So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	No
26527	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	No
12775	I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	No
22414	No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	No
22431	Thank you very, very much.	No
18991	You know my opinion on North Korea.	No
23316	We've got all kinds of giveaways.	No
6659	"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	No
28955	We both made promises in this campaign.	No
2377	Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.	No
13497	We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	No
34445	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	No
8479	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	Yes
26677	They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	No
16994	For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.	No
20	We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	No
19566	That would be my position.	No
180	I want to keep this economic recovery going.	No
34135	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	No
8574	Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.	Yes
33955	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	No
22184	And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	No
3259	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	No
22675	And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	Yes
7834	But I do not expect it to come.	No
8698	In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	Yes
14011	I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.	No
16206	The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	No
12209	I can't emphasize to you how much.	No
27684	And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	No
27825	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	Yes
12081	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	No
31848	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	No
16027	The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	No
6112	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	Yes
19402	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	No
17139	These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	No
16984	There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	No
32074	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	No
26409	Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.	No
14729	We're living in an interconnected world.	No
12454	I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	No
8507	The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	Yes
2219	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	No
8529	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	No
26004	Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	Yes
22	And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.	No
19356	He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.	Yes
13925	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
18417	And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	Yes
19299	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	No
25587	That's key to the strength of our nation.	No
27202	But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	No
1530	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	No
30274	I looked the other night.	No
23370	Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	No
27920	When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.	Yes
28809	So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	No
29266	We invested in a solar company, our country.	Yes
27296	... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	No
28448	We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	No
10829	There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	No
3115	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	No
26936	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	No
23344	We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.	Yes
22793	General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	Yes
7132	It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.	No
8127	I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	Yes
1817	But that -- that is not the case.	No
24021	I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	No
17042	I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	No
13966	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	Yes
12543	It encourages them to begin a war.	No
621	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	No
19618	Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	No
32538	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	Yes
7716	"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	No
25821	So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	No
21500	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	No
32170	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	Yes
15277	So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	No
2439	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	No
7990	Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	Yes
12616	Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	Yes
367	And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	No
22486	This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	Yes
24710	I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	No
16721	There ought to be a standardized design.	No
15434	Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	No
8039	It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	No
18446	I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.	Yes
28220	One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	No
2481	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	No
12106	One, we need more community health centers.	No
15121	And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.	No
19894	Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	No
21367	But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	No
15314	Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.	No
11560	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	No
11335	Wages and incomes have gone down.	Yes
28879	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	No
19192	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	Yes
15396	We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	No
15016	When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	No
18260	You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	No
23135	He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.	No
17188	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	No
18332	They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	Yes
16167	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	Yes
124	I will say this -	No
6271	Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	Yes
18426	Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	No
20168	I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	No
32776	So I think that could help.	No
8055	I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.	No
3146	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	Yes
19017	My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.	No
12879	This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	No
6666	And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	No
17583	From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	Yes
23933	Decide who you think will do the job.	No
22478	I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.	No
7036	If you're married, you got tax relief.	Yes
23488	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	Yes
23161	Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	No
23679	He shouldn't have made that decision.	No
8993	Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	No
26403	We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	No
29944	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	No
26113	Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	Yes
19551	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	Yes
27233	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	No
26160	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	No
23032	I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	No
20310	If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	Yes
29053	I want to have the military keeping the peace.	No
6629	And that's what I would say to that person.	No
25598	I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	No
23507	Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.	No
22841	We were safer before President Bush came to office.	No
30160	The record does not show that.	Yes
586	But now we have a chance.	No
19054	We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	No
7176	What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	No
21041	It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	Yes
2414	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	No
20001	But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	No
6731	I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.	No
22741	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	No
11808	I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	No
12548	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	Yes
23755	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	No
24194	And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	No
15890	Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	No
24810	And then I think of the older people who are retired.	No
5500	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	Yes
18392	We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.	Yes
22138	I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	No
21508	I want to change the character of the presidency.	No
27673	And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	Yes
3713	We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	No
7422	I think we have to come together and work to change it.	No
3904	We need more troops there.	No
26938	Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	No
32786	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	No
7763	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	Yes
24244	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	No
21844	And my program is this.	No
25119	Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	No
6734	And that's to be honored.	No
25497	And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	No
4028	And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	No
19591	When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	No
11798	We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.	No
21871	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	No
1668	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	Yes
10150	But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.	No
21714	I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	No
2565	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	No
8326	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	Yes
16892	They spend too much money on themselves.	No
15684	The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	No
3243	He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	Yes
1456	We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	Yes
14739	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	No
33092	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	No
2859	The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	No
11553	And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	No
21551	So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.	No
18896	And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	Yes
19971	And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	No
24539	We need a hundred thousand more police on the street.	No
32235	You're going to have plans...	No
27751	We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	No
8755	That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.	Yes
3021	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
8159	And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	No
15180	I am not talking of scrapping.	No
14961	One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	Yes
16380	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	No
546	We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	No
32489	We are going to be thriving again.	No
12995	He's been in some other country.	No
9880	The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.	No
33045	We have to guard our energy companies.	No
2661	This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	No
27538	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
16595	When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	No
18712	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	No
25198	But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	Yes
29279	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	No
7640	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	No
3574	Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	No
15211	We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	Yes
8406	That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.	No
9450	Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.	Yes
21545	So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	No
635	But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.	No
16594	I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	No
11658	Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	No
11331	Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	No
7693	I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	Yes
19734	I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.	Yes
1330	Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	No
16712	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	Yes
15153	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	No
26771	We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	No
30186	And that's exactly what it's done.	No
20066	I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.	No
24287	We've got to make things here.	No
14318	So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	Yes
6744	My opponent was against it.	No
15280	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	Yes
9606	Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.	Yes
22851	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	No
28521	I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	No
22706	"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	No
19915	I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	No
11840	I think these crimes are different.	No
5775	And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	Yes
21444	And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.	No
4042	And when I'm president, I will.	No
6935	They have poor-quality health care.	No
7988	And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	No
26485	And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	Yes
28933	I don't think that's right.	No
1578	As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	Yes
6048	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	Yes
19902	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	No
15413	First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	No
12668	We want freedom to gain.	No
24289	I hope we can talk more about that.	No
24135	With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	Yes
26533	I think that would help.	No
1425	But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	No
20300	There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	No
16496	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	No
25588	A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	No
26396	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	No
17792	So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.	No
32910	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	No
20652	And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	No
25956	And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	Yes
14532	Well, how about this for a government reform policy?	No
12167	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	Yes
1358	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.	No
13729	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	No
1757	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	No
12530	I think there're several reasons.	No
13021	We're on the side of freedom.	No
6531	Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	Yes
3726	That is a multi-year project.	Yes
139	Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	Yes
8524	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	No
11486	I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.	No
6693	If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	Yes
25881	We're down to 336 ships.	Yes
25530	National security and human rights must go together.	No
7661	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	No
11647	But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	No
25791	And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.	No
31955	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	Yes
8821	I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.	No
1018	But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	No
2582	That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	No
23882	I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	No
27840	Let -- let -- let's...	No
34399	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	No
8075	They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	No
16749	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	No
21804	I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.	Yes
2528	That's one way one could do it.	No
12737	If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.	No
6552	It's called bait and switch.	No
8992	But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.	No
3189	The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.	No
17670	And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	No
6372	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	No
18271	And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	No
1510	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	No
16252	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	No
18725	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	No
24737	More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	Yes
30276	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	No
16956	It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	No
12803	I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	No
1935	One, of course, is to raise taxes.	No
22901	Now, forget all this talk about a draft.	No
11173	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	No
767	The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	No
32488	That in itself is a big difference.	No
28226	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	No
23058	"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	No
17653	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	Yes
21616	Help me pass these programs.	No
24619	"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	No
18034	And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	No
27269	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	No
16175	But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.	No
24675	The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	No
23519	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	No
11860	And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	No
19150	The President trusts the government.	No
34055	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	Yes
33378	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
28474	In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.	Yes
17245	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	Yes
13593	The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	Yes
20430	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	No
17885	The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	No
16037	One I don't have a list yet.	No
629	But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	No
11954	I'm not sure where he's coming from.	No
7961	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	No
14468	The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	Yes
14755	You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.	No
1781	Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	Yes
19458	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	Yes
25603	I remember the night before I became Vice President.	No
18190	I'm going to do it in four years.	No
21763	We've got to do something about it.	No
8347	Sometimes my advice has been taken.	No
17322	And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	Yes
13005	It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	No
33693	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	Yes
32442	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	No
28825	I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.	No
29884	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	No
3067	Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	No
10025	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	No
25979	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	Yes
33150	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	No
21085	You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.	No
21598	Everybody's running against the incumbent.	No
13630	I want to do something about that.	No
32342	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	No
2929	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	Yes
26633	And that's the economic package again.	No
2847	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.	Yes
18030	And if we lose our will, we lose.	No
2804	The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.	No
27788	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	No
25070	I'll tell you where we disagree.	No
27455	It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	No
3186	The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	No
18538	"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""	No
8803	we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	Yes
2478	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	No
29687	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	No
18294	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	No
24000	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	No
30039	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	No
17861	By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	Yes
15101	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	No
29701	So we have to do two things, as I said.	No
1086	But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	Yes
19439	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	Yes
22755	But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.	No
9421	It's critical to our future.	No
17327	But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	No
1848	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	No
25586	But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	No
18941	Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
10948	That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.	No
14894	It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
15173	But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	No
26093	Reduce the capital gains rate.	No
6084	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	No
18264	There's a sense of American occupation.	No
1782	And that's exactly what I did.	Yes
18243	We're standing with you strong.	No
28896	No, I'm not proud of that.	No
8374	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	No
7694	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	No
2801	We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	No
2580	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	No
28295	Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.	No
24560	We've turned it into a weakness.	No
8538	The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	No
33854	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	No
3602	But let's go back to the original point.	No
3499	You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	No
25184	Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	No
26286	If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	Yes
18184	I believe in protecting America first.	No
30076	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
2341	You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	No
10188	And so we're matching them up.	No
15046	The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.	No
16546	I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	No
13535	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	No
20242	And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	No
28240	We have huge difference between us on this question.	No
32831	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	No
25227	A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	No
15574	He's broken it three times in the past year already.	Yes
26453	Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	No
17028	It was a superb occasion.	No
32580	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	No
3231	This has not been an ancient history story.	No
3885	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	No
19607	And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.	No
33870	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	Yes
19462	You walk in, you put your little card in there.	No
20509	First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	No
25323	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	No
7461	And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	No
20871	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	No
2564	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	No
1382	And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	No
6032	And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	No
19320	How does he avoid conflict?	No
226	Let me say this about AIDS.	No
27983	I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	No
33622	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	No
23646	Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	No
29058	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	No
15183	That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.	No
26168	I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	No
26455	In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.	Yes
24452	I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	Yes
2218	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	No
11878	Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	No
12961	And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	No
21340	It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.	Yes
16945	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	No
6193	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	No
21365	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	Yes
23860	I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	No
8958	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	No
29954	I don't think you can deny that.	No
26753	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	No
9146	With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.	Yes
30112	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	No
28488	Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	No
12251	We are a big industrial state.	Yes
10474	You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.	Yes
20104	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	Yes
23720	And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.	No
3960	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
7235	And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	No
32623	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	Yes
8169	And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	No
24189	Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.	No
15523	And so I have great confidence in him.	No
1851	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	Yes
14673	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	Yes
4072	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	No
5999	In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.	No
25447	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.	No
34330	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	No
11360	That's what America's all about.	No
4279	I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	Yes
3217	And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	No
18697	Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	No
21346	Our competitors don't do that.	No
10020	I know these folks and I know their families.	No
14289	I happen to think she's a key person.	No
3746	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.	No
10658	I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	No
3967	I can see how tough that terrain is.	No
3586	It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.	No
12060	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	No
3060	In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	No
6060	We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	No
15458	All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.	No
15021	We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.	No
17584	Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	No
17397	All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	Yes
1593	The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	Yes
25390	Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	No
32853	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	No
13950	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	No
4211	"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	No
34410	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	Yes
16199	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	No
34416	Your husband disagrees with you.	No
105	Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	No
8893	I stood there, and I met the people.	No
6206	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	Yes
19211	How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	No
24864	Thank you very, very much.	No
19793	Maybe in your case maybe just two.	No
10760	That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	No
743	As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	Yes
17401	There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.	No
21400	Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.	Yes
18774	Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.	Yes
11082	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	No
9389	I'm all for oil production.	No
33001	Why aren't you putting some money in?	No
13309	Also as far as religion is concerned.	No
24453	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	No
3887	And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	No
5885	Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.	No
34176	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	No
1522	So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
20083	We just see the world in different ways.	No
15384	That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	No
18018	That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.	No
23144	You know what it is?	No
25891	Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.	No
27086	Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	No
12124	So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	No
62	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	No
20793	We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.	No
2232	And private insurers have to make a profit.	No
14301	But look who's around with him there.	No
27393	Now we're changing to one conflict.	Yes
3178	Under this administration that strength has not been realized.	No
34194	If they did it by surprise...	No
17845	"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"	No
4179	I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	No
18513	But I think it's worth it, Jim.	No
13654	I disagree with both of them.	No
29796	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	No
4167	By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	No
7810	This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	No
16800	And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	Yes
17088	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	Yes
17494	It's been a good instinct.	No
26204	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	No
16651	We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.	Yes
33883	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	No
29962	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	No
1793	When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	Yes
33305	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	No
6760	You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.	No
3955	So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	No
27647	And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	Yes
32155	Premiums have gotten too high.	Yes
8485	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	No
25234	But it takes more than that.	No
24242	Give me a chance to do that.	No
8128	I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	No
15649	And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	No
8786	And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	No
17099	And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.	No
7881	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	No
30430	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	No
19276	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	Yes
6333	By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	Yes
13203	Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.	Yes
18104	The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.	Yes
10084	I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	Yes
7278	Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.	No
2092	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	Yes
16621	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	No
8739	all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.	No
23778	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	No
24808	I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	No
2951	If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	No
1969	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	No
13909	Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	No
25368	But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	No
19149	I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	No
26201	As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	No
3668	Look, it's just not true.	No
22998	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	No
23489	The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	Yes
1712	We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.	Yes
14759	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	Yes
3791	I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	No
8690	We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	Yes
16232	I've spelled out my position.	No
19309	I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	Yes
3257	Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.	Yes
10757	That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.	No
6127	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	Yes
14955	I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	Yes
24456	Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption.	Yes
13117	It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	No
8912	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	No
29917	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	No
23979	Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	No
24667	I will have a unique mandate.	No
20070	That's what this race is all about.	No
24008	It's got to be fair.	No
351	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	No
27267	New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	Yes
9290	And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	No
3327	And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	Yes
30312	It is essential that America's word be good.	No
21450	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	Yes
3309	This is uh - what the American people want.	No
683	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	No
25251	And let's talk about people we do control.	No
20616	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	No
21183	I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	No
15925	But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	No
15945	And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided	No
508	Let me just give you one other example.	No
1144	He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	No
15608	(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	No
922	I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.	No
16922	And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	No
7654	That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	Yes
20963	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	No
2452	And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.	No
33167	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	No
22001	So at least we have time to work with it.	No
11891	There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	No
2571	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	No
27628	I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	No
17015	And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	No
7465	When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.	No
9924	No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.	No
11038	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	No
16827	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	No
19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	No
11063	If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	No
33347	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	Yes
17581	And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	Yes
19245	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	No
13308	It must be a test of a man.	No
16491	I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	Yes
9018	And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.	Yes
28874	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	No
19629	In my view, the policy has failed.	No
28772	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	No
24265	These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.	No
19795	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	No
24043	The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	Yes
17797	As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.	No
14247	I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	No
24033	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	No
25459	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	No
10505	Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	No
7458	"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."	No
11246	We tend to be reactive.	No
7872	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	No
23630	I'm trying to decipher that.	No
26660	We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.	Yes
13366	Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	Yes
11227	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	No
24109	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	No
15425	We must have a society that's just and fair.	No
29963	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	No
11618	And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	No
17014	I believe that we can work together.	No
17201	First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	No
19527	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	Yes
2077	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	Yes
22727	Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	No
32627	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	No
1603	We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.	No
926	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	No
15022	Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.	Yes
27122	But look, this has been going on for a year.	Yes
21406	But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	Yes
840	And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	No
16784	And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	Yes
24355	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	No
28186	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	No
12615	By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?	No
16132	It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	No
17617	[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	Yes
32440	But I have no loans with Russia.	Yes
2616	This seems to be a trend.	No
17321	And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	No
26320	We're not going to touch Medicare.	No
14863	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	No
2576	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	No
26416	Let's look at the facts.	No
16689	He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	Yes
18237	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	No
13892	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	Yes
25958	Cocaine use up 160 percent.	Yes
29149	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	No
29250	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	Yes
2241	One last point I want to make.	No
16687	We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.	Yes
13422	The Vice President suggested a number of things.	No
20007	Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	Yes
29051	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	No
24317	We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	No
19272	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	Yes
19215	I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	No
16791	I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.	No
28793	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	No
3077	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	Yes
16690	This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	Yes
10128	But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	No
3869	I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	No
28412	But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	Yes
16659	We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	No
13693	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	Yes
6783	Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	No
25552	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	No
8780	Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	Yes
23986	What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.	No
17608	"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	No
13349	He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	No
23710	That ammo is now being used against our kids.	No
640	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	No
24369	We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	Yes
6952	We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	Yes
10620	The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	Yes
25228	Different people with different views fight with each other.	No
25461	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	No
20488	I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.	No
561	It's not the length of your resume.	No
15713	And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	No
25422	We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	No
9020	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	Yes
2891	I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	No
15963	We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.	No
28459	I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	No
1112	Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	No
16845	DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.	Yes
13404	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	No
20419	It's an issue I know a lot about.	No
25418	Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.	No
3172	We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.	Yes
5891	Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
13427	And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	Yes
22407	May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.	No
31980	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	No
21978	It is because we have not grown.	No
6250	"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health."""	No
1986	It means that Governor Romney...	No
27375	I had the chance to be governor of a state.	No
23852	I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	No
11966	I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	No
33228	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	Yes
14235	I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.	No
22984	It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	Yes
25481	Let's take your warhead principle.	No
25715	What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	No
14332	That gets to the national honor.	No
25374	What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	No
33949	I'm very proud of that.	No
27888	Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.	No
15662	And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	No
2290	Let me give you an example.	No
23439	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	No
13281	Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	Yes
114	It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.	No
8748	Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	No
25074	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	No
26828	I promise you the economy is going to get better.	No
15603	He has raised taxes several times.	Yes
3622	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	Yes
11475	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	Yes
2228	And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	Yes
8280	You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	No
1605	We've been drifting too long.	No
6280	There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	No
26200	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	No
28250	Now, I said there was a contrast.	No
26129	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	Yes
24850	Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.	No
3008	These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	No
21205	I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.	No
10143	We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	Yes
17998	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	No
15606	And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	Yes
23543	I did to because I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.	No
16609	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	Yes
33939	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	No
2897	I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	No
13869	So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.	No
21314	There will be a job-sucking sound going south.	No
23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	No
16713	We need to shift from oil to coal.	No
26981	Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	No
9377	And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	No
20272	He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.	Yes
21327	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	No
1555	"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	No
19820	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	No
33412	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	Yes
16383	We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	No
32647	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	No
25746	There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	No
22268	Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	No
31906	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	No
9573	"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	No
20118	He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	No
5789	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	No
22038	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	No
3430	How's it going to affect my house?	No
27513	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	No
27034	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	No
26057	You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	No
22264	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	No
7090	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	No
1563	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	No
25155	The terrorists have won each time.	No
16642	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	No
310	Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	No
3500	President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.	No
14252	And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	Yes
1734	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	No
15839	And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.	No
8367	The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	No
5899	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	No
15151	Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	Yes
16442	First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.	No
28179	I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	No
21725	We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	No
11827	But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.	No
24670	Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	No
32104	Oh, you didn't delete them?	No
11292	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	No
22163	We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	Yes
9064	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	No
15893	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	No
27580	I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	Yes
27709	In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	Yes
6808	What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	No
24139	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	No
12069	And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	No
19990	But I think there are personal differences.	No
8725	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	Yes
28661	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	No
26777	Now that was quite an admission.	No
22860	I fully understand the threat.	No
6850	Let me give you a prime example.	No
24857	We need to do better in job retraining.	No
15262	And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.	No
26754	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	No
27440	So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	Yes
29535	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	No
20142	Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.	No
10339	I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	No
33446	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	Yes
13476	Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	No
1029	If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	No
33161	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	No
19376	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	No
30256	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	No
10800	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	Yes
2889	Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	No
34345	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	Yes
25414	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	No
9709	I came through small business.	No
32522	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	Yes
33871	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	No
24616	"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	No
5747	Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.	No
8480	It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	No
23549	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	Yes
18848	I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	No
12821	I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	No
32163	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	Yes
30243	It's a good one, though.	No
15692	But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.	No
12742	Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	No
11822	One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	No
29772	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	No
24104	I don't think we need to do it.	No
14429	And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	Yes
16618	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	No
28201	We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	No
8950	But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	Yes
28621	It's not the right thing to do.	No
20644	I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
14449	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	No
15191	It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	No
20723	Why haven't they done it in seven years?	No
15194	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	No
8827	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	Yes
33381	We either have -- and by the way...	No
12873	Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	No
29574	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	No
17977	We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	No
4046	But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	No
565	But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.	No
18581	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	Yes
2406	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	Yes
25596	America is not temporary; we're forever.	No
33458	People are going to come in from Syria.	No
7663	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	No
29020	Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.	No
1710	Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	No
28912	Is the person guilty of the crime?	No
21817	I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	No
24090	I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.	No
10349	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	Yes
18400	It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	No
34165	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
24015	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	Yes
6505	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	No
13274	Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	Yes
17531	The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	No
1663	Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.	Yes
21973	When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	No
14662	And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.	No
6044	We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	No
33040	They'll pay off our national debt.	No
7985	Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	No
15723	Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.	No
165	Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.	No
29376	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	No
3532	And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.	Yes
233	I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.	No
11720	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	No
25714	But that progress is only the beginning.	No
20448	Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	No
25055	That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.	No
24948	What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	No
13811	And all you hear about is how bad things are.	No
617	Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	No
3371	We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	No
7598	No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	No
1720	So all of this is possible.	No
22420	I differ with the 2 here on that.	No
21003	I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.	No
6180	That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	No
1796	Now, that's not my analysis.	No
26964	But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	No
8619	If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	No
6704	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	Yes
28387	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	No
12952	My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	No
34059	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	Yes
28944	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	Yes
21741	Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.	No
19877	You attended a private school for some time in your life.	No
6861	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	Yes
18880	I have no intention of wilting.	No
2655	I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	No
29117	How are we going to do it?	No
1968	When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	Yes
15374	That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	No
31981	But that was something that happened.	No
29620	And it's really a shame.	No
32629	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	No
32841	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
19153	Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.	Yes
20905	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	No
20392	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	Yes
21248	And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.	No
7828	Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	No
32692	And Iran is killing ISIS.	Yes
28885	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	No
3690	We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	No
23950	Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	No
32031	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	No
17724	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	No
9625	But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	No
20293	But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	No
8213	A record is never something to stand on.	No
19217	We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	No
976	And the best America is not behind us.	No
8599	The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.	Yes
29226	We wish you a lot of luck.	No
22124	And only the US could do this.	No
25503	And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	Yes
19777	That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	No
23604	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	No
21925	Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	No
8349	I do not say that I have made the decisions.	No
29488	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	No
25253	I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	No
27777	Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.	No
10841	And we'll get our economy going again.	No
22270	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	No
33595	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	No
21014	We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.	Yes
7948	I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.	No
28512	Soldiers must understand why we're going.	No
10908	I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.	No
19406	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	Yes
16455	Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	Yes
8916	Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.	Yes
14497	We've got to turn this thing around.	No
21653	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	No
15463	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	Yes
21861	Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	Yes
17112	Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	Yes
2517	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	No
19606	Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	Yes
19951	Their budget weakened our support for education.	No
1463	Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	No
17690	One final point if I might.	No
13130	Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	Yes
28453	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	No
29461	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	No
5938	You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.	No
16542	But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.	Yes
29732	And we have to be very strong.	No
21808	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	Yes
14421	Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
16794	Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	Yes
19312	I thought that was wrong.	No
197	But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	No
24676	And they will make those sacrifices.	No
28684	Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	No
2595	We know that the path we're taking is not working.	No
15245	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	Yes
24436	But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	No
29110	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	No
20789	Let me give you some specific examples.	No
7231	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	Yes
33460	They have no idea where they come from.	Yes
24131	I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.	No
21403	I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	No
10821	That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	No
24980	I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.	No
28750	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	Yes
14295	Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	Yes
16718	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	No
7703	We have to practice what we preach.	No
18096	As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	Yes
27274	That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	No
7498	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	No
21510	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	No
17208	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	No
2954	And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	No
19447	We need to do this together and we can.	No
10986	But it is certainly my responsibility.	No
5908	It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	No
96	Panama is a friendly country.	No
5557	In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	Yes
13010	But let's look at it.	No
8308	We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
29116	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	No
8879	In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	No
26932	But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	No
11356	I know what it's like in dark times.	No
32566	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	No
7719	Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	No
24509	And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	No
19834	Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.	No
30212	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	Yes
3091	But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	No
26239	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	No
17524	There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	Yes
9050	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	No
28471	I've worked on that long and hard.	No
26458	I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	No
21123	That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	Yes
29658	I built an unbelievable company.	No
19634	When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.	Yes
5769	That, to me, was so hurtful.	No
13952	When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.	No
26627	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	Yes
5838	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	No
15892	And I said, what can we do about it.	No
16564	So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	No
15934	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	No
19891	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	No
27394	Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	No
23788	The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	No
28734	We've got to change it.	No
5588	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	Yes
15928	And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	No
20955	You can see it in this campaign.	No
32514	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	No
29278	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	Yes
34147	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	No
32690	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	Yes
23204	We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	Yes
14173	I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	No
31933	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	No
24792	We just have a bad system.	No
21164	You may want to focus on scandal.	No
1190	Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	No
7042	And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	Yes
18215	And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	No
5807	Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	No
28520	The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.	No
3818	We hadn't caught bin Laden.	Yes
26015	Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	No
19930	Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	No
10917	And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.	No
33524	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	No
6306	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	Yes
20064	I have relatives on Medicare.	No
24952	Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.	No
3265	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	No
15096	And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	No
23525	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	No
22627	That's why he called him a grave threat.	No
2714	Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.	No
23413	Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.	Yes
16636	And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	No
15114	And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	Yes
2505	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	Yes
23863	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	Yes
14032	And it goes on and on.	No
2703	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	No
3457	But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	Yes
6981	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	Yes
16622	I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	Yes
19707	Did we inflict any damage?	No
13363	Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	Yes
19665	Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.	No
19816	So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	No
26120	We've got this country going in the right direction.	No
29104	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	No
13421	But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	No
3763	There's no doubt itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna affect our budgets.	No
8490	I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	No
18588	He is the leader of that country.	No
33644	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	Yes
32276	But the name is there.	No
8760	But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	Yes
27489	Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	No
26033	Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	Yes
22049	They just write a note for the interest.	No
13196	The road to war is always paved with good intentions.	No
19861	And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.	Yes
1932	And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.	Yes
18623	Never wanted to commit troops.	No
20638	I would be guarded in my approach.	No
22161	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	No
10187	And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	No
14636	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	No
7196	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	Yes
16885	For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	No
32968	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	No
23894	So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	No
28132	Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	Yes
25833	But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	Yes
31944	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	No
15521	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	Yes
15450	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	No
1873	But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.	Yes
11664	I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.	No
22244	Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	No
15059	There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	No
20641	The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	No
7435	But Washington is a tough town.	No
17800	Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	Yes
678	And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.	No
29573	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	No
17360	They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.	No
15072	In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	Yes
28082	They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	Yes
29274	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	Yes
21023	I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.	No
3113	I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	No
10571	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	No
19277	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	No
18365	And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	No
16504	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	Yes
16064	And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	No
25297	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	No
11050	We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	Yes
3207	So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	No
3994	And we've got a choice.	No
839	And I believe that he will be outstanding.	No
25156	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	Yes
25008	Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	No
32645	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	No
15532	The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	No
13646	You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	No
4153	We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	Yes
22858	He was deceiving the inspectors.	Yes
12818	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	No
25298	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	No
8493	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	No
28784	That's the best way to get people back in the system.	No
8949	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	Yes
13461	And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	No
7922	And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	No
7771	A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	Yes
11768	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	No
26249	I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.	No
14480	The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	No
23235	I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	No
21179	People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.	No
19664	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	No
14940	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.	Yes
8964	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	Yes
27118	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	No
20838	They went to Austin High School.	No
9191	And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	No
6870	He has no record on reforming of health care.	Yes
10930	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	Yes
7903	The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.	No
13456	I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	No
13428	This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	Yes
15793	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	No
8148	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	No
15247	But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	Yes
11708	That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.	Yes
11913	I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	No
12364	We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	No
20202	I have questioned his proposals.	No
27386	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	Yes
22772	I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	No
5617	And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	Yes
16278	I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.	No
12916	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	No
23716	And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	No
16446	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	No
24241	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	Yes
26616	So we need to preserve the system.	No
12794	So one more effort should be made.	No
9650	You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	No
29537	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	No
30342	And it's a big problem.	No
27789	And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	No
16901	Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	No
7784	This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	No
32891	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	No
9887	Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	No
13542	In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	No
21901	If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	No
18987	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	No
18219	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	No
8449	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	Yes
13619	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	Yes
27592	In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	Yes
20573	He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	No
13658	And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	Yes
14419	In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	Yes
13239	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	No
12986	And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	No
28646	I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.	No
8491	Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	No
8702	their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	Yes
9328	There were a whole bunch of oil companies.	No
18789	And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	No
26231	To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	No
27171	But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	No
768	But the point is sometimes the action-	No
29320	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	Yes
9045	We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	No
18787	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	No
25807	In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	No
25	We have to change this whole culture.	No
19046	We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.	No
18810	It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	Yes
22345	I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	No
605	I can tell him some I'm against.	No
22389	I can think of many.	No
153	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	No
12700	Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	No
545	We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.	Yes
10985	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	No
27678	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	No
20255	That's not what I think.	No
16009	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	No
23614	But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	No
17505	And it's not that simple, either.	No
29930	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	No
26353	And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	Yes
2841	I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	No
27797	But I've made a different bet on American workers.	No
12969	It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.	Yes
14148	He got a notice or he didn't.	No
26797	It's not about President Clinton.	No
11118	Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.	No
3158	We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	Yes
28601	I want to change those provisions.	No
20993	On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	No
15110	And we've been guilty of that.	No
17594	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	No
4249	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	No
17802	Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	Yes
26643	people get so tired of politics.	No
17813	This administration seems to run that every morning.	No
16449	There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	No
34457	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	No
24127	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	Yes
22889	We don't need mass armies anymore.	No
27665	No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	Yes
5494	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	No
11649	But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	No
16603	Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.	No
8375	And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	Yes
4025	I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.	No
17988	Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.	Yes
16821	Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
2146	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	No
34404	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	No
20062	I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	No
17118	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	No
13397	It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.	No
920	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	No
20768	Let me tell you what the facts are.	No
20836	That's my vision for public education all around America.	No
16302	Who's been managing this system?	No
16289	That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	No
29263	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	No
22181	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	No
18218	America needed to be safe.	No
7150	Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	No
22924	Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	No
29411	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	No
6669	This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.	Yes
14938	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	No
1126	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	No
18655	That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	Yes
633	As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	No
14895	In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	Yes
8086	They do stand for something.	No
23709	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	Yes
2586	And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	No
33793	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	Yes
29599	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	No
473	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	No
26061	You can be on welfare.	No
26689	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	Yes
15298	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	No
5768	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	Yes
33594	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	No
6357	But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	Yes
34428	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	No
12368	It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.	No
8181	We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	Yes
3587	I have fought against it my career.	No
28639	Every day is earth day if you own the land.	No
6316	It's not going to happen on its own.	No
23870	Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	No
26350	Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.	No
8711	And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.	No
24934	But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	Yes
28139	And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	Yes
1511	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	No
31937	We have seen him insult women.	Yes
14771	To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	No
6758	I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
19442	And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
20851	What I care about is children.	No
23101	And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	No
26678	And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	No
17601	With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.	No
3100	But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	No
4231	We want to work with the Russians.	No
7519	In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	No
19235	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	Yes
22694	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	No
16640	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	Yes
20600	Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	No
25190	Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	No
29304	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	No
25565	But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.	Yes
24284	Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	No
8122	I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.	No
19801	And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.	No
26630	Did you say you're unemployed?	No
9661	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	No
17761	Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	No
29653	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	No
2380	And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	Yes
33911	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	No
2748	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	No
3687	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	Yes
25557	Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	No
34243	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	No
27783	And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	No
2810	Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.	Yes
19398	And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.	No
7526	And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	No
8220	They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	No
22823	Didn't bring in enough nation.	No
17017	On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.	No
17591	The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	No
27955	I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	No
1547	We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.	No
12442	Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.	No
13668	But look what's happened to the middle class.	No
23113	You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.	Yes
28333	There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	No
1165	At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	No
19486	Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.	Yes
22868	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	Yes
22263	Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	No
18717	But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	No
15026	It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.	No
9454	No tax on your savings.	No
19463	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	No
12710	We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	No
1580	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	Yes
17108	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	Yes
7782	We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.	Yes
15683	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	No
23684	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	No
15512	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	No
16710	When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
21717	I am not for national registration of firearms.	Yes
386	I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.	No
11889	And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	No
20090	President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.	Yes
9739	He didn't call for self-deportation.	No
23037	There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	No
22008	It's still the most respected credit.	No
4307	But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	Yes
18193	I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	No
20631	That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	No
19949	It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.	Yes
25325	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	No
17480	I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	No
17354	And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	No
784	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	No
6661	Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.	No
27917	I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	No
58	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
12835	If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	No
11957	I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
18985	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	No
12332	And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	No
19140	We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
24169	This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	Yes
28865	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	No
7833	So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	No
17222	The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	Yes
9652	In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	Yes
19199	That's what America is all about.	No
30265	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	No
2422	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	Yes
13012	There are only three left.	Yes
25762	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	No
8115	But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	No
20334	If I could respond to that.	No
30053	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	No
28631	The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	No
881	And I'm very very proud of that choice.	No
19807	But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	No
12258	I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	No
17968	I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	No
24985	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	No
15328	Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	No
19474	You talk about the Brady Bill.	No
24626	Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	No
22773	And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	No
2820	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
24332	There's no question about that.	No
3020	And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	No
27263	And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
2364	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	No
25292	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	No
21418	The dollar's gone through the floor.	No
26963	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	Yes
5708	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	No
33831	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	Yes
23610	I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.	No
19844	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	Yes
3188	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	Yes
2812	I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.	No
27166	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	No
32116	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	No
15637	And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
23153	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	No
542	But here's the point he misses.	No
11032	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	No
3096	The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	Yes
28553	But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	No
11650	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	No
10563	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	Yes
18013	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	No
11013	And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	No
13362	We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.	Yes
6673	They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	No
27404	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	Yes
5501	Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	No
20376	It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	No
32543	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	No
17209	I don't want to hear them.	No
12798	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	No
239	But we got to have a knowledge base.	No
13134	The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	Yes
18901	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	No
24704	When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	No
3105	He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
23098	He wanted to give people rights.	No
32877	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	Yes
27916	That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	No
3700	We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	No
491	I think it is good.	No
32589	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	No
9468	It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.	No
33804	Take a look at the migration.	No
25854	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	Yes
30184	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	No
8237	Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	No
19587	We have to be able to make a difference.	No
22476	Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	No
437	Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	No
23962	Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.	Yes
4031	She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.	No
34281	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	No
2013	That doesn't get the job done.	No
19733	I want to be very serious.	No
7083	There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	No
8535	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	No
14841	It would be neat and plausible and wrong.	No
27904	People will look it up.	No
28190	We share a common border with another nation.	No
28662	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	No
23282	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	No
25042	I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.	No
5790	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	No
13431	The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	Yes
21227	I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	No
16926	And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	No
8119	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	No
3551	I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	Yes
22206	So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	No
6574	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	Yes
8494	Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.	No
25551	And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	No
33633	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	No
20113	And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
26825	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	No
12833	Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	No
22301	So I think it's worth a shot.	No
1345	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	No
8321	I think this is the wrong direction.	No
2096	But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	No
19537	So we need more protection from America.	No
23174	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	No
13006	It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	No
33064	We've got to remain energy-independent.	No
3580	But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.	No
20112	But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	No
19451	But I've got a better idea.	No
6526	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	No
12872	If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	No
13807	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	No
13270	U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	No
25195	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	Yes
9022	But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.	No
7690	Secondly, as an executive leader.	No
16168	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	No
2557	We use something called Race to the Top.	No
29955	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	Yes
19715	The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	Yes
2526	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.	No
21706	In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	Yes
21765	And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	No
26202	Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.	No
34362	It may be because of our experiences.	No
10523	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	Yes
9194	If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.	Yes
7531	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	No
18256	When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.	No
5634	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	No
3628	Well, let me just make a couple of points.	No
22721	We're going to train troops, and we are.	No
2211	So that's -- that's number one.	No
13944	Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	No
20473	And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	No
29729	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	Yes
1484	Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	No
23830	But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	No
28345	And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.	No
32380	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	Yes
11970	Well, I have no idea.	No
22092	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	No
25199	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	No
14610	So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	No
4060	Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	No
14176	There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	Yes
14736	Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	No
19985	I think the government can do better.	No
7999	Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	No
31840	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	No
19237	And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	No
16271	That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	No
34182	This is what we have to do.	No
15687	We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	No
6736	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	No
20094	So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.	No
25526	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	Yes
19893	You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	No
27984	I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.	No
19626	We have not been firm and strong.	No
25382	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	No
1401	He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.	Yes
12768	I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	No
15024	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	Yes
18533	I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	No
11942	I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	No
27115	I don't anticipate that in the future.	No
20227	I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	No
20707	I think that's an important part of leadership.	No
27872	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	No
32810	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	No
27120	And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	No
17290	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	No
20378	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	Yes
16328	Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	No
17020	A president can't be all things to all people.	No
20415	I think that is the wrong choice.	No
7521	And he said this about it.	No
17819	Many people are predicting a recession.	No
14813	Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	No
19275	First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	Yes
15812	Probably never heard of him.	No
450	I do not favor abortion.	No
8393	And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	No
24614	So I think the appeal is yes, we care.	No
6293	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	No
8900	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	Yes
19397	We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	No
7704	We set a very high standard for ourselves.	No
25856	Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	No
6575	He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	Yes
22571	Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
13278	He didn't take that position on Tibet.	Yes
20568	If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.	No
918	I oppose supply management and production controls.	No
19476	And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	Yes
32728	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	No
17751	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	No
6995	I will not cut the benefits.	No
3307	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	No
30011	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	Yes
18235	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	No
10507	The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.	No
21555	I make those charts you see on television.	No
2623	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	No
1508	And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.	No
19982	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	No
17318	And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	No
22089	Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	No
14700	First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	No
19404	But let's look at the overall record.	No
12653	They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.	Yes
6290	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	No
3076	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	Yes
13634	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	No
1823	There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	Yes
7050	It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.	No
26510	And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	Yes
32518	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	No
1853	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	No
11037	And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	No
28162	That is a national outrage.	No
16345	And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	Yes
14837	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	No
29852	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	No
33095	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	No
19804	I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	No
32405	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	No
12462	Jim, thank you very much.	No
14614	I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	No
20109	I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.	Yes
5511	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	No
33094	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	No
18451	We need to deny them the safe havens.	No
6140	I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	No
16253	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	No
15639	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	No
17966	And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	No
24691	Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	No
17035	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	No
3445	And I do have a sad note tonight.	No
18883	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	No
15066	Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	No
27827	Governor Romney, you did not...	No
15517	He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	Yes
30010	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
19124	Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	No
7256	My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.	No
32774	I would go after Baghdadi.	No
13192	That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	Yes
15431	And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	No
6340	It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	No
16273	I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	No
10872	And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.	No
2171	We're going to give a better prescription program.	No
2994	I wouldn't single out just food.	No
2641	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	No
2226	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	No
22369	I hope a lot of --	No
18749	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	Yes
14840	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	No
24333	Our exports are dramatically up.	Yes
23834	I want to bring that change to the American people.	No
21891	That's the way the game's played now.	No
19870	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	No
32503	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	No
7800	Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	No
13405	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	No
20677	The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	No
116	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	Yes
20904	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	No
3943	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	Yes
13594	Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	No
5897	It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	No
12066	But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	No
3914	But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	No
2868	I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	No
10678	We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.	No
3909	This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	No
499	The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.	No
3615	But, again, I want to return.	No
32175	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	No
20084	And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	No
7669	Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	No
20133	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	No
13400	So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	No
13143	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	No
15242	Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	Yes
21614	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	No
25877	We used to have 18.	Yes
8968	And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	No
33251	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	No
24846	And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	Yes
8530	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	No
23637	I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	No
21116	Let me tell you what your plan is.	No
14466	Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	No
14767	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	No
21231	It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.	No
21507	I'm not interested in his character.	No
28317	The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.	Yes
6856	The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	Yes
2349	It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	Yes
25629	And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	No
46	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
32596	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	Yes
22373	Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	No
14690	Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
16617	But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.	Yes
22304	School choice -- public, private or religious.	No
23746	But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	No
26071	It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.	Yes
20201	I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.	No
11726	And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	No
7709	Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	No
34297	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	Yes
29792	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	Yes
11047	So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	No
29990	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	Yes
434	The question is who makes the decision.	No
23395	You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	No
7101	Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.	Yes
15634	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	No
29800	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	No
8664	Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	Yes
1717	I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.	No
18877	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	No
2329	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	No
6461	The measurement is not: Are we safer?	No
22556	Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	Yes
16157	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	Yes
25874	We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.	No
1298	There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	Yes
6549	That costs the government $7,700 per family.	Yes
15516	He had two terms in the Congress.	No
8351	All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	No
20011	Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	No
26635	Reduce the capital gains rate.	No
22198	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	No
14272	We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	Yes
4188	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	No
13327	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	No
11245	We haven't been doing enough of that.	No
20107	I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.	Yes
12439	Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	No
15285	There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	Yes
7022	Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.	Yes
16895	It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	No
29953	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	Yes
31872	And this is happening on a weekly basis.	No
6053	And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	No
3435	Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.	No
31912	And I was embarrassed by it.	No
1407	I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.	No
8362	There's no certain road to the presidency.	No
3052	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	No
25803	Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	Yes
17896	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	No
21794	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	No
6845	People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	No
13090	I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	No
16123	The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	No
7861	I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.	No
29814	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	No
4149	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	No
16352	And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	No
24038	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	No
393	But that, too, will require some choices.	No
14242	You want to have a new program in this country.	No
16577	And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	No
21376	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	Yes
9242	So here's what I've done since I've been president.	No
5932	She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	No
17490	Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	No
1657	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	No
21264	There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	No
17273	I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	No
19639	Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.	Yes
28878	So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	No
33362	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	No
15310	That is the way it will stay.	No
25984	But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	No
19274	This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	No
26223	But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.	No
1589	Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	No
17352	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	No
33787	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	Yes
21983	It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.	No
11880	We can do better in our public schools.	No
19367	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	Yes
29868	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	No
754	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	No
390	Builders and community leaders are ready.	No
17715	Well, it isn't going to go back up.	No
17238	Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	Yes
3375	It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.	No
969	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	No
950	And then it gets down to a question of values.	No
26401	Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.	No
14255	Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	Yes
1608	And we have not set an example for our own people.	No
856	I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	No
9741	In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	No
9271	Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	Yes
1812	So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	No
1874	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	Yes
30119	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	Yes
11742	I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	No
21939	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	No
17272	First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	No
4360	That is the central issue of our time.	No
13872	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	No
12051	Let me say something about Columbine.	No
8085	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	No
3651	I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	Yes
1544	The American people are healed, are working together.	No
25823	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	No
12769	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	No
16464	We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	Yes
206	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	Yes
10962	He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	No
29225	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	No
7791	And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	Yes
10698	And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	No
26052	And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	No
34392	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	No
13393	I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	No
15398	We're now working on the communications industry.	Yes
32998	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	Yes
1322	But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	No
17406	When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.	Yes
25772	I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	No
28637	And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	No
2051	If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	No
11997	I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	No
9069	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	No
15241	The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	Yes
14676	And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	Yes
25602	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	No
5529	We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	No
23244	Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	Yes
17033	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	No
326	Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	No
19128	And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	No
27250	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	No
25219	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.	Yes
23869	And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	No
28242	I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	No
854	But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	No
14432	And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	No
24207	Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.	No
13993	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	No
24367	Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.	Yes
32803	She called it the gold standard.	Yes
8294	Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	No
25440	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	No
33950	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	Yes
11225	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	No
28038	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	No
6614	Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	No
21362	Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	No
33606	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	No
19415	Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	Yes
32023	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	No
12814	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	Yes
20308	Then you go to your own pharmacy.	No
6719	You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
12308	So long as people have input.	No
18846	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	No
14827	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	Yes
17396	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	Yes
22254	There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	No
28510	It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.	No
19328	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	No
19669	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	Yes
10145	But let me mention another thing.	No
199	But, George, that's no answer.	No
20931	You don't test every year.	No
1788	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	Yes
347	They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	No
19194	They talk about family income being up.	No
728	I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	No
27411	And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	No
1369	I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	No
20489	Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	No
33274	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	Yes
33464	Now we can talk about Putin.	No
24075	I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	No
13595	But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	No
25399	And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.	No
14680	Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	No
956	Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?Ã¢â€°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.	No
32825	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	No
2489	Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.	Yes
28059	It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	No
19948	Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	Yes
11881	We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	No
10851	Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	No
17815	This economy is starting to run downhill.	No
11679	But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	No
7329	If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	No
14916	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	Yes
6368	Well, thank you again, Bob.	No
18273	I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.	No
2898	Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	No
32764	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	Yes
18867	Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	No
17915	The President's record is quite different.	No
13240	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	No
34329	We've become very, very sloppy.	No
13451	And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.	Yes
8887	if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.	No
13229	If you'd pass that message on to him.	No
21592	That happened when I was president.	Yes
9085	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	No
13511	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	No
24997	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	No
23697	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	No
18465	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	No
24480	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	No
7697	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	No
33833	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	Yes
11739	I certainly agree with that.	No
22991	The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	No
28747	Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	No
22752	Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.	No
25123	But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	Yes
27631	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	Yes
18753	The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	Yes
3268	The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	No
18012	We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	No
18920	And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	No
10075	That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.	No
20546	They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	No
14383	They investigated every single one of my children.	Yes
22619	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	No
17992	We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	No
1016	No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	Yes
8428	I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	No
21223	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	No
15489	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	No
4121	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	No
13237	I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.	No
20136	We are better off than we were four years ago.	No
26006	What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.	No
33467	If we got along well, that would be good.	No
10853	But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	No
1427	We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	Yes
21260	You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	No
300	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	No
21042	Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	No
20405	And here is the simple difference.	No
4047	I know what our needs are.	No
2861	And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	No
7846	I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	Yes
12262	I think we need to have clean coal technologies.	No
30075	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	No
20893	Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?	No
22192	So we've got to innovate through school choice.	No
18961	I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	No
31845	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	No
23346	They're not taken care of.	No
19888	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	No
1252	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	Yes
6248	He's health for the mother.	No
30303	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	No
30446	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	No
22708	I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	No
32743	How -- why would these people stay there?	No
5730	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	Yes
8155	I think we can do a better job.	No
18128	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.	Yes
32779	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	No
8307	The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	Yes
28141	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	No
34207	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	No
25689	Sometimes the views have been distorted.	No
8979	And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	Yes
1470	And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	Yes
9522	Getting us to a balanced budget.	No
7729	And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	No
11043	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
10696	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	No
20225	We know how to set agendas.	No
12014	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	Yes
16185	I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	No
27831	I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	Yes
26804	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	No
19860	I have been a strong force for reform.	No
12848	I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	No
3790	On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.	No
33725	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
6200	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	No
19616	I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	Yes
13837	So the General Motors experience is relevant.	No
23150	They create government-sponsored health care.	Yes
29644	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	No
33655	... that's offshore back into the country.	No
33375	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
19882	You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	No
20869	We had a great time.	No
22729	I know how these people think.	No
14576	He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
12043	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	No
18061	And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	Yes
21948	It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	No
7187	Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	No
13504	We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	No
22891	And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	Yes
13719	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	No
33386	I voted for border security, and there are...	Yes
7826	If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	No
17967	But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	No
33591	I want us to do more to help small business.	No
19815	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	Yes
2802	In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	No
19585	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	No
16456	And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	No
1409	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	No
17763	And give us a plan.	No
11323	My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	No
20741	I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	No
24746	And you have to have cost controls, yes.	No
6391	The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
8354	As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.	No
12672	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	No
400	We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	No
28904	Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	No
29939	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	Yes
21336	And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	No
29695	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	Yes
25050	I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	No
5566	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	No
20805	Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	No
1584	Employment ought to be restored to our people.	No
3451	So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	No
375	Mr. Bush talked about values.	No
9295	How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	No
32032	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	Yes
21308	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	No
22918	And they're over there, not over here.	No
22310	Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	No
8436	But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	No
17489	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	No
5826	We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	No
25573	I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	No
18349	Well, there are summits being held.	No
21886	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	No
2445	And there are ways of doing it.	No
8531	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	No
6240	"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	No
29440	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	Yes
33399	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	Yes
16619	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	Yes
33270	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	No
17176	I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	No
29725	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	Yes
19895	If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	No
17446	Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.	No
18939	I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
27485	And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	No
29657	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	No
14085	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	No
24826	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	No
26722	Let me very briefly give you some examples.	No
9038	And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.	No
28612	I would like our farmers feeding the world.	No
4003	Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	No
17886	Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	No
28946	We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	Yes
23450	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	No
9147	And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	No
26072	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	No
14941	But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	No
6021	Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	Yes
13973	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	No
25509	And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?	Yes
21411	I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.	No
7094	And the take-home pay of the richest .	No
18395	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	No
24022	We simply cannot pull back.	No
3095	Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.	Yes
708	We're not making those choices.	No
13953	And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	Yes
16306	Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	No
27329	The good news is (inaudible).	No
4107	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	No
34338	So we have to use our great people.	No
723	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	No
12822	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	No
6921	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	No
12559	Again we turn to the past.	No
17730	It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.	Yes
12648	And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.	No
24475	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	No
29665	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	No
1021	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	No
149	And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	No
14029	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	No
6590	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	No
28121	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	No
15745	But there are limits to what we can spend.	No
70	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
7905	I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	No
9808	He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	No
14986	You have to see it to believe it.	No
30103	Well, I have to respond.	No
11083	This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	No
14206	Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	No
10390	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	No
17873	I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.	Yes
12983	Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.	No
19482	The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	Yes
1241	It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.	No
34259	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	Yes
9257	But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	No
12636	I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	No
8740	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	No
14583	That's what worries me --	No
28932	I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.	No
16639	And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	Yes
12740	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	No
25609	America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.	No
1426	We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	Yes
4116	There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.	No
3998	And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	Yes
34071	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	No
22110	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	No
11300	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	No
18746	If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	No
4203	You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	No
11489	Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	No
12703	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	No
13701	And I'm going to do that.	No
19624	And I hope that will happen.	No
4238	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	No
14174	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	No
12657	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	No
10159	But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	No
7253	The people I talked to their spirits were high.	No
7863	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	No
7896	I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	No
23602	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	No
4001	That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	No
1422	But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	Yes
27454	You're seeing it right now in the economy.	Yes
15305	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	Yes
23696	I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	No
16912	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	No
23295	That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	Yes
29372	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	No
18008	And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	No
9562	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	Yes
26978	They don't happen to be accurate.	No
7760	But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	No
26371	We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	Yes
16255	"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	No
13488	The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	No
25585	I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	No
33324	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	No
6716	We have more people who qualify.	Yes
29502	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	Yes
7692	The right to vote is basic.	No
19127	But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.	No
20428	Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	Yes
12566	And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	No
21887	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	No
3126	As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	Yes
17859	Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	Yes
9569	If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	Yes
33255	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	Yes
13298	And that's my view now.	No
23243	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	Yes
25167	We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	No
26712	When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.	Yes
8788	So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	No
19116	I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	No
18500	He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.	No
9742	And I think that's a mistake.	No
21633	My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.	Yes
2886	I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	No
7658	I have talked to Negro mothers.	No
6587	I have a manufacturing jobs credit.	No
821	Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	No
1256	We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	Yes
12819	There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	No
29941	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	Yes
28801	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	Yes
25291	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	No
18944	It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	No
30203	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	No
4048	So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	No
20363	The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.	No
5855	And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	No
20784	And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
1997	I have my own plan.	No
6264	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	No
24679	-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	No
17131	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	No
7626	I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	No
2032	Well, we've had this discussion before.	No
3225	South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	No
24354	That was their response to that sort of action.	No
1747	Middle-income families are being crushed.	No
5664	But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.	No
11515	But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.	No
3010	It's a matter of being strong.	No
14476	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	No
20936	Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	No
32286	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	No
20746	Those are very clear differences.	No
18110	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	No
718	I'm not reconsidering my position.	No
13613	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	Yes
10042	I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.	No
30052	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	Yes
121	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	No
16005	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	No
886	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	No
1066	They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	No
24073	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	Yes
19496	You're not going to worry about it anymore.	No
7757	Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	No
339	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	No
19125	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	No
7615	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	No
1412	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	Yes
3011	It's a matter of being consistent.	No
7754	I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.	Yes
1118	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	No
32338	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	No
24103	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	No
1365	Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	Yes
7410	Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.	No
22115	Yes, we got problems at home.	No
22941	Eight countries have left it.	Yes
705	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	Yes
4400	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	No
8807	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	No
32479	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	No
16604	The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	No
5537	And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	No
32989	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	No
19722	I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	No
8525	We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	No
19137	That, to me, is the key.	No
33057	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	Yes
23917	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	No
32739	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	Yes
20571	It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	No
32679	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	Yes
324	I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	No
16944	I would have uh - done it opposite.	No
24963	I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	No
16624	In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	Yes
7068	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	No
241	We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	No
12634	The rest either abstained or voted against us.	Yes
26750	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	No
15776	And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	No
12346	That's an interruption, by the way.	No
7213	You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	No
14703	They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.	No
12298	I think there's a difference.	No
22884	We're not going to have a draft, period.	No
9080	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	No
8727	I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	No
26909	But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.	No
23618	I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	No
28797	Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	No
3831	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	No
18823	And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	No
16090	And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.	No
20237	I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	No
15836	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	No
25813	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	No
23680	And I'll take responsibility for them.	No
21335	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	No
22616	Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.	Yes
32009	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	Yes
18963	I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	No
14738	And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?	No
2573	Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	No
8512	The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.	No
25538	And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.	No
22143	Coming out of World War II it made sense.	No
11850	A jury found them guilty.	Yes
34041	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	No
3302	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	Yes
27241	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	No
11337	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	No
23593	I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	No
13266	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	Yes
18984	Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	No
28439	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	No
19037	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	No
29783	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	No
8578	Not at all Because these are determined men.	No
15448	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	No
30040	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	No
21427	WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deal with our problems, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve our problems.	No
34447	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	Yes
32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	No
6405	It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	No
10767	The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	Yes
7133	And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	No
29887	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	No
21698	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	No
7676	About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	Yes
26507	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	No
22338	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	No
17242	And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	Yes
19340	Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.	Yes
587	I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	No
5998	And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	No
15004	I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.	No
2246	That's -- that's a big topic.	No
2045	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	Yes
10203	When -- when he was asked would class size...	No
25625	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	No
859	I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.	No
32839	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	Yes
12622	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	No
25969	That's what drug it out.	No
28967	You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	Yes
22887	It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	Yes
12932	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	No
29482	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	Yes
26567	And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	No
29204	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	No
15833	And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	No
2532	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	No
22936	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	No
24910	And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	Yes
34185	Chris, we don't gain anything.	No
33308	We have no country if we have no border.	No
15170	There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	Yes
33598	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	No
1205	I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	Yes
26574	But maybe there ought to be more debates.	No
2869	As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.	Yes
6898	The government doesn't require you to do anything.	No
26504	I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	No
15227	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	Yes
29389	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	No
17408	We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	Yes
12210	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	Yes
15627	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	No
142	And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	No
19798	I also want a bridge to the truth.	No
26807	But I would just say this.	No
9034	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	No
10602	But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.	No
19528	But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	Yes
13175	And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	Yes
1032	I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.	No
29781	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	Yes
17224	Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.	No
9279	I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	No
26536	17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
28583	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	Yes
33093	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	No
4172	Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	No
29711	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	No
14057	If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	No
3666	And that's just a fact.	Yes
3704	Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	Yes
27855	This is a company, this isn't basic research.	No
29817	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	No
12115	I think that's the very best way to go.	No
33284	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	Yes
25863	May I ask you a question?	No
17518	Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	No
23053	John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.	No
10916	Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
28112	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	No
27584	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	No
2963	I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	No
17212	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	Yes
14400	Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.	Yes
15372	But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	No
32423	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	No
32584	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
17031	In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	No
8603	Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	No
26588	But these are important questions.	No
26175	My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	No
20206	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	No
18173	And there are a long list of thing.	No
18569	You have to close the borders.	No
10804	He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	Yes
13429	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	No
27248	I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	No
32969	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	No
25034	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	No
30062	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	No
12113	If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	No
7436	And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	No
18765	I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	No
25595	I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	No
11402	Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	No
27254	We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	No
11224	We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	No
8047	I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	No
22955	This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	No
1886	That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	No
23225	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	Yes
33077	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	No
8576	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	Yes
25918	The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	No
19836	There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	Yes
13110	This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.	No
27708	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	Yes
33097	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	No
14727	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	No
30301	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	No
20514	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	No
25077	I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	No
5743	I've got the scars to prove it.	No
33785	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
10766	You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.	Yes
3697	Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.	No
26540	It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	No
25216	"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	Yes
18705	"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."	No
11087	Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
27960	but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	No
23326	It's been there for 20 years.	No
15209	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	Yes
27298	Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	No
30012	I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
7766	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	No
24698	Costs will continue to spiral.	No
6534	223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.	Yes
11055	And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.	Yes
22020	That's what the election's about.	No
12297	That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	No
23867	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	No
7832	I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	No
16254	I think a great many of them have come out today.	No
8843	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	No
30081	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	Yes
1346	of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.	No
2214	They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.	No
25599	And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.	No
3232	Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	Yes
18404	What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	No
25322	And I supported this bill.	Yes
9342	And so what we did was take away those leases.	No
28404	If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.	No
32499	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	Yes
15871	They're not left or right.	No
19781	That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	No
14809	I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	No
15557	More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.	Yes
18261	And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	Yes
22306	Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	No
10543	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	No
17186	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	No
13539	We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.	No
560	Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.	No
682	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.	No
7840	We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.	Yes
16741	These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	No
9403	So I get the last question -- last answer --	No
20060	It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	No
5564	You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	No
30432	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	No
15083	When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	Yes
23127	Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	Yes
29867	Well, I -- I do think...	No
33494	Hillary, you have no idea.	No
6251	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	No
34079	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	No
22861	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	No
24441	I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	Yes
11883	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	No
3256	Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	No
16809	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	Yes
3167	I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	No
23920	So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	No
24841	The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	Yes
3577	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	Yes
20740	I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	No
26911	We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.	Yes
20771	Let me give you one example.	No
14660	The whole world has had economic problems.	No
24588	But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	No
7749	It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	Yes
13803	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	No
10376	And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.	No
17466	So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	No
23416	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	Yes
363	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	No
23117	Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.	Yes
2479	This is the private market.	No
24372	To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	No
2135	My grandfather died a while back.	No
28808	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	No
19994	And not about personal things.	No
24384	They didn't go over to coddle.	No
24212	Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	No
7443	And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.	No
26459	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	No
8189	Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?	No
24309	Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	No
1507	And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	No
33471	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	Yes
26335	Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	Yes
6860	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	Yes
11732	That's what we did in Haiti.	No
15428	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	No
3995	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	No
10569	But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	No
19748	Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	No
28816	Well, you establish respect for differences.	No
16134	So that's not where we ought to go.	No
11171	I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	No
33361	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	Yes
2235	And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	No
34247	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	Yes
6487	I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	No
13018	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	No
266	"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	No
13543	Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.	No
14411	Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	No
26530	A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	No
3536	And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	No
23473	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	Yes
3786	So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	Yes
11078	I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.	No
17279	I have a deep religious faith.	No
17348	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	No
21784	So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	No
11066	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	No
19529	They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.	Yes
21970	Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	Yes
1665	And housing has begun to rise.	Yes
7283	And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	Yes
6732	It's important that we do that.	No
8699	Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	No
16715	We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	No
25870	I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	Yes
18431	We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.	Yes
7110	They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	Yes
8844	I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.	No
33028	But we need much more than wind and solar.	No
23719	Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	No
136	It's not going to cost the government money.	No
9055	That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	No
2991	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	No
14388	So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	No
3808	The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.	No
13849	We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.	Yes
29121	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	No
1458	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	Yes
1245	I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.	No
14066	All these things take a few minutes.	No
24625	We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	No
25426	"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"	No
29611	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	No
12808	But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	No
18964	And so I've told him my opinion.	No
25468	The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	No
19297	I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	No
13460	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	No
716	Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	No
25947	Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	No
29927	But let me just tell you.	No
29799	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	No
620	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	No
8080	Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	No
16691	We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	Yes
11983	Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.	No
22136	We have to have our people at work.	No
14033	And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	No
24264	We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	No
8130	I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	No
20916	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	Yes
15333	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	No
11724	Our military is meant to fight and win war.	No
14646	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	Yes
18236	And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	No
12906	Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	Yes
19412	We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	Yes
27524	Bob, let me just respond.	No
6170	And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	No
8179	Where, then, do we disagree?	No
16394	And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	No
20283	I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	No
10032	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	Yes
11820	That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	No
11543	I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	No
13023	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	No
17447	But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	No
24836	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	No
2371	Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	Yes
11449	That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	No
11919	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	No
9812	It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	Yes
19523	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	Yes
12567	To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	No
29556	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	Yes
1023	These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	No
27505	I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	No
16556	I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	No
22411	I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	No
6018	And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	No
29172	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	No
15581	No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	No
33106	So I consider that a compliment.	No
12240	We have to be bold.	No
31920	We're going to make America safe again.	No
5854	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	No
22964	You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.	No
4372	They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	Yes
24034	Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	No
851	I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	No
17369	The President says it'll disappear automatically.	No
32903	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	No
25480	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	No
5656	I know how to eliminate programs.	No
8618	And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	No
13769	And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	Yes
271	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	No
24968	So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.	No
18015	And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.	No
14653	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	No
11000	Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	Yes
3048	We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	No
13413	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	No
5579	... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	No
22644	He's trying to attack me.	No
15047	But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	No
20148	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	No
14325	We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	Yes
8089	And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	Yes
19185	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	No
16126	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	No
17421	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	No
19827	So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	No
27366	It's not driven by politics.	Yes
24978	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	No
15729	We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	No
15753	And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.	No
8550	Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	Yes
4397	And they know that I'll take care of them.	No
24283	One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	No
7745	That's a test of prestige.	No
8592	Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	No
7971	And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	No
13838	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	No
18362	Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	No
23140	Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.	Yes
17712	The interest rates are based on inflation.	No
6458	Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.	No
19991	I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.	No
6583	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	Yes
8020	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	No
3846	He raised a whole bunch of them.	No
15924	It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	No
2876	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	No
19959	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	No
6197	But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	No
15873	I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	No
6602	And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	No
34170	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	Yes
32477	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	Yes
13716	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	Yes
14273	Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	Yes
13982	This is my point tonight.	No
13256	And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	No
20892	Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	No
16801	This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	No
17805	That's why I want another 4 years.	No
15178	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	Yes
15894	We took the child to New York.	No
27085	We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	No
23247	He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
15555	And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	No
26367	Senator Dole led the opposition to it.	No
23975	I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	Yes
25162	First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.	Yes
953	And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	No
23893	I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	No
15712	We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.	Yes
14954	We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	No
3610	Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.	Yes
4169	We will take a look.	No
26842	This is a real important election.	No
17871	We have 543 at present.	Yes
22905	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	No
24188	Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.	No
26345	We had a better idea.	No
12222	The horse is up here now.	No
10611	I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	No
16707	The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	Yes
27031	...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	No
26465	Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	No
33711	The report was so bad.	No
6085	Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.	No
11294	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	No
513	Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	No
8582	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	No
31982	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	No
25640	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	No
25420	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	No
8899	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	Yes
20981	I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	No
20151	And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.	No
19647	I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	No
34184	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	No
362	We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	No
19808	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	Yes
23929	Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	No
27070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	No
10564	And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	No
14912	At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	Yes
27679	And it's important for them.	No
24747	But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.	Yes
28462	Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	Yes
22885	The all- volunteer army works.	No
27220	We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	No
11152	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	No
16588	When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	Yes
20458	I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	No
17522	That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	No
26642	We took it out of politics.	No
16526	Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	No
29694	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	No
6015	The technology is there and we have to drill now.	No
25197	"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	No
3480	So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.	No
1512	Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	No
24946	And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	Yes
20685	My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	No
21191	You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	No
32804	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	Yes
3242	I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	No
8074	All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.	No
8783	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	Yes
1975	And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	Yes
17011	I owe the special interests nothing.	No
4405	That's where I get my name.	No
28552	I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.	No
2740	But they lead in very different directions.	No
21018	Too many people have been left behind.	No
15770	And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	No
17093	Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	Yes
1430	And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.	No
10735	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	No
12114	And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	Yes
20982	I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.	No
3950	Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	Yes
15369	Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	Yes
28711	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	No
16722	There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.	No
24323	And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	No
22230	The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.	Yes
7914	I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.	No
27084	They're willing to work with us.	Yes
2172	That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.	Yes
27853	This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	No
26050	On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	Yes
17387	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	Yes
19095	Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	Yes
19829	I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	No
27276	We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	No
20852	And so does Michael Feinberg.	No
17747	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	No
23019	And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	No
32171	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	Yes
17593	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	Yes
28713	And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.	No
20823	Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	No
8028	But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.	No
19775	He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.	No
1387	Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	Yes
20969	But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	No
14743	To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.	No
8202	We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	Yes
15657	What was he referring to?	No
5547	He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.	No
23403	Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	No
26195	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.	No
23385	And I just told you the facts, sir.	No
22497	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	No
12390	And so I think this is an issue.	No
8878	That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.	No
29176	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	Yes
18076	I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	No
6039	If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	No
3359	Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?	No
14431	And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.	Yes
8953	And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.	Yes
23554	"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	Yes
16589	And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	Yes
26369	He said it was a mistake.	No
2965	As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	No
2874	Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.	Yes
11926	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	No
19157	We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	Yes
15163	Yes, I'd be glad to.	No
25244	I read his statement the other day.	No
19162	We'll have specific differences later.	No
18737	We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.	Yes
34435	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	No
7943	So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	No
27252	Trade grows about 12 percent year.	Yes
15119	Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	No
2894	What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	No
1570	My own background is different from his.	No
32472	I wish you would have done this.	No
14548	And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	No
24570	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	No
17323	Let's take the example that the President cites.	No
33143	Thank you very much, Chris.	No
16627	If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.	No
1050	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	Yes
26208	Because you got a big tax increase.	Yes
26562	So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	No
1149	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	No
23859	I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.	No
8313	I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.	No
28875	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	No
22809	"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	No
28246	It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.	No
18286	Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	No
8927	So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	No
15240	I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	No
658	We ought to say this is good.	No
11735	That's really about all we can do.	No
21602	Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	Yes
8434	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.	Yes
26766	So we want to end discrimination.	No
25165	On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.	No
16966	It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	No
415	I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.	No
20122	There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	Yes
3569	So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	No
5628	If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	No
13706	Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	Yes
25570	Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	No
25831	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	Yes
19159	I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.	No
14126	You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	No
6795	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	No
23635	It's one way to help reduce abortions.	No
10052	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	No
33022	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	Yes
10516	That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	No
21347	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	No
2337	It wasn't thought through properly.	No
7793	I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	No
26431	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	Yes
426	And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	Yes
17486	Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	No
19499	Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	No
29179	My father was a small-businessman.	No
16208	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	Yes
24634	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	No
25924	When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.	Yes
24835	You have to make tough calls.	No
24607	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	Yes
27492	There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	No
34278	This would take a lot of negotiation.	No
29175	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	No
3638	Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	No
2793	We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	No
28984	Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	Yes
2648	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	Yes
18269	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	No
15772	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	Yes
27104	And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	Yes
22033	Everybody knows how to fix them.	No
15295	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	No
33602	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	Yes
20080	And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	No
161	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	Yes
14656	And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.	No
1881	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
746	We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	No
34414	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	No
33105	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	No
16568	I do not agree with that point of view.	No
7337	This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	Yes
24243	I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	No
7639	This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.	No
244	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	No
12513	I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	No
4357	All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.	No
23977	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	No
352	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	No
16702	I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.	Yes
1770	I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.	No
16558	There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	No
19325	The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	No
16805	This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	Yes
33247	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	No
11329	I came from very modest means.	No
3230	This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	Yes
8593	The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	Yes
24239	I think the American people are ready for action.	No
3648	We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	No
9438	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	Yes
15267	I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	Yes
10144	And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	No
12866	We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	Yes
1599	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	No
4020	"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	No
6114	And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	No
84	And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	No
11770	The governor mentioned it earlier.	No
13325	He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	Yes
24761	He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	Yes
29850	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	No
28134	They discover great new cures and that's great.	No
17199	And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.	Yes
33930	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	Yes
1250	Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	No
8697	And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	Yes
4039	You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.	No
16808	And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.	Yes
23038	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	No
2658	I don't just talk about it.	No
12328	What are we going to tell our children?	No
12562	And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	No
23304	You looked at me like my clock was up.	No
29241	Five million people lost their homes.	Yes
32568	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	No
29275	So I will tell you this.	No
12325	I think that we do.	No
652	Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	No
10763	There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	No
17232	So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	No
19738	The Mideast is very difficult.	No
3431	How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	No
8523	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	No
19646	We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.	No
3261	We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	No
11645	We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	Yes
10792	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	No
2366	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	No
33200	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	Yes
28700	I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	No
823	Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.Ã¢â€°Â¤	Yes
17025	Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	No
15392	I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	No
9645	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	No
1667	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	No
2853	We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.	No
3325	Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	No
21463	But character is an important part of the equation.	No
6803	Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.	No
10266	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	No
14134	So the answer is I could do that.	No
21747	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	No
27230	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	No
26806	Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	No
2296	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	Yes
12868	I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	No
8849	What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?	No
3062	But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	No
32461	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	No
1440	Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	Yes
14587	He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
12472	The warning signs are clear.	No
1766	On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	Yes
18448	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	No
13897	And let me say this.	No
33983	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
27646	We then started to build up Afghan forces.	No
1402	The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	No
7851	One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	No
3046	The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.	No
23048	I wanted to get something done.	No
16405	I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	No
7344	I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	No
28332	So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	No
33886	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	Yes
25226	We have an arms race underway instead.	No
22217	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	No
25284	I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.	No
12637	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	No
34339	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	No
23943	You have questioned my patriotism.	No
1920	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	Yes
12930	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	No
3543	Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	No
33218	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	No
29995	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	No
12642	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	Yes
14981	And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	No
16097	I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	No
1662	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	No
26599	Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	No
21329	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	No
17007	Our economic strength is still there.	No
30085	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	No
946	And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	No
28507	If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	No
34025	I'm not looking at anything now.	No
12630	I don't think they do, enough.	No
1266	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	Yes
6535	All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.	Yes
20517	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	No
6117	Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.	No
12445	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	No
3897	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	Yes
15867	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	No
23424	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	No
19472	And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	No
8808	Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	No
25448	But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.	No
26059	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	No
12123	"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."	Yes
5872	Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	Yes
7946	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	No
13483	I think we have been right in carrying it.	No
12611	Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?	No
15492	But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	No
17867	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	Yes
1973	That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	Yes
25142	I could have gone on forever.	No
34285	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	No
15749	And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	No
17310	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	No
11929	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	No
17120	But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.	Yes
25033	There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	Yes
19518	Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.	Yes
14381	And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.	No
17769	And that's the way it should be.	No
22968	I'm going to change that.	No
25435	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	No
6586	I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	No
5653	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	Yes
14179	But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.	Yes
12891	This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	No
24156	We've given away whole industries.	Yes
23504	This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	No
21148	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	No
29891	She failed to get the birth certificate.	Yes
7194	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	No
155	So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.	No
36	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	No
25828	But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	No
16285	And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	No
33393	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	Yes
25036	I will keep this nation strong.	No
25806	So this is, that's a good start.	No
3373	We can be once again.	No
18437	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	No
21225	There is a huge difference of opinion.	No
9809	He hasn't done that either.	No
1038	At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.	Yes
8197	We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	Yes
13449	They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.	Yes
1585	We've become almost a welfare state.	No
29600	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	Yes
22419	I do not want to raise taxes.	No
2809	And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	No
9053	That we must cut back.	No
24359	The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	Yes
7607	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	Yes
15940	So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	No
32895	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	No
14458	Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	No
7889	I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	No
19517	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	Yes
26773	And we're all proud of it.	No
14177	One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	Yes
793	And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	No
29515	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	Yes
14568	"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	No
17030	In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	No
19419	I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	No
179	One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	No
22483	Our schools are now better.	No
16384	And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.	No
11990	In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	Yes
23976	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	Yes
81	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	Yes
25071	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	Yes
7251	I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	No
23328	He voted 98 times to raise taxes.	Yes
19687	I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	No
10251	The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.	Yes
14401	So I say this is very simple.	No
848	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	No
2025	That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	Yes
21806	Let's start with a premise.	No
13974	Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	No
5718	You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	No
3104	In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.	Yes
20108	The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.	No
20810	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	Yes
21715	I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.	No
34276	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	No
895	But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.	No
14055	But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.	No
22650	Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	No
15200	And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.	No
8215	And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	No
32991	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	No
29548	Let her release the e-mails.	No
24849	And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	No
24633	Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	No
11247	That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.	Yes
3171	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	No
12520	And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	No
23445	Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	Yes
663	And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	No
22246	Now, you're paying for that.	No
14390	I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	No
15670	And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	No
3915	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
23231	One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	Yes
3926	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	Yes
16121	But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	No
12531	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	No
4103	Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	No
12020	He is for registration of guns.	Yes
12041	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	Yes
21840	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	Yes
32193	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	No
18986	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	Yes
19143	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	No
12852	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	No
34064	This is -- this is a mindset.	No
33191	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	No
16407	And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	No
25388	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	No
18968	And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	No
2917	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	No
9453	But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	Yes
28924	Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.	Yes
24018	I have cut defense spending.	Yes
10888	We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.	Yes
19187	Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
14867	I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	Yes
2115	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.	No
19191	For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	Yes
15755	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	No
23351	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	No
27438	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	No
10082	It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	No
24507	So we're still in the fight.	No
33481	It's pretty clear you won't admit...	No
22995	I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	No
32030	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	No
7119	And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	No
25270	This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	No
16381	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	No
25307	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	No
18906	The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	Yes
16865	The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	Yes
13959	And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	No
2201	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	Yes
2630	And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	Yes
16719	But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	No
29150	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	Yes
8399	Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	No
31989	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	No
28492	And that means keeping our military strong.	No
6349	And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	No
795	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	No
1261	Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	No
3356	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	No
30340	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	Yes
3358	Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	No
12247	We have a very different outlook.	No
417	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	No
12839	And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	No
29042	You ain't seen nothing yet.	No
26283	There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	Yes
192	It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.	No
1251	We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.	Yes
29526	I said, do you get audited?	No
7208	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
2509	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	No
20029	But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.	No
22742	Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
32103	And so please, go to...	No
29669	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	No
27795	And, you know, that's -- you're right.	No
11763	I just want to make sure the return is good.	No
3805	And we will come home with victory and with honor.	No
18552	Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	No
24351	I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	No
29742	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	Yes
15258	That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	No
8674	fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	No
8474	In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.	No
9666	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	No
3154	Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	Yes
19090	I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	No
7951	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	No
6013	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	No
1004	Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	No
33754	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	No
7582	As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	No
24058	And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	Yes
17477	I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	No
20262	I take him for his word.	No
24137	But it is a good program.	No
20167	I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	No
29329	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	No
20425	The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	No
3428	And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	No
16662	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	No
2755	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	Yes
19764	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	No
2004	You've been president four years.	No
23298	Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	No
30058	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	No
7077	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	No
9483	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	Yes
19467	They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.	Yes
29734	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	No
6991	We paid down the debt for two years.	Yes
17854	If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.	No
26568	"People say, ""I don't care."	No
12183	I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.	No
26385	The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	Yes
24955	A President must know these things.	No
24447	America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	No
2682	We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	No
33742	I'll be against it when I'm president.	No
16505	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	No
20843	Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	No
19372	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	Yes
6787	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	No
23079	I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.	No
20536	Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.	No
24102	I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	No
14888	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	Yes
3295	Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.	No
19642	So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	No
12711	His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	No
24344	But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	No
7931	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	No
8604	Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	No
33322	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	No
19945	It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
15229	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	No
22424	I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	No
25029	They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	No
10926	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	No
333	I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	No
24325	They don't go to war with each other.	No
32971	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	No
3556	I will make them famous.	No
14586	He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
15834	And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	No
3459	It has to have accountability and oversight.	No
24579	If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	No
3828	But we have to use our military wisely.	No
16389	So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.	No
19253	Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	No
1930	I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.	No
24208	It is the number one culprit.	No
8863	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	Yes
287	I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.	No
6222	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	No
366	But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	No
1876	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	No
28298	And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	Yes
14592	Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	No
16869	But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.	Yes
28807	The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	No
13350	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	No
6932	I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	No
28407	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	No
7805	We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	No
28304	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	No
13663	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	No
26466	That would be my answer to this question.	No
6799	I think it's important to promote a culture of life.	No
474	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	No
16136	There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	No
10175	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	No
10648	And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	Yes
33048	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	No
9703	President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	Yes
32852	This is the only one country he's ever known.	No
23471	I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	No
14970	The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	Yes
19151	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	No
4120	President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	Yes
12141	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	Yes
3496	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	No
8077	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	No
28691	I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.	No
11510	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	No
17853	So far, it is only a beginning.	No
30046	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	No
24240	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	No
16251	(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	No
16916	Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.	Yes
16786	And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	Yes
24029	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	No
28464	Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	No
1344	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	No
7047	We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	Yes
16235	Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.	No
9071	I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	No
17722	But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	Yes
12407	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	Yes
7786	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	No
11193	"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""	No
6472	I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	No
2100	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	No
11877	Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.	No
11090	I've been in them all my life.	No
6304	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	No
261	He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	Yes
20222	Well, we do come from different places.	No
13661	And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	Yes
11685	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	No
8072	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	No
33055	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	Yes
32377	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	No
26576	We can invite all the candidates.	No
2892	I've talked to them and I've listened.	No
6098	Here's your fine -- zero.	No
12397	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	No
25505	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	Yes
19630	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	No
8722	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	Yes
3997	"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	No
24561	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	No
23908	When I make a mistake I'll admit it.	No
3107	Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	No
32944	We are back on the right track.	No
168	Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	No
16629	There's no way to get the answer to a question.	No
16751	In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.	Yes
2759	The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.	No
23241	But let me talk back about where we've been.	No
18205	There's a lot of good people working hard.	No
24320	Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.	Yes
17684	The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	No
10830	"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	No
34451	Our inner cities are a disaster.	No
34355	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	No
7691	There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	Yes
4341	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	No
15177	And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	Yes
30352	But you have to have some basic ability.	No
13851	Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	No
11207	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	No
17745	I'm going to give the President some credit.	No
9246	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	No
2513	I -- I have to respond to that.	No
30390	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	No
21009	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	No
1515	That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	No
22641	He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.	Yes
9560	I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.	No
5889	Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	No
5765	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	No
15321	I'd like to change that.	No
8903	And why have they lost their industry?	No
32913	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	No
23981	I questioned his judgment and his character.	No
613	We're going to have to-the MX.	No
12450	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	No
27997	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	No
9891	People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.	No
29356	Secretary, you have no plan.	No
8601	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	No
16608	Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	Yes
1711	First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	Yes
10499	Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.	Yes
17556	In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	Yes
10716	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	No
9175	I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	No
29373	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
20412	Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	No
26659	But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	No
11994	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	No
25139	I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	Yes
14710	It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.	Yes
17908	And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	No
24168	That is what I want to do.	No
13612	Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.	Yes
9047	And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	No
26174	Of course the president will take credit for that.	No
4377	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	No
34033	I think they're going to see through it.	No
521	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	No
1493	As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	Yes
6464	Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.	Yes
12099	It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	No
13770	And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	Yes
2720	And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	No
34302	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	Yes
32746	... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	Yes
21632	But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	No
11405	I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	No
23070	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	Yes
16807	It shows a lack of leadership.	No
28861	If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	No
16544	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	Yes
7651	And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	Yes
29960	It was very easy to do.	No
24981	But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.	No
21684	And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	No
12841	Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	No
22019	I agree with the governor.	No
1370	But that's as far as I would go with it.	No
26710	This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	No
15152	Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	Yes
19218	It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	No
16516	If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.	Yes
15754	And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	No
19132	It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	No
32017	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	No
3856	You talk about the surge.	No
25263	The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	Yes
8620	And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.	No
6979	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	Yes
18137	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	Yes
8234	It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
11355	My mother basically raised our family.	No
1452	We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	No
28717	But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	No
12518	Who threatens freedom in the world?	No
6849	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	No
13273	It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	No
19970	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	No
24755	Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.	No
18526	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	No
1321	However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.	No
7393	And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	No
24330	There's no question about that.	No
11216	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	No
15766	I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	No
21015	We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.	Yes
8388	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	Yes
16616	Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	Yes
29375	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	No
368	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.	No
1814	I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	No
21319	And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	No
17654	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	No
19520	We just had the election there.	No
23776	Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	Yes
27342	I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	No
8242	I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.	No
259	Well, I don't question his passion.	No
34212	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	No
30244	It well describes the problem.	No
11861	I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	No
15588	No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.	No
6492	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	No
2920	This is a responsibility of the president.	No
33992	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	Yes
15531	I made a good selection.	No
5551	Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	Yes
31904	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	No
18521	And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	No
26001	First of all, there are two different things.	No
27800	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	Yes
25773	We have to respect one another.	No
18101	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	No
8158	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	No
15629	I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.	No
32494	And that's, like, no growth.	No
12230	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	Yes
22084	Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	Yes
23844	And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	No
19791	And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.	No
30419	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	No
25510	It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	No
12940	You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	Yes
9905	And that's what I've done administratively.	No
13442	I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	No
730	That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	Yes
1069	But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.	No
7210	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
10925	It is breaking family budgets.	No
9499	And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	No
2973	And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	No
11365	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	No
8834	We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	No
23414	I have a plan to cover those folks.	Yes
24854	What we need to do is empower people.	No
19094	Four years ago you took me on faith.	No
8209	What's the net result of this?	No
13184	As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	Yes
14127	Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	No
10450	But that's only step one.	No
5530	We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	No
21549	Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	No
4044	You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	No
15055	It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.	No
16443	Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	No
11446	So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	No
7952	In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.	No
20735	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	No
34287	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	No
27028	...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	No
2840	I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.	No
939	I want to keep this expansion going.	No
7467	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	No
899	I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	No
2555	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	No
24274	Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.	No
1520	If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.	No
13930	Let's think it through here.	No
3988	And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	No
14910	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	Yes
17451	And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	Yes
21952	Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	No
16501	As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
12200	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	Yes
1780	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	No
16024	I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	Yes
19785	I am very oriented toward the future.	No
18196	My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	Yes
19409	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	No
16298	An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	No
19481	But let's look at the facts here.	No
21615	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	No
12795	I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	No
8070	The people have to make up their minds.	No
21363	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	Yes
19992	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	No
33702	They're growing at 8 percent.	Yes
10769	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	No
26483	Let me just give you one tiny example.	No
2424	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	Yes
15593	That's not what we are going to do.	No
33892	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	No
27170	But it's an honor that we have it.	No
25062	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	Yes
19556	Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	No
33959	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	No
24649	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	No
12139	It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	No
8864	What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.	No
20067	And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	No
32725	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	Yes
25310	And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	No
16531	Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	No
32762	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	No
6462	The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	No
14754	"The ""we"" is you and me."	No
22314	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.	Yes
16803	There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.	Yes
16303	Why have there been these safety violations?	No
22589	And that sends a confusing signal to people.	No
10171	What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.	No
26116	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	No
12722	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	Yes
22210	Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	No
22108	I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	No
10768	Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	Yes
21782	I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	No
9679	I don't think so, Candy.	No
32211	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	Yes
9509	I want to get America's economy going again.	No
28925	And in some cases may be still at large.	No
31842	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	No
7477	But I can take it.	No
19535	You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.	Yes
26605	I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	No
16799	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	Yes
21417	And what's happened in the meantime?	No
28324	We need to have accountability.	No
24643	But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	No
21398	I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	No
15341	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.	No
29700	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	Yes
20320	And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	No
18914	This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.	No
24116	And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.	No
627	I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.	No
11155	Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	No
8036	But it didn't mean that.	No
18084	As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	No
6346	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	Yes
21774	I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	No
26300	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	Yes
18293	And that's what I did with that vote.	No
1211	I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.	Yes
29	Everybody ought to be in this thing.	No
22361	I don't know -- starting after 4 years.	No
21306	And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.	No
28403	And I want to come back to something I said before.	No
16440	We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	No
1189	I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	No
19826	And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	No
28497	I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	No
24110	And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	No
11857	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	Yes
15405	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	No
7755	They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.	Yes
17216	Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	No
24776	Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	No
28557	There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.	Yes
25847	You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	Yes
15095	And I said, well, yes.	No
3003	We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	No
20348	Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	Yes
14387	And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	Yes
8785	And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	Yes
26084	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	No
27887	The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	No
20819	We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.	No
27374	I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	No
3270	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	Yes
28140	I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.	No
22458	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	No
29408	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	No
18068	My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	Yes
12966	Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	No
12514	There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.	No
21462	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	No
6036	That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	No
17180	Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	Yes
18928	It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	No
24542	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	No
5702	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	Yes
16849	I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	No
12583	Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.	No
14876	But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	No
32379	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	Yes
12138	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	Yes
6926	The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	Yes
13124	"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	Yes
16331	Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.	No
421	No, I don't think there is.	No
14675	So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	No
9473	Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	No
365	And I think the housing community is ready.	No
8502	Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.	No
97	I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	Yes
16506	As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	Yes
16750	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	No
23221	That's the way we leave it.	No
12391	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	No
7513	I ask you for your help.	No
29235	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
11522	I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	No
14037	I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.	No
7864	He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	No
11220	I said before, watch Ukraine.	No
27602	And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	No
968	Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.	No
26521	How many of you like it?	No
14601	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	Yes
879	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	No
24606	So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	No
20037	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	No
12698	By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	Yes
12712	His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	Yes
1209	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	No
15378	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	No
29230	We have to stop them from leaving.	No
26366	The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.	Yes
12515	And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?	No
21771	Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	No
24329	Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.	No
27517	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	No
6493	But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	No
29465	Then you didn't read it.	No
23339	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	Yes
442	I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.	No
3593	I want to cut spending.	No
12012	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	No
13410	He's been traveling in some other country.	No
6908	I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	Yes
24167	There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	Yes
25897	We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	Yes
26629	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	No
21962	I'm glad you clarified it.	No
3033	In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	Yes
16061	I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	No
22584	Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	No
12928	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	Yes
20561	A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	No
686	We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	No
9174	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	No
16194	I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	No
19387	So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	Yes
9918	Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.	No
12811	We ought to make one last effort.	No
28000	I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.	No
27301	First time one state had been number one in all four measures.	Yes
22730	I meet with them all the time.	No
17428	But I finally did it.	No
22762	I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	No
28081	The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.	Yes
8915	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	Yes
13866	They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	No
9026	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	No
17903	And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	No
20333	It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	No
18821	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	Yes
23947	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	No
3902	The question is, was this wise?	No
12612	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	No
13275	Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	No
11288	The tensions will be ratcheted up.	No
884	The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	No
20695	Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	No
8063	"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	No
21593	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	No
19182	Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	Yes
10662	I know how to do that.	No
24775	But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	No
7321	They don't reach those goals.	No
16823	Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.	Yes
22449	I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	No
22269	That's the only way we got him back.	No
18152	First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	Yes
14672	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	No
12607	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	Yes
19580	There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.	Yes
741	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	No
34364	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	No
3191	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	No
2176	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	No
15186	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	No
17371	I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	No
13024	Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	Yes
11815	Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	No
6643	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	Yes
740	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	No
245	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	No
26988	Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	Yes
30442	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	No
21073	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	Yes
33996	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	Yes
21788	If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	No
10718	And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	No
22842	Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.	Yes
26255	We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	No
7418	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	No
21976	What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	No
20091	He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	No
27990	I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	No
19146	I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.	Yes
8689	conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	No
27062	And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	Yes
3068	These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	No
32359	Well, I just want to say...	No
2432	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	Yes
11622	I wouldn't have supported either.	No
21661	These people are hurting in the inner cities.	No
15530	But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	No
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
15910	It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	No
29586	That was more than a mistake.	No
722	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	No
19800	We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	No
19963	They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	No
2301	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	No
6326	Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.	No
32289	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	No
26617	And we need to make it stronger.	No
20539	I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	No
33616	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	Yes
25826	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	No
12728	The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	No
33227	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	No
1441	Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.	Yes
15811	I think of Dr. Fauci.	No
26661	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	No
11326	It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	No
19049	And we'll continue to spread freedom.	No
12098	Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	No
28494	And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	Yes
25340	And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	Yes
26266	You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	No
17484	Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	No
305	I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.	No
23514	But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	No
34096	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	Yes
7837	I'm very familiar with it.	No
10596	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	No
6865	Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	No
15459	I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	Yes
20321	The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	No
20345	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	No
22047	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	No
11762	So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	No
19757	I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.	Yes
33280	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	No
11754	I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	No
27956	And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	Yes
14567	I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
12452	And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	No
20595	As the vice president is.	No
6638	The wages of Americans have gone down.	Yes
9963	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	No
9447	'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.	No
28050	I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	No
2930	The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	Yes
1305	And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	No
15102	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	No
8322	I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	No
28949	Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	Yes
28102	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	No
13884	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	Yes
13351	But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	No
185	And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	No
4108	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	No
32340	How do you do that?	No
10636	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	Yes
20848	Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	No
24785	I make no bones about it.	No
3961	Now, you don't do that.	No
5989	And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	No
27271	But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	Yes
4408	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	No
30421	I was going to say something...	No
11643	I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	No
12010	Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	No
13093	There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	Yes
27812	Nothing could be further from the truth.	No
12939	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
27851	We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	No
26117	I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	No
20342	Let me give you one quick example.	No
27287	And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	No
24847	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	Yes
29224	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	Yes
3085	And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.	No
21561	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	Yes
32723	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	No
28665	I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	No
11896	The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	No
9291	Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	Yes
8956	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	No
19290	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	Yes
26781	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	No
2114	So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	No
26779	It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	No
17786	Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	No
2830	You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.	No
34359	I want to invest in your family.	No
21591	We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.	Yes
3097	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	Yes
12663	The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	No
3227	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	No
7642	We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	No
9713	I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	No
13485	But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	Yes
12526	And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	Yes
1081	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	Yes
10660	My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	No
27922	When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	Yes
23186	Right, thank you for that.	No
29272	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
19158	I guess I rely more on the individual.	No
15706	It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.	No
32594	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	Yes
25242	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	No
700	We know where they're cutting.	No
12600	Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	Yes
31932	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	Yes
33686	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	No
24281	So we have two that I'd put as number one.	No
25638	Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	No
32862	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	No
19293	It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.	Yes
14900	So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	No
6175	"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	No
19345	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	No
25683	I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	No
33951	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	Yes
3667	Again, you can look it up.	No
23063	We're not talking about third-world drugs.	No
2141	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	No
26038	"I knew it wouldn't work."""	No
3069	We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.	Yes
12585	Is our relative strength growing?	No
24072	We're trying to solve it.	No
16998	The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.	No
3478	We haven't seen the language yet.	No
19475	There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	Yes
10037	You know that I mean what I say.	No
20081	The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	No
1348	That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	No
16918	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	Yes
612	And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	No
30035	It is -- it is a huge problem.	No
2065	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	No
1124	I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	No
13724	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	No
13398	Now, what do we do about it?	No
10315	That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	No
1789	And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	Yes
32347	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	Yes
22974	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	No
17173	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	No
2877	Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	No
19104	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	Yes
7841	We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
959	This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.	No
3236	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	No
265	"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	No
1827	That is, I want to bring down rates.	No
6230	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	Yes
32013	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	No
23921	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	No
8934	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	No
25350	But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	Yes
27557	Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	Yes
11079	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	No
937	But there are two main focal points of this election.	No
25970	Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	Yes
27214	So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	No
19957	Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.	No
22948	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	No
18204	And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	No
27799	If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	No
10377	There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	No
7096	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	Yes
31995	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	Yes
33013	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	No
25564	The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	Yes
22642	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	Yes
34205	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	No
2009	If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	Yes
2444	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	No
25126	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	Yes
33750	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	Yes
33648	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	No
5794	Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	Yes
28131	And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.	No
16311	That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	No
10931	So here's what I would do.	No
24685	Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	No
24221	Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	No
13156	It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	No
19250	He doesn't fix it for ten years.	Yes
19181	In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.	Yes
12326	It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	Yes
23655	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	No
23659	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	No
26934	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	Yes
9058	But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	No
21921	But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	No
25009	I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.	No
1170	And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	No
13645	The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	No
15126	And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	No
26128	So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	Yes
14846	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	No
14415	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	Yes
5805	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	Yes
1398	I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	No
24640	The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	No
22493	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	No
8687	But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	No
24900	I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.	No
69	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	No
29746	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	No
12781	And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.	No
19351	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	No
7781	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	Yes
28466	When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.	No
91	And what I'm about to say is unclassified.	No
28308	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	No
20759	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	No
21481	You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --	No
27255	The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	No
30090	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	No
23823	This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	No
23608	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	No
13734	Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	Yes
27478	But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	No
20577	Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	No
29832	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	Yes
299	You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.	No
20154	Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	No
3149	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	No
19130	Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	No
11407	He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	No
10972	And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.	Yes
3208	And I believe that we used our skill.	No
1592	But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	Yes
7973	In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.	Yes
11602	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	No
14031	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	Yes
18240	"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""	Yes
12179	But it's not a statement about his heart.	No
19045	We will continue to stay on the offense.	No
31977	That was locker room talk.	No
22649	I always believed he was a threat.	No
10741	And the last point I just want to make.	No
11561	Now, there's more work to do.	No
14369	I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	No
17178	There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.	No
27080	We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.	No
9010	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	No
4353	We seem to come full circle again.	No
27642	And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	No
24498	Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	Yes
20878	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	No
19926	We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	Yes
16291	Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	No
14898	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	Yes
1839	"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	No
1516	At the present time we're at peace.	No
26338	I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.	No
7606	Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	No
34107	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	No
10915	And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	No
50	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
14082	And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	No
3922	He did not say that.	No
28457	So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	No
29913	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	No
10801	And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	Yes
26209	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	Yes
3616	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	Yes
18188	That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	No
30041	And maybe it's hardly doable.	No
8221	And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	No
8343	I have met with the legislative leaders.	No
298	They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	No
16764	In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	Yes
15600	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	No
32817	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	Yes
30309	Words matter when you run for president.	No
749	We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	No
25380	We'll even give it to you.	No
17202	In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	No
24099	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	Yes
24919	You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.	No
17005	I don't claim to know all the answers.	No
23292	You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.	Yes
22188	And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	Yes
29246	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	Yes
7232	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	No
5543	That's 16 million jobs in America.	Yes
25550	Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	No
10854	I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.	Yes
9865	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	No
1552	We have peace with freedom.	No
3681	We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	No
24470	And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	No
13253	I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	No
2088	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	Yes
26782	And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	No
16675	Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	No
19411	We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	Yes
18338	Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	Yes
27259	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	No
29128	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	Yes
25917	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	No
15659	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	No
10631	And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	No
23521	I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	No
8978	And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	Yes
1219	Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	Yes
3558	Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	No
7296	I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.	No
9761	We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	Yes
16723	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	No
30054	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	Yes
18052	And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	Yes
16343	And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.	No
28165	Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	No
8602	I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.	No
31889	I apologize to my family.	No
32834	Take a look at upstate New York.	No
24657	I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.	No
1431	The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	Yes
24184	You don't have anywhere to sleep.	No
10867	Senator Obama has opposed that.	Yes
1320	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	No
5846	Well, look, Bob, as I said...	No
18745	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	No
14097	There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.	No
24070	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	No
33634	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	Yes
23228	This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	Yes
782	Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	No
923	In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	No
27589	Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	No
7069	After all, I was a border governor for a while.	No
21203	I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	No
12691	Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.	No
1052	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	No
9520	Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	No
29871	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	No
22472	I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.	No
13392	Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	No
28776	There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	No
29036	I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.	No
3379	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	No
13672	I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	No
1093	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	No
21224	It has been a good, lively exchange.	No
6119	And this is your plan, John.	No
27613	You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	No
1302	And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	No
20711	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	No
23171	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	No
29568	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	No
19744	It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.	No
7918	If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	No
662	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	No
10312	I want high wage, high skill jobs.	No
25516	And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	No
12708	Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	No
15636	I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	Yes
18088	He was hoping we'd turn away.	No
7682	Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	No
21699	I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	No
27929	I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	No
33853	"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."	Yes
27292	Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...	No
18578	We have to start to spend the money now.	No
1548	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	No
8967	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	Yes
25053	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	No
12831	Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	No
7652	Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	No
15145	The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	Yes
26922	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	Yes
31962	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	Yes
1099	I don't have a response.	No
19198	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	No
17158	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	Yes
23916	Well, let's admit it then.	No
14596	"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."	No
28262	I strongly believe in local control of schools.	No
13526	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	Yes
26955	And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.	No
1999	But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.	No
30194	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	No
29528	And in a way, I should be complaining.	No
24046	They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	No
24653	This is a matter of life and death.	No
8894	And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.	No
23923	I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.	No
1560	The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	No
11238	Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	No
440	No other state programs do that.	Yes
14413	Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.	No
158	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	No
17571	I don't think we can do that for a few years.	No
12628	Do people want to be identified with us?	No
24532	I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	No
1418	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	No
11821	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	No
27280	And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	No
18302	And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.	Yes
21394	So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	No
17590	Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	No
13127	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	No
896	But you talk about judgment.	No
21013	And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	No
1175	I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	No
19645	Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	No
27818	My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	No
6550	If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	No
32818	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	Yes
21550	I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	No
21383	And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	No
12998	America has not been standing still.	No
13958	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	No
11131	We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	No
28469	In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
2161	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	Yes
15168	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
27097	We are playing the leadership role.	No
8257	Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	No
6972	And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.	No
12221	And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	No
20296	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	No
18187	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	No
21029	They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	No
11772	It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	No
8970	Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	No
22116	And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	No
2247	Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	No
27198	They don't vote for war.	No
24280	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	No
18715	I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	No
16638	Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	Yes
8810	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	No
23643	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	No
7873	If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	Yes
8670	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	Yes
9797	The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.	Yes
21697	Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	Yes
17130	Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	No
11835	And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.	No
5850	I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	No
12252	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	Yes
209	That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.	No
6379	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	No
24044	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	No
21876	A senator runs every 6 years.	No
20737	I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.	No
2792	Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	No
25231	"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control."	Yes
15625	Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	Yes
14339	-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	Yes
22839	Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	Yes
6150	Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	Yes
19513	And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	Yes
32234	We're going to be able to.	No
8750	So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.	No
28828	Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	No
4253	And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
1379	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	Yes
12854	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	No
12593	He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	No
18564	"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	No
19805	But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	No
17807	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	No
1349	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	No
8920	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	Yes
26918	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	No
27705	And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	Yes
619	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	No
14016	Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	No
10353	We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	No
26581	It's going to help everything.	No
12827	Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	No
23217	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	No
11668	I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.	No
6176	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	Yes
1538	I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.	No
22733	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.	No
7842	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	Yes
32855	To go back to the very, very first question.	No
21120	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	No
27396	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	No
22377	Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	No
17008	Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	No
29287	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	No
20024	This is an issue they've brought up.	No
27390	I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	No
3233	Another point I wanna make is this.	No
15589	There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	No
8609	In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.	Yes
29236	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	Yes
19975	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	No
12111	Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	Yes
24039	But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	No
1678	I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	No
3081	So strong economy is very important.	No
34141	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	No
22235	Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	No
21139	We need to think differently about the issue.	No
11398	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	No
1579	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	Yes
19381	So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	No
17553	What does this mean in real life?	No
32158	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	No
34113	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	No
20144	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	No
32985	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	No
566	And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.	Yes
16243	Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.	No
15255	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	Yes
2043	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	No
25619	I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely.	No
16701	But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	Yes
13267	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	Yes
1677	It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	No
17870	Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	Yes
12075	But I feel very strongly about that.	No
1714	And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.	No
6930	It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.	Yes
27377	We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	Yes
78	But we also have to take demand seriously.	No
18554	But I have a plan to do it.	No
6520	Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	No
9967	You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	No
19405	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	Yes
2977	He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.	No
9278	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	No
32986	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	No
33	And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	No
32829	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	No
23314	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	Yes
18209	The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	No
28461	We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	No
24081	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	No
106	And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	Yes
13592	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	Yes
3059	There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.	No
17359	The American people want their children educated.	No
16038	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	No
22194	But she is absolutely right.	No
33461	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	No
19315	I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	No
3692	We've got to invest in science and technology.	No
17429	There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	No
16438	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	No
13238	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	No
1033	"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	No
24530	But I can tell you this.	No
22990	That's why the Patriot Act was important.	No
12074	She's worked on it longer than I have.	No
16625	But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	No
6831	It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	No
11077	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	No
4244	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	No
23317	We ought to be shutting those down.	No
19352	And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	No
6320	Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	No
23861	I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	No
4359	And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	No
6401	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	No
15802	In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	No
7726	Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	Yes
18470	As the politics change, his positions change.	No
13713	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	Yes
24457	So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them.	No
2190	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	Yes
25091	We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	No
3363	I believe we can and we ought to.	No
21678	Do you want jobs in the inner city?	No
3210	He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	Yes
1982	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	No
20557	It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.	No
34433	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	No
23771	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	No
28640	I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	No
3554	This one's kind of old.	No
31984	His was what he's done to women.	No
13598	I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	Yes
24622	To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	No
2093	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	Yes
34130	They want to look good.	No
13806	But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.	No
25704	I was going to applaud, too.	No
27675	We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	No
16804	And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.	Yes
8514	The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.	Yes
24928	I have ordered an investigation.	Yes
16013	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	No
19032	And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	No
18629	I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	No
24197	Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.	No
25914	I think we need to go back and take a look.	No
14315	So we're making dramatic progress.	No
13014	Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	Yes
12890	And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.	Yes
15404	Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	No
4346	And this is the greatest country on Earth.	No
24573	I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	No
12938	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	Yes
8117	If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	No
27727	That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	Yes
12610	We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	No
23820	I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.	Yes
19688	So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	No
15540	The Vice President talks about national security.	No
3168	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	No
4325	Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	No
13160	But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.	No
14474	And they buried it till right after the election.	Yes
27822	And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	Yes
11531	But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	No
26161	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	No
17448	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	No
18744	I believe we could have done better.	No
12601	Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	No
19705	Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	No
22013	It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.	No
8156	I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	No
32517	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	No
19968	That's what our message is to the people watching.	No
34444	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	No
23054	Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?	No
5848	You know, here's what I would say.	No
28294	I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	No
33462	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	No
2476	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	No
14681	It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	No
13099	As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	No
14067	But that's happening as we sit here today.	No
17895	Are we better of with this arms race?	No
13736	I think it's been pretty impressive.	No
16447	Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	No
21118	That is what it is.	No
8191	Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	No
1034	I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	No
24729	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	No
21543	That's not specific in terms of a program.	No
3515	I do not think that they are.	No
26028	I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	No
24335	I mean, that's been done.	Yes
25819	We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.	No
11725	That's what it's meant to do.	No
11939	And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.	No
17394	I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	Yes
22787	Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	No
10257	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	No
16563	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	Yes
21486	I don't want to --	No
7807	This we must get across to the world.	No
22303	It ought to be tried.	No
21850	That means keep government out of it.	No
3958	So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
19380	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	No
16553	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	Yes
28584	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	No
12847	The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.	Yes
9394	That's not an energy strategy for the future.	No
26136	There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.	Yes
26917	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	No
9935	Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	Yes
26850	Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.	No
34280	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	Yes
27111	That's exactly what we're doing.	No
22582	That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	No
11914	We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	No
20205	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	No
1688	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	No
15809	I agree with the Governor on athletics.	No
21454	Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.	No
20110	Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.	Yes
17192	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	No
33223	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	Yes
15443	I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	No
13886	You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	No
17776	But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	No
2343	It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	No
20841	Here is the role of the federal government.	No
15202	And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	No
25775	They were presidents at historic times.	No
13020	What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	No
27010	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	No
19582	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	Yes
17911	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	No
26428	We have a good, stable economic policy.	No
32863	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	No
27148	That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	No
27339	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	No
17370	I've said it's going to take some work.	No
18602	He has more of the same.	No
12645	And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	No
22963	I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	No
32135	And it hasn't been finished at all.	No
24204	This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.	No
17568	They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	Yes
20057	They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	No
25632	We know nothing about them.	No
7195	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	Yes
13234	We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.	No
15518	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	Yes
8713	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.	Yes
32577	Why didn't you do it?	No
25786	We don't talk about it.	No
8212	But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	No
26903	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	No
15394	Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	No
2217	They'll have at least two plans.	Yes
7274	Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	No
11135	... just a quick follow-up on this.	No
675	Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	No
2952	In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.	Yes
2730	Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	No
4332	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	No
19689	We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	Yes
22029	Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	No
8200	The same is true of highways.	Yes
17716	We're going to see that it doesn't.	No
34173	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	No
34035	But I think they're going to see through it.	No
16679	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	No
10497	I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	No
7140	The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	Yes
13940	No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	No
2728	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	No
1447	Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
17309	Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	No
26225	But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	No
29289	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	No
24150	And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	No
18843	But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	No
24171	Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.	No
27668	Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	No
25214	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	Yes
24563	See, our differences are our strengths.	No
17024	It calls for more of the same.	No
32464	Well, why didn't she change it?	No
18100	But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.	No
23436	He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	No
20035	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	No
8309	I think that this farm policy has failed.	No
17161	I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	No
20773	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	Yes
16832	Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	No
24041	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	Yes
13809	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	Yes
24438	The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	No
13625	But not by raising taxes.	No
1188	If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	No
15272	the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	Yes
20351	It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	No
10835	You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?	Yes
18408	So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.	No
15438	There is a partnership involved in our nation.	No
24715	And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	No
20173	I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	No
19407	Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	No
19109	We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
31993	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	No
850	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	No
26516	You're going to have to watch it.	No
29517	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	No
32109	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	Yes
22165	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	No
22082	I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	No
18453	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	No
22915	It hurts the middle class.	No
16109	That is absolutely not true.	No
17286	All history tells us that that's a mistake.	No
7107	We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	No
17508	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
7794	This goes to our survival.	No
26908	With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	No
92	Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	Yes
12063	Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.	No
8352	As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	No
24802	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	No
32882	... but we believed that we could make the country better.	No
28398	So I want to do something about that.	No
24373	They are making some progress, not enough for us.	No
29164	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	No
1259	And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.	No
32241	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	No
845	So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	No
785	Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	No
4162	So let me get this right.	No
25539	"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	No
18358	Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	Yes
27914	And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	Yes
23001	This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	No
17013	And I believe that we can bind our wounds.	No
9231	That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	No
23106	Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	No
25967	Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	No
4104	Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	No
8499	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	No
24448	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	No
26529	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	No
358	Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	Yes
6905	Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	No
30247	It's not an accurate one.	No
28626	I'm for research and development.	No
15490	We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	No
14719	I know we can do better.	No
34061	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	Yes
30363	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	Yes
16700	I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	No
18954	No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	No
16797	He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.	No
34296	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	No
16778	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	Yes
23055	You know what he said?	No
18003	I've shown the American people I know how to lead.	No
4404	You know, my father came from Kenya.	No
9986	His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.	Yes
16953	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	Yes
17767	Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?	No
20612	But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	No
16731	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	No
21767	Send us some people that will pass the idea.	No
8152	I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	No
291	"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."	No
15970	In other states, we've done it.	Yes
25169	We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.	No
11746	And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	No
14704	I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	No
8806	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	Yes
14934	We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	No
8555	Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	Yes
2199	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	Yes
21740	So why pass a law that won't fix it?	No
7157	It's to make sure we raise standards.	No
6571	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	No
9970	I don't check it that often.	No
20384	That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.	No
18832	Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	No
15797	Members of the clergy who have done the same.	No
6927	It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	No
22040	To get the interest rates down.	No
31926	And that's what I want to talk about.	No
23779	And abroad, we're at war.	No
24298	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	Yes
28363	This is a big spender.	No
26230	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	No
17746	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	No
26774	But we're not there yet.	No
23104	You can pull it off of the Internet.	No
10561	This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	No
17719	Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.	No
12475	This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	No
29496	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	No
3355	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	No
32153	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	No
23456	Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	Yes
14264	And I just had to work that in.	No
1061	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	No
12820	But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	No
1535	We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	Yes
21196	This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	Yes
32184	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
22448	Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.	No
4158	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	No
34269	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	No
23945	You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.	Yes
22451	Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	No
3957	I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	No
12627	Is our strength and prestige rising?	No
2109	What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	No
2316	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	Yes
25136	In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	Yes
11028	I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	No
20143	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	No
20053	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	No
359	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	Yes
6880	Once again, the president is misleading America.	No
679	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	No
29393	... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	Yes
15929	So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.	No
11014	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	No
13186	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	No
33423	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	No
21683	And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	No
15807	Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.	No
26924	Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	No
7733	Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	No
6797	And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	No
17980	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	No
34102	I've got no illusions about that.	No
1829	And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	No
7040	People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.	Yes
2427	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.	Yes
31898	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	No
8182	Now last year, of course, was 1958.	No
32414	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	No
19997	I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.	Yes
23721	"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off."""	No
18959	That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	No
32215	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	Yes
34367	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	No
33548	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	Yes
15187	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	Yes
14198	This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	No
29690	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	No
13155	We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	No
94	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	Yes
7683	And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.	No
173	It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.	No
29952	It doesn't work that way.	No
32308	So he would have been alive today.	No
33100	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	No
33705	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	Yes
18198	We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	Yes
17129	This is the worst trade year in American history by far.	Yes
6083	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	No
14518	Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.	No
29152	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	Yes
11008	Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	No
766	That is a very serious charge against the president.	No
8305	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	No
27076	And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	Yes
26234	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	No
3238	Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	Yes
1082	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	No
34050	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	No
24709	I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.	Yes
29692	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	No
26062	You got two years to look for a job.	No
8450	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.	No
15260	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	Yes
10249	We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	No
23087	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	Yes
10945	He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	No
28251	Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	Yes
17123	It was $200 billion deficit instead.	Yes
22500	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	No
30369	You asked me a question.	No
19976	So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	No
13335	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	No
25137	The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	No
31990	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	Yes
19745	Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	No
23780	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	No
18041	Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.	Yes
6906	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	Yes
28145	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	No
14473	Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	Yes
17790	If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	Yes
16711	Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	Yes
17234	We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	No
14022	Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.	Yes
314	My parents came to this country as immigrants.	No
21070	I am opposed to it.	No
17491	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	No
19797	When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	No
16970	So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	No
3753	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
18233	We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.	No
34053	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	No
23029	Just want to make sure they're safe.	No
18969	And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	No
24999	And I made it plain to them, we're not.	No
12757	And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	No
9088	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	No
11577	Now, have I got that wrong?	No
16020	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
26949	We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	No
24412	And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.	Yes
30198	I know how to win.	No
8584	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	No
28702	I was on my peroration.	No
14896	The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	Yes
26188	And so let me just say this.	No
6909	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	Yes
3484	So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	No
26053	And three of those checks were my grandparents'.	No
6086	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	Yes
575	But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.	No
12695	We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.	Yes
19638	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	No
25942	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	Yes
11867	Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	No
9074	Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	Yes
20212	I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	No
29691	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	No
14983	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	No
17918	We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.	No
20847	Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	No
19334	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	No
17804	And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	No
23249	He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	No
17606	I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	Yes
7006	We heard the same thing.	No
7295	I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	Yes
948	I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	No
17171	Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	No
10632	That's really part of your mistrust here.	No
7907	We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.	No
15968	The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	No
22283	Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	No
19156	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	Yes
28537	I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.	No
25192	You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.	No
25622	We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	No
22613	But 9/11 changed it all.	No
27977	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
20913	Let me give you another example.	No
18660	We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	No
14717	I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.	No
17759	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	Yes
24604	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	Yes
16623	For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	Yes
26049	Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	Yes
2222	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	No
559	And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	No
23010	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	No
8363	There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	No
26787	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	No
8809	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	No
32259	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	No
24080	We have spent $4 trillion worth.	Yes
15943	And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	No
15857	Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	No
10775	And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.	No
24342	"We said, ""Peace through strength,"" and it worked and the cold war is over."	No
8067	Now that means the best leadership.	No
1163	I don't believe it does.	No
15799	I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	No
23853	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	Yes
14516	I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.	Yes
25240	It is a question of leadership.	No
29057	I think it's the people's money.	No
30129	And they're going to do that.	No
34152	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	No
14848	This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	No
3014	And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	Yes
24310	And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	No
3269	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	No
16641	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	Yes
16463	It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	Yes
493	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	No
9810	In fact, he doubled it.	Yes
22565	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	Yes
1574	And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	No
18370	It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	No
20897	We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.	No
7072	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	No
12040	I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	No
7437	I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.	No
17157	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	Yes
17817	Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	Yes
27509	And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	Yes
5918	Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	No
33872	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	Yes
20439	I commend you for supporting that.	No
26930	Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	Yes
17445	I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	No
34431	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	No
18099	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	No
27256	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	Yes
28567	Let me tell you my position.	No
25189	And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	No
15922	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	No
25757	I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	No
8667	Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	Yes
23641	My opponent was against that.	Yes
16041	But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	No
26352	But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	Yes
12525	In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	Yes
12643	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	Yes
14231	We can't get anything done.	No
18575	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	Yes
21207	Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.	No
12392	I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	No
24414	That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	No
14448	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	Yes
26018	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	No
11030	My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	No
27173	Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	No
8009	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	No
29309	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	Yes
26716	Why should they be rifling through your files?	No
26723	One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	No
25693	Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	No
18056	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	No
16833	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	No
17402	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	Yes
6940	Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	No
6966	We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	No
16396	That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	No
20033	But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	No
14389	This goes on night and day.	No
6788	My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.	No
8464	It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.	Yes
636	We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.	Yes
15356	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	No
34335	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	No
26761	Well, I hope I made my answer clear.	No
18641	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	No
2099	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	Yes
13157	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	No
10324	Government does not create jobs.	No
23335	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	No
3601	And I pay for every dime of it.	No
16590	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	Yes
2416	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	Yes
15688	And that's the kind of America I want.	No
16089	And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.	No
29771	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	No
26500	Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	Yes
9904	And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.	No
7934	I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	No
18798	I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.	No
23177	We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	Yes
11476	It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	No
16503	In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.	Yes
32275	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	No
12895	If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	No
12191	So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	No
2612	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	Yes
18593	That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	No
869	I've picked a lot of people.	No
14073	And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	No
11995	Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	Yes
6842	We're beginning to do it.	No
3807	And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.	No
23613	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	No
25428	Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	No
8977	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	No
19995	You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	No
31888	I'm not proud of it.	No
311	Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.	No
28660	I don't think that's the role of the president.	No
22920	We're going to build alliances.	No
9662	That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	No
1562	I don't believe the present administration has done that.	No
5810	That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.	No
15382	When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	Yes
13831	I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.	Yes
1399	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	No
3045	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	Yes
23620	And I have to make that judgment.	No
18119	He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	No
20896	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	No
6267	In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	No
11469	The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.	No
19330	You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	No
24647	Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	Yes
10721	We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	No
7758	So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	No
1109	In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	No
12877	But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	No
8805	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	Yes
23881	We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	No
22913	And a lot of our military are underpaid.	Yes
10335	In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	No
25309	I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	No
20840	But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	No
21639	But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	Yes
25294	We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.	No
33803	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	No
17026	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	No
12909	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	No
32766	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	No
13600	Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.	No
13714	We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	Yes
16947	I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	No
16650	Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.	No
3589	I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.	No
14245	Now, I think that's going back to where we started.	No
22134	So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	No
22141	Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.	Yes
20720	We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	No
15860	Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.	No
12991	More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	Yes
169	What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.	Yes
29562	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	No
16560	It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	No
20550	And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	No
29688	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	Yes
27672	But we have some work to do.	No
15912	Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?	No
7016	Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.	No
32015	So you really owe him an apology.	No
14496	You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	No
882	And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	No
16783	As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.	Yes
1283	Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.	No
26845	So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.	No
18615	That's why it's essential we win.	No
13304	We can't settle for anything but the best.	No
9936	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	No
26961	And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).	Yes
20868	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	No
32084	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	Yes
32186	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	No
19650	The President was opposed to it in 1993.	Yes
27966	Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	No
23873	I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.	No
17366	I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	No
26971	You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	Yes
21167	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	No
1212	Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	Yes
21761	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	No
10529	We've got to stop this greed and excess.	No
653	Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	No
4037	And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	No
26342	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	No
8236	It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
3264	I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	No
21256	One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	No
27740	Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	No
2328	But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	Yes
12732	We will select the best man we can get.	No
27632	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	No
9044	We spoke a multitude of tongues.	No
13627	So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	No
23229	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	No
23353	We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.	Yes
11242	You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	Yes
460	And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	No
30163	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	No
8472	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	Yes
14951	As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	Yes
18468	I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	No
15538	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	No
19961	And so I think you take a look at it.	No
22554	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	Yes
13216	I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	No
2733	I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.	No
31961	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	No
5580	Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	Yes
22193	We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	No
8548	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	Yes
24098	We've got to invest and grow.	No
29286	You can't bring back jobs.	No
23105	And you'll find a tort reform plan.	No
10665	We can work on nuclear power plants.	No
17398	So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	No
8923	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	No
15501	You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	No
29456	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	No
19205	We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.	Yes
12953	Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	Yes
6984	He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.	Yes
27803	We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	No
14924	When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	Yes
19873	And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	Yes
21233	I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.	No
22852	And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	No
19671	Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	Yes
29810	I'd like to respond to that.	No
21408	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	No
11106	They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	Yes
12260	And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.	No
10751	It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	No
23512	We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	No
1922	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	No
19711	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	No
22213	Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.	No
19660	If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	Yes
9216	But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	No
2111	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	No
13766	I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	No
32427	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	No
20994	I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	No
12575	I have sustained it since then.	Yes
19101	Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	No
21660	The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.	No
30190	You didn't hear what I said.	No
11411	That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	No
19369	All 50 states did it.	Yes
2086	... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	No
18467	I don't think he was misleading.	No
11640	And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	No
22298	It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	No
32149	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	No
2638	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
6942	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	No
955	Who has the experience that we trust?	No
16793	About a thousand raised their hands.	Yes
8503	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	Yes
27809	That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	No
32705	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	Yes
13260	Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	Yes
8883	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	No
20267	I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	Yes
4320	But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	No
8199	We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.	Yes
23200	Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.	No
16091	So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	No
1601	There are no magic answers to do it.	No
25259	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	No
20462	We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.	No
32936	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
3150	I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.	No
27098	We organized the Friends of Syria.	No
5809	And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	No
17206	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	No
472	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	No
24095	The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	Yes
24565	In athletics, we know it.	No
17803	That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.	No
27176	This -- we have weakened our economy.	Yes
3285	And let me make another observation.	No
5951	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	Yes
5925	She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	Yes
34264	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	Yes
5514	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	Yes
1097	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	No
7158	Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	No
20954	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	No
16334	His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.	Yes
24664	Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	No
30227	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	No
21333	I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	No
715	That's-at least that's what I read.	No
34018	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	No
7701	We sit on a conspicuous stage.	No
2644	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	Yes
26029	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	No
22088	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	No
11053	We are a force of good in the world.	No
26623	And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	No
20023	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	No
27408	And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	No
17551	Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	Yes
28959	But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	Yes
11836	And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.	No
27786	But this can't keep on going.	No
16529	And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	No
33325	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	No
10155	Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	Yes
873	I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	No
20657	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
20230	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	Yes
3607	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	Yes
12121	I want a smaller and smarter government.	No
18693	"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	No
32343	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	No
24637	And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.	No
7339	This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	Yes
1959	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	No
21304	We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.	Yes
27360	And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	No
20306	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	No
16202	I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	No
29827	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	No
20700	Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.	No
21384	I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	Yes
19484	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	Yes
23597	You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.	No
15208	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	Yes
22319	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	No
21397	We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	No
25852	Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	Yes
26419	We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	Yes
17975	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	No
10878	But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.	No
33318	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	No
29231	And that's a big, big factor.	No
10624	And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	No
27884	...you've had the floor for a while.	No
22612	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	No
11559	It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.	No
5700	Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	No
2399	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.	Yes
6578	I'm going to change that.	No
21618	Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	No
13641	My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	Yes
20702	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	No
4007	Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	Yes
2596	It's time for a new path.	No
12528	We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	Yes
17615	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	Yes
25630	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	No
8757	Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	Yes
33254	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	Yes
21364	So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	No
30219	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	Yes
25749	They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.	Yes
14495	The people need to take their government back.	No
13033	See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	No
3784	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	Yes
1679	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	No
6628	And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	No
356	But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	No
24998	Now, they claim they're not.	Yes
25642	We have met young America.	No
27209	And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	No
24417	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	No
29698	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	No
16766	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	No
7242	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	No
17535	I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	Yes
22160	I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
11552	I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	No
24807	There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.	No
13819	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	No
26811	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	Yes
3825	We took our eye off the ball.	No
16055	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	No
1501	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	Yes
16902	We will make some gains in the United States Senate.	No
28221	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	No
2588	And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	No
29646	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	Yes
16862	I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.	No
19779	That's why we're moving in the right direction.	No
3927	And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	No
2913	These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	No
24949	He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	No
19830	But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.	No
19248	I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.	No
12199	The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	No
17098	So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	Yes
1846	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	Yes
19818	I've reached out to people all my life.	No
15424	The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	No
19260	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	Yes
21664	Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	No
17588	Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	Yes
15355	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	No
22460	And we have got to put our nation back to work.	No
20388	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	No
24273	We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	No
28147	If you're poor, they pay all of it.	Yes
29668	I'll give you an example.	No
14183	I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	No
11345	Senator Obama had the opening.	No
33730	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	Yes
17449	I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	No
15644	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	No
25758	But it is very important.	No
20174	And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	No
875	I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	No
11217	I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	No
18989	Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	No
13798	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	Yes
236	The NIH is doing a good job in research.	No
24695	The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	Yes
22610	After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	No
8412	I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	No
9759	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	Yes
13282	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
32520	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	Yes
16867	I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	Yes
27910	That will not help us compete with China.	Yes
1403	But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	No
22243	By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	No
21620	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	No
11759	It needs to be available for emergency situations.	No
32010	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	Yes
16059	And I'm very proud of it.	No
25180	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	No
3919	What he said was a precipitous...	No
21496	Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.	Yes
17097	In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	Yes
18394	And our alliance is strong.	No
21559	I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	No
14314	And we got some very good Republican women running.	Yes
28040	He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	No
12560	Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.	No
2294	This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	No
3600	I think those are pretty important priorities.	No
21443	As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	No
8686	Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	No
9485	We created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
27156	You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	No
18301	The president and I have always agreed on that.	No
8473	And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	Yes
28782	That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	No
11566	When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	Yes
28253	I think that's a mistake.	No
9866	I want our legal system to work better.	No
24339	the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	No
18699	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	Yes
5568	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	Yes
3245	He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	No
8747	I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	Yes
15175	Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	No
6866	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	Yes
19242	I thought it was a good program.	No
2744	I'll get incomes up again.	No
18834	There's nothing wrong with that.	No
24068	It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	Yes
32736	And I'm pretty good at it.	No
17087	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	No
13915	I do understand creating jobs.	No
9734	And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	No
21820	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	No
32974	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	No
1938	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	No
24602	We have increased funding for AIDS.	Yes
19113	Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.	No
5970	"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	Yes
23546	To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	No
20583	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	No
21414	People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	Yes
23035	And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	No
15539	More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	Yes
8240	It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	No
26942	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	No
25376	But suppose we came up with that?	No
8999	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	Yes
9889	We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.	No
2724	And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.	No
25054	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	No
1980	Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.	No
17672	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	No
23125	Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	No
19410	We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	Yes
22812	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	No
24730	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	No
761	And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	Yes
15758	But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	No
20420	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	No
20504	I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	No
2628	So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	Yes
12598	It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	No
27992	We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	No
14963	In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	Yes
27551	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	Yes
4053	A testimony to you, Jim.	No
28235	Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	No
25179	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	No
34151	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	Yes
1006	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	No
6686	We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
10638	I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	Yes
32585	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
21748	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	No
33744	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	Yes
13394	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	Yes
24823	I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	No
8031	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	No
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
3070	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	No
13000	We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	No
6237	The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.	No
32772	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	No
13095	But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	No
24696	The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	Yes
18642	So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	No
4068	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	No
26943	That's not the right course for us.	No
16665	At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	Yes
15223	We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.	Yes
344	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	No
34267	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	No
19395	They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	No
8419	I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	No
16176	I am for clean water.	No
25965	We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	Yes
25781	I know you do it.	No
8295	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	No
33016	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	No
13299	I disapprove of the issue.	No
21110	If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	No
15188	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.	No
18111	The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	No
26502	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	No
27583	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	No
22016	And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.	No
28917	I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	No
8621	I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	No
6836	That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	No
28401	Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	No
18756	While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.	Yes
18709	And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	No
21238	I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	No
580	And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	Yes
22494	I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	Yes
8029	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	No
557	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	No
24905	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	Yes
21971	I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	Yes
21611	But there's going to be a new Congress.	No
29192	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	No
12893	Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	No
24136	I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	No
22187	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	No
12654	I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	No
16532	The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	No
19370	It took three and a half years.	Yes
20131	I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	No
33571	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	Yes
27124	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	No
13165	It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.	No
10447	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	No
8241	And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	No
29040	Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	Yes
528	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	Yes
18499	Her husband PJ got killed.	No
9899	And that's what we've done.	No
2011	And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	No
11787	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	No
8219	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	No
34354	In fact, I think just the opposite.	No
24094	People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	Yes
29317	And I have been a secretary of state...	No
872	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	No
10759	I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.	No
34321	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	No
25118	Our position happened to be at the airport.	No
20326	I believe we ought to give seniors more options.	No
12888	First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	No
3058	And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	No
25576	And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.	No
21797	And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.	No
22622	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	No
724	And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	Yes
3550	You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	Yes
25701	And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	No
12380	And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	No
7876	Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	Yes
20470	We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	No
3213	And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	No
1249	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	No
17241	And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	No
33273	Well, I think it's terrible.	No
2293	One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	Yes
19821	I'm not some extremist out here.	No
28518	And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
9941	Instead let people make their own choice.	No
19525	Well, I have a different view.	No
32271	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	Yes
18631	There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.	No
33593	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	No
23089	And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.	Yes
32088	She got it from the United States Congress.	Yes
27527	And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	Yes
2480	These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	No
18313	General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	Yes
230	But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	No
16461	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	Yes
16952	As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.	No
27685	But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	No
25687	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	No
11328	I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	No
18614	That's why it's essential we hold the line.	No
5623	Programs that we need, we should make them work better.	No
19292	We worked too hard to lower it.	No
16859	Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	Yes
28092	And I believe I can.	No
4273	And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	No
8397	And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	No
1732	My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	No
8497	And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	No
30331	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	No
27057	What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	Yes
28935	I think it is a deterrent.	No
7991	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	Yes
22781	Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	Yes
2633	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	No
1684	This is obviously a very tender topic.	No
20285	And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	Yes
2305	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	No
1542	What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.	No
11415	I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	No
3347	I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	No
16411	Thank you very, very much.	No
23172	He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	No
28526	But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	No
2332	Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	No
780	You're judged by the entire record.	No
33554	We are spending a fortune doing it.	No
1376	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	Yes
7439	Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	No
19204	We have record numbers of new small businesses.	Yes
14685	They don't want us talking about each other.	No
27652	You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	No
19978	They're having a hard time making ends meet.	No
7492	And I think we're both very lucky.	No
32847	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	No
29443	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	Yes
7327	It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	No
29343	I wrote about that in my book...	No
974	The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.	No
22896	One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.	No
23510	Now that's not a flip-flop.	No
32483	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	Yes
30144	Now it's in over 30 countries.	Yes
19953	Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.	Yes
6635	This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	Yes
7950	Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	No
23724	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	No
16706	We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	No
28915	I'm not proud of any record.	No
3591	Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.	Yes
11984	But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	No
8275	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	Yes
25220	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	Yes
12816	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	No
3184	But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	No
13605	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	No
16460	I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	No
27125	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	No
4065	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	No
32333	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	No
11838	And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	Yes
28111	So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	No
28188	And we have uninsured people in my state.	No
21209	One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	No
6748	And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	Yes
23578	It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	No
23742	Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	No
32930	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
12730	I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	No
23900	I think character is a very important question.	No
1055	I don't know how to deal with it exactly.	No
24	We've got to get after the users more.	No
11579	If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	No
3829	And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	No
27754	How strong is our economy?	No
30127	But I'm all for NATO.	No
14418	But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	No
25848	It shouldn't happen in America.	No
9359	You'll get your chance in a moment.	No
17481	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	No
11818	But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	No
1492	I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.	No
14010	Or do you just keep lunging in at will?	No
630	And I think I've had that.	No
14396	We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	Yes
22580	The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	Yes
11512	And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	No
24409	But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	No
21407	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	No
30279	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	No
12644	I believe that the world is changing fast.	No
18748	With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	Yes
30250	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	No
8847	for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	No
8142	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	No
29898	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	No
22904	Daniel, I don't support a draft.	No
23782	The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.	Yes
10736	It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.	Yes
19011	It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	No
23926	Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	No
28149	And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	No
8784	But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	Yes
2829	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	No
26287	We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.	No
25260	And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	Yes
14256	And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.	Yes
13384	I don't think we should have that kind of a program.	No
23483	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	No
25315	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	Yes
25351	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	Yes
4268	That's just not true, John.	No
29831	And it was terminated by current mayor.	Yes
7953	I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	No
20166	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	No
8463	Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.	Yes
12250	Well, let me start with Texas.	No
16063	I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	No
25369	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	No
24673	And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	No
24275	You'd go broke in a hurry.	No
25326	And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	No
13647	I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.	No
10628	The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	No
19910	But this is a very liberal administration.	No
20008	Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	Yes
22247	Those schools belong to you.	No
17277	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	No
32681	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	Yes
15742	Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	Yes
18600	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	No
14144	In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	No
13131	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	No
8012	But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	No
22953	Thank you very much, Ann.	No
23973	We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	No
17143	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	Yes
10387	That's what I've been doing for the last four years.	No
25820	It's about where we are now.	No
8444	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	Yes
13235	But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	No
7802	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	No
25905	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	No
6977	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	Yes
4145	The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	No
26667	Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	No
17315	With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.	No
7858	The question is what we're going to do in the future.	No
25711	We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	Yes
462	And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	No
6137	Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	No
2593	The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.	Yes
10909	I vote against them, my friends.	No
8749	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.	Yes
6622	They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	No
15846	It's gotten a little nasty.	No
17978	All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	No
2175	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	No
5896	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	Yes
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	Yes
32727	Why can't they do it quietly?	No
26757	We still have some of that hatred inside us.	No
3824	We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	Yes
17390	I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	No
22260	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	No
15868	Those are basic American values.	No
8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	No
5626	If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	Yes
698	So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	No
34	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
13154	The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.	No
4240	I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	Yes
540	The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	Yes
26259	I have never supported quotas.	Yes
13135	They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.	Yes
33867	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	Yes
25927	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	No
28318	They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	Yes
19597	They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	Yes
4326	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	Yes
3267	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	No
9275	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	No
3487	We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	No
28335	94% comes from the local level.	Yes
7522	"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	No
1020	I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	Yes
7159	"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."	Yes
20882	The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	Yes
32248	We're going to block grant into the states.	No
7536	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	No
19375	You know, mine doesn't work that way.	No
19541	We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	Yes
355	And we've got to attend to them.	No
8700	put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.	No
16846	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	Yes
28614	We need to open up markets.	No
28364	And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.	No
1972	And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.	Yes
15774	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	No
33782	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	Yes
28166	I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	No
1921	It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.	Yes
24904	This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	No
29034	I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	No
25489	But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	No
2602	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	No
4100	Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	Yes
12924	Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.	No
33222	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	No
10562	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	No
14021	I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.	No
16144	He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.	No
8456	Well as you take the bills -	No
29775	Now, I believe in community policing.	No
29724	We have to bring back law and order.	No
31847	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	No
5853	And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	No
14187	That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	No
12196	And secondly, I repeat to you --	No
23628	And I truly respect it.	No
7713	I would hope an incident like that would not happen.	No
21700	We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	No
15218	I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	No
16000	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	Yes
2756	You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	No
33115	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	No
11705	And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	No
13172	There must be an absolute guarantee.	No
25147	The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	Yes
14394	We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	Yes
23059	Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	No
14913	Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	Yes
19670	I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	Yes
26347	We had a better idea.	No
8329	But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	No
13717	I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	No
8120	Are we as strong as we should be?	No
25273	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	No
14342	And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	No
23857	We have got to have the courage to change.	No
8466	And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	Yes
32977	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	No
19868	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	Yes
15081	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	No
18148	Can I respond to that?	No
23875	Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	No
12059	It's really a matter of culture.	No
8733	possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	Yes
9203	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	No
22280	Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	No
19594	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	No
7605	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	Yes
7254	They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	No
19962	The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	No
33703	China is growing at 7 percent.	Yes
27747	They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	Yes
3878	We don't want our kids coming back here.	No
11722	I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	No
5721	First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.	Yes
33162	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	No
33309	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	Yes
3654	You've got to look at our records.	No
8150	A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.	No
1181	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	No
4257	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	No
1085	Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.	No
9690	Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	No
20908	Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.	No
32669	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	No
17210	I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	No
3639	Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	Yes
9277	20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.	Yes
14064	We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.	No
13374	"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""	No
6901	If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	No
21126	And you know what, the issue is changing.	No
11088	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	No
1296	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	Yes
29923	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	No
26817	We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	No
31922	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	No
22205	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	Yes
14849	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	No
17798	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	Yes
11518	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	No
7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	No
13317	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	No
12897	If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	No
24285	And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	No
29155	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	No
19720	Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.	No
14233	And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.	No
27373	If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	No
7018	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	No
13477	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	No
33357	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	No
22572	The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
22442	Congress -- they're all good people.	No
14494	It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.	No
26030	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	No
22183	We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	No
1315	I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	No
1056	Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.	Yes
23509	And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	No
25286	I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.	No
32706	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	No
13481	Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	No
3938	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	Yes
26944	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	No
16476	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	Yes
18039	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	Yes
10185	We're starting to see gains in math and science.	Yes
19098	We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	Yes
8163	I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	No
25352	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	No
17668	I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.	No
23500	A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	No
8116	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	No
18900	We have to do this job.	No
26348	Now we have a majority and we get a president.	No
8688	I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	Yes
19736	So it's not that we always disagree.	No
3284	Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	No
1465	Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
26570	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	No
17365	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	No
7915	It - my view is the same as his.	No
32207	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	No
9029	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	No
10728	You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	No
12154	He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	Yes
12915	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	No
15904	And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	No
20503	As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	No
9248	That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	Yes
24154	Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.	No
3175	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	No
26655	We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	Yes
8151	Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.	Yes
16241	Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.	No
15752	We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.	No
19852	Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	No
21165	I want to focus on results.	No
7895	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	No
15666	And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	No
11479	But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	No
6056	If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	Yes
2605	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	No
23879	Many would trade for it.	No
9523	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	No
1763	But not due to his policies.	No
21601	But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.	No
10782	The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	No
14486	The debt and the deficit.	No
17184	It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	No
13228	I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.	No
28194	There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.	No
17558	That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.	Yes
20257	It's a difference of opinion.	No
29323	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	Yes
18038	And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	No
1902	Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	No
33147	What kind of rights will Americans have?	No
10440	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	No
6923	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	No
16666	I don't know where that money would come from.	No
32448	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
16597	When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	Yes
16021	George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.	Yes
7597	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	No
2979	The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	Yes
26144	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	No
2752	If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	No
34065	This is how Donald thinks.	No
17698	They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.	No
12164	And they get health care.	Yes
25065	Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	No
18480	There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.	No
24789	I don't like to see the country's principles violated.	No
8730	All of these things can be done.	No
15237	The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	Yes
28310	We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	No
30109	They were choking on the sanctions.	No
23380	I'm going to be a president who believes in science.	No
20085	Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	Yes
7773	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	Yes
6516	Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.	Yes
19473	And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	No
10131	And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	No
4327	We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	No
32111	What about the other 15,000?	No
24468	It can be a single-parent family.	No
17096	The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.	Yes
9184	And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.	No
14891	The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	Yes
22747	Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	No
11776	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	No
17217	We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.	No
25808	Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	No
26788	The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	No
18157	No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.	No
12720	Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	No
26818	But beyond that we need to address the economy.	No
23670	Put a head fake on us.	No
12153	And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	Yes
10067	But she works for me.	No
32549	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	Yes
15251	To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.	No
30020	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	Yes
4213	I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	No
20987	In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	No
273	We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	No
9708	Our party has been focused too long.	No
512	That's the way you help people.	No
28694	I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	No
18347	They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.	No
15785	But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	No
22132	We've got agreements, but they are still there.	No
9564	That's math that doesn't add up.	No
27852	We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	No
1569	A lot remains to be done.	No
8185	this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	Yes
34128	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	No
28718	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	Yes
31940	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	Yes
21076	Now, Social Security has never done that.	Yes
26196	My whole administration is about your future.	No
3789	I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	Yes
30431	And I don't deserve that.	No
23306	As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	Yes
15554	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	Yes
18203	You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.	No
18559	The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	No
2914	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
26309	He won't tell you because he can't.	No
14469	These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.	No
25508	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	Yes
29512	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	Yes
14517	But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	Yes
23753	I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.	No
22558	I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	No
23440	I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.	Yes
26065	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	No
272	But I salute him for his passion.	No
14637	Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.	No
17386	We did, 25 percent across the board.	Yes
5971	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	No
25719	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.	No
27155	But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	No
7936	I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.	No
21833	Ross was very articulate across the country.	No
1280	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	Yes
1130	And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.	No
25698	But in any event, I understand the problems.	No
28057	We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	Yes
34202	No, you are the one that's unfit.	No
5795	And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	No
191	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	No
26582	Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	No
21497	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	No
29951	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	No
12682	Now let's just see what this means.	No
8936	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	No
33630	But they have to pay up.	No
34430	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	No
22463	In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.	No
29805	They've got a lot of concerns.	No
98	And we want to bring him to justice.	No
11890	And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	No
8759	So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	No
25037	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	No
23899	I think the American people should be the judge of that.	No
9669	That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	No
11809	I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.	No
3012	Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	No
15182	And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	No
26970	You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	Yes
17122	We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	Yes
22083	You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.	No
3749	Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.	No
2167	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	Yes
18652	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	Yes
2831	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	No
24427	This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	No
1325	I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	No
12658	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	Yes
29327	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	No
9196	We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	No
16770	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	Yes
16180	I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	No
15410	But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	Yes
10816	Social Security is not that tough.	No
4118	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	No
23728	I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.	No
133	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	No
33343	I don't want to rip families apart.	No
345	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	No
23886	Well, they've got a point.	No
16482	And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	Yes
20102	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	Yes
2198	And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	No
32607	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	No
29196	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	No
33427	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	Yes
32344	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	No
1385	The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	No
9506	And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	No
17765	Whose taxes will you raise?	No
11871	She said, reading is the new civil right.	No
19445	But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	No
12632	In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	No
16790	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	Yes
27247	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	Yes
11775	The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	No
10954	Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	Yes
19459	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	No
24804	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	Yes
19507	Look at where we are today.	No
661	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	No
14989	And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	Yes
13109	This is the history of dealing with dictators.	No
15563	I hear this talk about a blank check.	No
23426	That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	No
195	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	No
7924	I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	No
20694	We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	No
28848	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	No
13316	We cannot have it in our hearts.	No
3800	I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	No
21798	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	No
26227	We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	Yes
1598	"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""	No
26210	And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	No
32154	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	No
18876	But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.	No
2381	I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	Yes
2814	That's got to be changed.	No
9939	Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	No
17996	And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.	No
2069	The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	No
1505	I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	No
29559	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	No
7144	Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	Yes
10576	My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	No
3027	He indicates he would not make those.	No
2926	After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	Yes
21705	In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	Yes
12465	There's too many issues left unresolved.	No
16830	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	Yes
28379	He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	No
15172	You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	No
17155	I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.	No
3812	And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.	No
20615	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	No
6970	And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.	No
15569	So I'm pledged to do that.	No
3565	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	Yes
17133	I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	No
15798	Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	No
13409	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	No
27137	That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	No
3884	An election law just in the last few days.	No
21339	The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	No
14027	I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.	No
33830	And I think it's her campaign.	No
23537	I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way.	No
8701	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	No
18992	I can't say it any more plainly.	No
28754	We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	No
27670	This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.	No
17906	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	No
19450	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	No
22615	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	No
32166	But we've got to get costs down.	No
22480	They're not going to be solved overnight.	No
3673	With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	Yes
6510	No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	No
8762	Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	No
25043	He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.	Yes
21918	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	No
6974	It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	No
9051	And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	No
7620	The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	Yes
25406	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	No
626	But look, let me sum it up.	No
12850	The Soviet Union does understand strength.	No
2340	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	No
27532	And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	No
29580	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	No
25066	And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.	Yes
16573	As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	No
8995	For a return to traditions and values that we once had.	No
33101	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	No
19456	You don't buy any gun.	No
22914	These are families that get hurt.	No
22144	Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	No
24223	The plans are all over Washington.	No
17645	It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.	Yes
28829	And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	Yes
2459	But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	No
18911	I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	No
23838	I think we've dramatically changed the world.	No
14971	The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	Yes
18208	We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	No
25563	Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	No
14533	Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	No
16536	Keep my promises to the American people.	No
27811	But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	Yes
7504	We can have health care for all Americans.	No
13031	In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	No
21605	And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.	No
7707	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	No
14953	Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.	Yes
34403	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	No
18927	We convinced Libya to disarm.	Yes
32350	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	Yes
12046	The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	No
17009	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	No
23527	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	No
19636	This is a serious business.	No
24957	And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?	No
1367	I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	No
14648	It doesn't work that way when you're president.	No
10381	Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	No
20092	But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	No
16610	This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	No
20017	I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	No
2174	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	Yes
10734	I believe in the need for increased oil production.	No
32294	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	No
11695	And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.	No
2494	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	Yes
13703	So we've got to do that.	No
13105	Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	No
7641	We lost three thousand American lives.	Yes
3893	And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	Yes
15991	The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	No
23248	And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	Yes
24717	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	No
17748	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	No
19747	We've lost credibility around the world.	No
8823	or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	Yes
29497	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	Yes
12131	49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	Yes
24182	There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	No
30325	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	No
21737	On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	No
6631	I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	No
1567	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	No
27179	Our military is second to none in the world.	Yes
8477	Well obviously my views are a little different.	No
6174	You were offered a chance to join.	No
23969	Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.	No
841	And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	No
8424	We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	No
10053	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	No
21821	To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	No
16737	Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.	No
13459	If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	No
2112	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	No
32306	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	Yes
150	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	No
3956	Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	No
22080	Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	No
13382	And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	Yes
2326	Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.	Yes
18077	I decided to go there myself.	No
32167	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	No
30197	I have a winning temperament.	No
20165	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	No
8360	Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	No
2826	We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	No
17964	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	No
10560	What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?	No
18447	And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	No
33716	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	Yes
26628	Now none of that will happen anymore.	No
10259	I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	No
1816	I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	No
28558	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	No
20827	It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	No
162	So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	No
12577	Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.	Yes
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
22421	I'm just not going to do that.	No
297	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	No
21899	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	No
13899	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	No
22792	We didn't have enough forces.	No
33321	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	No
24159	We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.	No
12761	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	Yes
15048	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	No
12547	That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	No
12751	"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."	No
20338	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	Yes
15728	We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	Yes
22843	So what do we do?	No
4319	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	No
2336	That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	Yes
20459	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	No
11737	And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	No
27758	The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
30249	I agree with her on one thing.	No
19767	It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	No
19993	It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	No
1394	Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	No
28172	And you need to know the record here.	No
19378	But let me respond to what you said.	No
32480	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	Yes
22248	And we put up with that.	No
6319	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	Yes
17812	In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	Yes
24260	I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	No
12155	There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	No
34409	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	No
9256	And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.	No
1042	I think the American people are too.	No
11160	So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.	No
7589	Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.	Yes
13516	Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	Yes
3968	It's ruled by a handful of tribes.	No
28142	The governor talked about Medicare.	No
33794	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	No
7149	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	No
28923	If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	No
3079	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	Yes
26119	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	Yes
12202	That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	Yes
29751	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	No
13544	Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	No
12257	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	No
15537	And that's why people are so concerned.	No
8726	We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	Yes
16850	But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	No
27236	We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	No
15432	It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	No
3872	I was honored to be there.	No
26089	We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	No
14915	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
293	And I don't agree with them.	No
25824	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
27065	And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	No
3715	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	Yes
6829	And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	Yes
24455	Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.	Yes
20599	But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	No
16866	President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.	Yes
21824	They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	Yes
30406	Where did you find this?	No
2949	We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.	Yes
17002	We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	No
8019	We should come to its defense.	No
4015	So I have a record.	No
25811	That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	Yes
16371	That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	No
17814	And the result is exactly what we see.	No
22117	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	No
24125	I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.	No
4019	This was last August, a year ago.	No
26637	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	No
19107	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	No
878	We shouldn't do that.Ã¢â€°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	No
6695	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	Yes
33967	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	Yes
14677	Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	No
23566	I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	No
25238	This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	No
12189	Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	Yes
13908	Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	No
31846	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	No
2147	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	Yes
9718	My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	No
29594	That I can tell you.	No
21875	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	No
9041	Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.	No
13868	We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	No
3437	And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	No
24435	I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	No
2430	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	No
32570	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	Yes
16250	I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	No
22060	That is priority one in this country.	No
4245	So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	No
13741	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	No
22052	I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	No
15816	He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	Yes
33098	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	No
7592	And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	Yes
2368	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	Yes
19871	It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	Yes
4077	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	No
33541	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	No
17534	It's been a big failure.	No
31891	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	No
17687	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	Yes
16854	These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	Yes
26462	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	No
25011	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	No
5857	Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	No
1040	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	No
25014	I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.	No
3357	Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	Yes
29704	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	No
792	And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	No
11439	So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	No
26846	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	No
7787	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	No
12367	I feel very strongly the same place.	No
19092	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	No
9916	I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	No
25754	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	No
8459	It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	Yes
9137	And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	No
8021	Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	No
23138	First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	Yes
1572	I served an a hospital authority.	No
7532	Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	No
20551	And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	No
29784	We cannot just say law and order.	No
20614	I think that's the wrong thing.	No
28280	It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	Yes
2743	There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.	No
12065	And we can enforce law.	No
26424	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	No
10669	My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
28921	I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	No
186	But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	No
711	We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.	Yes
7906	I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	No
16999	We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	No
12772	Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.	No
29516	You know what that is?	No
18071	The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	No
20983	And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	No
27770	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	Yes
3296	But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.	No
6863	That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.	Yes
18511	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	No
19433	And we have a responsibility.	No
2746	We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.	Yes
894	I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	No
22611	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	No
7806	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	No
23751	We are not doing that today.	No
8420	Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	Yes
8734	That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	No
13518	Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	Yes
2026	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	No
20973	They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.	No
16795	And still he talks about - uh success.	No
23154	It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	No
34419	I have a plan for doing that.	No
33457	People are going to pour into our country.	No
503	So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	No
15446	Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	No
18837	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	No
876	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.	No
9912	If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.	No
17191	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	No
34146	So we're now going to take Mosul.	No
5911	And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	No
13465	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	No
21412	When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.	No
30316	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	No
19696	We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	No
429	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	Yes
18706	My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	No
444	And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	No
8177	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	No
27038	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	No
22086	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	Yes
1384	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	Yes
27364	We need to be talking about space.	No
1723	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	Yes
27073	It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	No
14061	But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	Yes
17900	Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?	No
33417	We will not have open borders.	No
22740	That was the right place.	No
29697	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	No
25790	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	No
7218	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	Yes
2943	I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	Yes
3568	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	Yes
7744	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	No
650	What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.	No
32449	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	No
14146	They have not been forthcoming.	No
33618	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	No
18305	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	No
9226	That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	Yes
14958	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	No
2535	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	No
11564	I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.	No
21610	We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	No
19342	That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	Yes
27210	We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	No
26019	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	Yes
11931	And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	No
13681	That's quite different than some.	No
15329	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	No
3147	He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	No
22970	Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	Yes
1423	Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	Yes
5674	And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	No
32932	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	Yes
3971	And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.	No
34175	We need to go after the leadership.	No
2680	We cut taxes 19 times.	Yes
18464	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	No
14850	There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	No
27142	No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	No
645	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	No
1282	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	Yes
28447	It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.	No
25846	Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	No
7667	And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	No
34398	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	No
14923	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	No
12016	But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	No
17142	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	No
25271	Now we have a runaway arms race.	No
17917	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	No
33940	Why don't you give back the money?	No
33915	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	Yes
14818	I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	No
34008	You should have changed the law.	No
32437	I have no loans from Russia.	Yes
6786	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	Yes
28367	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	No
25760	They're looking to us for leadership.	No
26170	The president has been AWOL for four years.	No
16676	He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.	Yes
17198	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	No
21556	But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	No
23085	That's what leadership is all about.	No
14678	They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.	No
18736	On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	No
17425	And so, my change had come earlier than that.	No
2530	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	No
21174	They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	No
30294	Nobody's ever seen that before.	No
11985	I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	No
12201	And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	Yes
19753	It is a very difficult environment.	No
18258	You've got to help us over there.	No
14312	-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	No
3696	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	No
27281	And those teachers can make a difference.	No
4061	Let's just make that very clear.	No
8666	That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	No
28197	The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	Yes
12726	I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.	No
10992	Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	No
1704	Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	No
26411	And my word is good.	No
13762	I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.	No
4258	Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.	Yes
34143	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	No
17703	I'm opposed to that, too.	No
29462	We've looked at your tax proposals.	No
16893	They have too many employees.	No
10838	I have fought excess spending.	Yes
31928	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	No
17717	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	No
27927	I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	No
20776	Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.	No
11828	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	No
23430	Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	No
15165	unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	No
7980	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	No
28055	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	No
11172	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	No
12910	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	No
8745	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	No
24613	It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	No
8206	We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.	Yes
27410	And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	No
27993	They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	No
20317	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	No
20757	He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	Yes
17758	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	No
8285	We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	Yes
3319	It's a matter of morality.	No
29790	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	No
16802	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	Yes
25094	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	No
2662	It's because I care about education for all of our kids.	No
34251	We gave them $150 billion back.	Yes
9037	Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	No
15326	In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.	No
12470	I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.	No
668	Look at the INF treaty.	No
14044	And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.	No
29666	And that's what I do.	No
8317	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	No
24428	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	No
10818	We've got to sit down together across the table.	No
32147	If he wants to start, he can start.	No
19161	That's my difference with the President.	No
403	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	No
20999	We need to do more and better.	No
26318	I'm going to keep my word to the American people.	No
8260	He was nominated by it.	No
17874	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	No
22720	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	No
4247	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	No
19466	The administration says they support the instant check.	Yes
18142	More in July than June.	Yes
11700	First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.	No
6832	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	No
5574	We're not going to do that in my administration.	No
23592	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	No
25421	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	No
8035	I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	No
29409	Just go to her website.	No
15863	I thank you for that.	No
29582	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	No
18801	We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	Yes
2990	I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.	No
2224	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	No
1215	And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	Yes
3283	But let me comment on the report.	No
29758	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	No
7267	In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.	No
26103	And the government doesn't create jobs.	No
28570	None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	No
17605	Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.	No
1009	I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	No
18929	I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.	No
7466	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	No
2999	Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	Yes
22139	We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	No
3498	But there's also the issue of responsibility.	No
1172	I'd say, several hundred of them.	No
6964	And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	No
27526	This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	No
33390	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	Yes
30	Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	No
4217	It had everything to do with energy.	No
14992	"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	No
2592	The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	Yes
14747	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	No
25636	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	No
19833	It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	No
596	And he just lifted martial law.	Yes
2815	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	No
7798	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	No
8951	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	Yes
1491	And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.	No
20665	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	No
14087	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	Yes
21792	If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	No
22567	I've argued that we should fully funded it.	No
29132	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	Yes
15791	I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	No
20089	I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	No
18031	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	No
20129	A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.	No
12272	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	No
16078	Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.	No
24632	We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	No
33114	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	No
23188	We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	Yes
21757	I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.	No
19904	I feel strongly about education.	No
6741	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	No
14220	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	No
9934	I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	No
19936	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	No
10182	We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	No
25146	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	No
27164	Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.	No
11802	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	No
22259	Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	No
28742	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	No
13433	The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.	Yes
24516	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	No
2200	Benefits were not affected at all.	Yes
20027	And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	No
33527	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	No
23175	Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	Yes
19270	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	No
17959	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	No
12667	We want to be stronger.	No
6167	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	No
19025	I believe we can be successful.	No
20063	I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.	Yes
29699	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	No
7868	President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	No
1287	I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	No
17779	And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	No
1609	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	No
16341	I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	No
1350	And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	No
7977	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	No
22007	But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	No
15058	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	No
6775	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	No
11571	He is an indicted war criminal.	Yes
24411	I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	Yes
20947	But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.	No
21186	And incidentally, one of them is this.	No
20587	That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	No
18796	They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	No
13444	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	No
20072	And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	No
14346	I'd like to see those written instructions.	No
16198	Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.	No
25537	Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	Yes
16606	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	No
27397	Bob, I just need to comment on this.	No
20093	I wasn't just getting more power and more power.	No
6739	The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.	No
19039	If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	No
11532	And we have maintained the sanctions.	Yes
6522	I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.	No
33639	But we have horrible deals.	No
15402	So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.	No
24714	So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	No
13916	I do understand how to make things work.	No
27579	I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	Yes
22888	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	No
17185	I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	No
25075	There's a big difference between the two of us.	No
26989	I have clear eyes on this.	No
29715	You walk down the street, you get shot.	No
19421	Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.	No
17820	And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	No
22440	Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	No
16189	Come on, give me five.	No
21969	I'll tell you how it's affected me.	No
12800	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	No
16858	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	Yes
14713	And it's not tax and spend economics.	No
22928	Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	No
24988	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	No
32324	We have enough problems in this country.	No
10221	It used to be the United States of America.	No
11237	But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.	No
13125	Now, that is the issue.	No
25249	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	No
19393	These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	No
33638	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	No
19941	I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.	No
17743	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	No
11497	One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	No
574	I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	Yes
4380	So this is a national security issue.	No
27928	I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.	Yes
28260	First of all, vouchers are up to states.	No
22367	This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	No
23594	I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.	No
26112	First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	No
30097	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	Yes
19147	These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	No
12845	He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	No
7995	You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	Yes
19635	When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.	Yes
12174	I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	No
3432	So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.	No
6343	And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	No
8026	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	No
11729	It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	No
3424	I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	No
7091	The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	No
30262	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	Yes
27500	And I've been very clear to them.	No
14056	The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.	Yes
1049	I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	Yes
29220	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	No
34232	Take a look at it.	No
27892	They would have gone through a...	No
18217	We didn't need that tax cut.	No
13190	We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	No
3108	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	Yes
24074	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	Yes
12024	It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	No
12699	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	No
3670	Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	No
2972	We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	Yes
9086	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	No
24801	Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	No
3173	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	Yes
3822	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	Yes
23197	I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	Yes
8002	Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	Yes
21473	But that's what I feel.	No
5844	But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	No
27970	I want to see growing peace in this country.	No
29693	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	No
14492	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	No
598	And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	No
3185	The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	No
22691	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	No
29326	You were totally in favor of it.	Yes
28196	They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	No
21240	I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	No
12582	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	Yes
13702	It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.	No
25600	Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	Yes
13432	Many say four and a half per cent.	No
12110	They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.	No
8299	They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	No
17368	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	No
4280	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	No
10691	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	No
28135	We want them to continue that.	No
30169	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	Yes
8852	But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	No
27703	Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	No
18103	Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	Yes
27083	But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	No
21694	I support the right to keep and bear arms.	No
8145	I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.	No
24254	And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	No
1079	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	Yes
4021	And this was August, a year ago.	No
13262	For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	No
22199	So this is what our program is all about.	No
10828	Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	No
960	We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.	No
33687	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	No
20429	I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	No
8872	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	Yes
7725	And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	No
398	Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.	No
17777	"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"	No
6055	If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	No
21084	A promise made will be a promise kept.	No
27518	They must not develop nuclear capability.	No
19927	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	Yes
11646	My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	No
18517	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	No
7671	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	No
817	A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.	Yes
7780	And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	Yes
2968	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	No
2012	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	Yes
19857	But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	No
27536	And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	No
13166	It's a question of who they are.	No
33037	I will bring our energy companies back.	No
16140	That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	No
29925	He should have produced it a long time before.	No
22112	Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	Yes
14745	This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	No
31963	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	No
13323	Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	No
8208	We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.	Yes
8610	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	No
20170	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	No
27072	It's their route to the sea.	No
21877	He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.	Yes
13106	I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	Yes
17909	These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	No
17504	I don't know the answer to when life begins.	No
13084	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	No
24956	I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	No
12284	We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	No
6266	Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	No
26357	I work every day with people.	No
4384	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	No
2195	And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	No
16825	A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	Yes
704	An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.	Yes
21214	I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	No
13133	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	Yes
6225	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	No
14839	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	No
4340	That's going to be critical.	No
29486	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	No
2516	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.	No
24567	We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	No
21655	Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	No
22802	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	No
6396	And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	No
29200	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	Yes
32321	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	Yes
19349	That's why we need campaign finance reform.	No
7594	Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	No
29965	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	Yes
23208	And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	Yes
11704	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	Yes
14750	Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.	No
22835	I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	No
33233	So I'm very honored by all of that.	No
11520	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	No
21107	But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	No
25916	I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.	No
13328	I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.	No
16284	In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	No
12904	He says he supports the President's position.	Yes
3765	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	Yes
29889	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	Yes
16772	Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.	No
7893	I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.	Yes
25148	"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	Yes
8549	Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.	Yes
29825	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	No
22994	No, but he's for weakening it.	No
18973	It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	No
10500	Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.	No
22142	If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	No
844	And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.	No
17432	The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.	Yes
28709	And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	No
24465	I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	No
18590	When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	No
20111	We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	Yes
12760	Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	No
18817	We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	Yes
24327	National security, economic strength, democracy.	No
11557	The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	No
31909	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	No
18960	That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	No
23644	I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	No
24133	And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.	No
19706	We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	Yes
8192	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	No
19611	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	Yes
14949	most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	No
19701	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	Yes
2242	We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	No
21201	I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	No
23142	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.	Yes
33486	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	Yes
6967	But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	No
1917	And we talk about evidence.	No
3031	It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	No
7421	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	No
25417	Now, why do I support the freeze?	No
24550	This is a relevant question here tonight.	No
17565	Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	No
19907	Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	No
18118	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	No
28451	That's what a leader does.	No
29109	We also have to make the economy fairer.	No
32282	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	Yes
25948	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	No
32265	They'll never be the same.	No
22909	Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	No
8492	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	No
16137	There are we certainly ought to be able to	No
8247	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	No
17863	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	Yes
27468	I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	No
16404	I want to build on that.	No
6041	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	Yes
23081	Now, he talks about Medicare.	No
6563	We're not giving this away for nothing.	No
1942	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	No
24357	Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	No
9878	I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.	No
15423	I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	No
28504	The governor proposes $45 billion.	Yes
15389	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	Yes
14276	And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	No
18687	No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	Yes
6912	You want to buy into it, you can.	No
1419	And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	No
25626	I remember driving down the California coast one day.	No
9133	They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	No
10139	And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	No
14404	I said well, this is simple.	No
18019	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	Yes
18663	we'd be in a stronger place today.	No
11813	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	No
25154	And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	Yes
1030	The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	No
3132	Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	Yes
7109	Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	No
13482	Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	No
28740	Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	No
12975	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	No
27472	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	No
2639	All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.	No
8162	I want us to recapture that image.	No
9251	And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	Yes
12220	And they have not got it done.	Yes
13251	Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	Yes
8614	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
24825	This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	No
28698	But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	No
26477	We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	Yes
335	I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	No
21	And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	No
8858	The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	Yes
34057	He lost the Iowa caucus.	Yes
15408	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	No
1912	Number two, let's look at history.	No
148	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	No
12315	China and India were exempted from that treaty.	Yes
361	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	Yes
15911	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
12801	I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	No
31871	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	Yes
26373	He still believes it's a mistake.	No
8083	It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	No
26402	The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	Yes
16288	We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	No
16652	But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	Yes
33279	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	No
8660	Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	No
16923	That, I think, is a good balance.	No
17204	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	No
19413	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	Yes
28780	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	No
28991	There was a chance to get this done.	No
28396	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	No
32416	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	Yes
21980	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	Yes
21423	And everybody says they take responsibility.	No
23373	Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.	No
897	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	No
13257	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	No
22221	But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	No
24413	We're working through the international organizations.	No
29964	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	No
12735	Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	No
21326	And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	Yes
21049	I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	No
7071	They're coming here to work.	No
14534	Term limits for members of the US Congress.	No
27354	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	Yes
27790	They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	Yes
22240	Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	Yes
17275	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	No
27335	There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	No
17226	[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.	Yes
3526	We haven't been paying attention to them.	No
3911	But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	No
26731	The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.	No
9031	I happen to believe it is.	No
7427	And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	No
3653	You've got to look at our record.	No
11751	Well, I mentioned Third World debt.	No
16473	At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	Yes
2924	He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	Yes
1882	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.	Yes
23772	We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.	No
8011	We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	No
3160	This has got to be stopped.	No
13082	I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.	No
26925	And that's what we've done over the last four years.	No
7503	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	No
28683	Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	No
14094	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	No
15773	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	Yes
7886	Let me make my position cl ear.	No
33858	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	No
24627	And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	No
17405	Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	No
23558	Let me make sure you understand my decision.	No
31862	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	Yes
27467	I would indict him for it.	No
9081	We've got to stop drifting.	No
25028	I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	No
639	I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.	No
20125	In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	Yes
1295	We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	Yes
16753	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	Yes
16177	I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	No
24059	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	No
26244	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	No
5793	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	No
26176	This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	Yes
16520	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	No
26810	There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	No
8441	The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	No
24461	Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	No
12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	Yes
315	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	No
24760	Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	No
9302	And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	No
8544	As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	No
24374	We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	Yes
11429	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	No
23452	I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.	No
15705	I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	No
26954	But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	Yes
16990	It's a time for unity.	No
25780	Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	No
3643	It is not a good deal for the American people.	No
6322	And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	No
28233	I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	No
33874	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	Yes
1575	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	No
25617	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	No
12925	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	Yes
21380	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	Yes
32911	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	No
6099	You won't pay a fine, because...	No
26604	It's something you might consider.	No
27581	I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	Yes
18156	What message does that send the Iraqis?	No
19964	Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?	No
28048	It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	Yes
26528	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	No
11027	But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	No
24271	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	Yes
28735	I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	No
17528	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	No
23000	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	No
2365	I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.	No
25245	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	No
30399	.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	No
29634	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	No
12688	It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.	No
19850	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	No
29439	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	No
33632	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	No
17403	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	No
573	I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	No
30367	You have -- wait a minute.	No
25941	They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	Yes
14178	We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	No
28517	Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	No
22177	I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.	No
24467	And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	No
18276	I think it's worthy for a follow-up.	No
22863	Let me talk about North Korea.	No
23994	That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	No
21934	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	No
14932	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	No
22981	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
825	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	No
14629	And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	No
20231	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	Yes
17154	"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	No
264	You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	No
13417	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	Yes
15454	This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	No
23040	And we're doing just that.	No
30202	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	No
24302	And we've focused on the tactical.	No
16378	We can do better than that.	No
9297	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
26391	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	No
13696	I'll give you an example.	No
29041	Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	Yes
13168	We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	No
19138	And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.	No
15520	We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	No
193	So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	No
20671	The warning signs are real.	No
3730	We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.	Yes
9603	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	No
3873	I was honored to speak to those troops.	No
17892	Will our children be better off?	No
24266	We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	Yes
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
30073	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	No
26263	Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.	No
1457	Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.	Yes
29503	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	No
15734	I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	No
26701	Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	No
7134	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	Yes
24437	There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	Yes
13466	I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	Yes
12773	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	No
1174	The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	No
24911	A President is called the Commander in Chief.	No
16143	We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	No
751	That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	No
12889	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	No
641	But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.	No
12782	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	No
25745	I appreciate the quote from the young man.	No
23640	In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	Yes
16390	But we have enormous differences.	No
14566	If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	No
16399	This election is about big things.	No
19010	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	Yes
7803	We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.	No
11688	And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	Yes
11766	I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	No
201	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	Yes
18679	The world is more dangerous.	No
6239	And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	No
12270	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	No
22002	But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	No
28498	You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	Yes
20637	I would take the use of force very seriously.	No
28270	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	No
26728	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	No
28833	This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	No
24749	I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	Yes
23901	I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.	No
7627	I believe we should have a stronger military force.	No
28800	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	No
30387	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	Yes
7958	I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	No
16736	So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	No
33825	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	Yes
8581	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	No
21455	I think you have to look at it.	No
21312	Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.	No
22850	It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	No
24237	But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	No
31996	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	Yes
15621	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	No
13639	We've got to pay it back.	No
22638	Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.	No
7489	And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	No
25945	So you add it up.	No
33823	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	No
16761	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	Yes
29300	Will they raise incomes in America?	No
3750	We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.	Yes
19983	It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	No
16924	But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	No
23167	What means something is: Do you have a plan?	No
13255	I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	No
33313	It means their job is tougher.	No
21089	You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.	No
24605	I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.	No
13369	But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	No
6785	I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	No
24774	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	No
29791	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	Yes
13917	And I got a long history of doing that.	Yes
19259	I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.	Yes
57	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	No
24589	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	No
31983	Mine are words, and his was action.	No
31941	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	No
11825	But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	No
12807	If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	No
19846	I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	No
8125	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
8846	me that the Federal grants that come with.	No
31896	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	No
15663	And in the process the negatives began.	No
14084	We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	Yes
32161	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	Yes
21855	If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	No
20787	As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	Yes
7613	In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	No
21846	A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.	No
8205	What has happened to you?	No
29431	They're going to expand their companies.	No
15748	How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?	No
24818	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	No
3328	And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
27343	States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.	Yes
13932	I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.	No
4350	"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""	Yes
28902	During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.	No
283	But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.	No
23822	This is a movement that came from the people.	No
33030	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	Yes
2095	Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	Yes
26003	Let's talk about them separately.	No
13204	I completely sustained the treaty.	Yes
29344	So is it President Obama's fault?	No
4209	He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	Yes
10975	Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.	No
33739	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	No
3116	Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	Yes
14859	In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	No
29055	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	No
9354	Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	Yes
381	We went out and built housing.	No
6277	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	No
4168	I've known him for 35 years.	No
8216	And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	No
24377	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	Yes
12633	On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	Yes
19044	The military will be an all-volunteer army.	No
290	I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	No
20460	My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.	No
16228	The American people are up to here with debates.	No
22365	I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	No
27601	"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	No
1028	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	No
1843	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	No
8438	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	No
26035	I told them in early '95.	No
19003	I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.	No
2227	That's the plan that I've put forward.	No
28849	Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?	No
29190	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	No
119	He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.	Yes
8526	I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.	No
24505	And he went out and he did it.	No
5703	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	Yes
28685	Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.	No
14939	And my economic plan calls for that.	No
28037	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	No
27246	The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
31864	We had an $800 billion deficit.	Yes
13401	In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	No
15042	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	Yes
141	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	No
7259	That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	No
676	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
26127	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	No
13968	I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	No
20101	When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.	Yes
15248	We have the sources here.	No
22430	I hope I'm that person.	No
21016	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	Yes
5663	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	Yes
17878	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	No
23342	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	Yes
24757	As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.	Yes
13212	"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	No
29584	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	No
13623	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	No
25125	There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	No
17355	They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	Yes
33661	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	Yes
23825	The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	No
2695	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	No
7603	Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	No
5986	It's mortgaging our children's future.	No
17727	That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	No
1171	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	No
13493	If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	No
12709	The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	No
1473	He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.	Yes
29434	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	No
28443	Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	No
13750	I want the line-item veto.	No
20478	It's the right thing for the consumers.	No
25487	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	No
1944	Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	No
15971	Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	No
17471	Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	No
11953	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	No
3895	First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.	No
14765	Who's the best person to get results and not talk?	No
21832	I don't want to stampede.	No
11280	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	No
7281	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	No
13494	Now on the question of gold.	No
33528	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	Yes
15891	I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	No
12464	I'm running to get some things done for America.	No
4090	Now here's what we need to do.	No
25553	But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	No
26524	Now that's not a government takeover.	No
8111	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	No
30118	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	Yes
7193	But let me go a step further.	No
1740	This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	No
19605	We don't know what's going to happen.	No
2657	And by the way, I've had that experience.	No
33148	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	No
6595	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
16657	We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.	Yes
3758	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	No
507	And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	No
5919	They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	No
25462	And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	Yes
25341	And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	No
11071	We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	No
1887	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	No
14962	This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.	No
26349	That was a tax credit for the employer.	No
22594	I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	No
26056	This is the United States of America.	No
13644	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	No
30216	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	Yes
17818	Growth is a little over 3 percent now.	Yes
7645	And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	No
12443	This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.	No
8587	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	Yes
14434	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	Yes
2862	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	No
19658	And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	Yes
22103	I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	No
34229	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	No
20786	$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
913	Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.	Yes
12799	I hope we can succeed.	No
32469	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	Yes
618	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	No
23785	We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	No
13508	Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	No
29566	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	No
12602	It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.	Yes
22219	And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.	No
846	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	No
8140	He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	Yes
22811	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	No
10118	But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	No
14164	I look on this as history.	No
31874	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	No
15342	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	No
1096	And I've told everything I know about it.	No
12127	So it's one of my top priorities.	No
8261	And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	Yes
11563	IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	No
23996	I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.	No
4005	Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	Yes
12828	Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	No
9599	That's not what you did in that generation.	No
18326	"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	Yes
25713	60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	Yes
23650	Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.	No
22113	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	Yes
20998	My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.	No
27560	And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	No
14887	Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	No
12573	First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
17680	I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	No
26068	It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	Yes
15253	We cannot cast aside these regulations.	No
28185	It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	No
6122	So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	No
13224	Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	No
5659	Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	No
12453	I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	Yes
12984	America is not standing still.	No
7112	He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	No
2082	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	No
34318	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	Yes
18707	My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	No
25415	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	No
13522	A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.	Yes
33691	That is not going to work.	No
14868	I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	Yes
23911	Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	No
12017	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	Yes
13890	Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.	No
26405	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	No
29596	And you should go down and take a look at that.	No
6696	A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	Yes
27042	But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	No
3343	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	Yes
26292	The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	Yes
12549	They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	No
7862	Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	No
13759	Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	No
11200	It is the same overall strategy.	No
27530	So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	No
32600	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	No
24297	It's a very unstable situation.	No
28594	You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	No
28842	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	No
18009	This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	No
23584	No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	No
28371	And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	No
16829	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	Yes
19531	They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.	Yes
26258	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	No
4354	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	No
25466	In other words, a President has to make choices.	No
6311	Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	Yes
22129	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	No
24187	The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	No
10475	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	No
8947	Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.	Yes
3777	We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.	No
30124	And I think that's great.	No
24906	A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	No
23242	The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	Yes
16087	I think I've addressed it.	No
15502	And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	No
7061	I see it as a serious problem.	No
21999	Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	No
32165	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	No
15494	We've had great success in my own state.	No
10046	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	No
7721	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	Yes
26933	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	Yes
23203	Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.	No
32761	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	No
11092	And I may have to make those tough decisions.	No
19436	And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	No
17772	Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	No
11166	... to -- to -- to...	No
20105	I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	Yes
26472	But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	No
19493	I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	No
25951	Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	No
1889	But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.	No
26686	Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	Yes
2718	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	No
6636	Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	Yes
18691	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	No
29793	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	No
19786	I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	No
138	So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	No
2320	So what did we do?	No
28487	Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	No
794	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	No
22822	The president did not do what was necessary.	No
15464	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	Yes
9548	And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.	Yes
29240	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	Yes
9600	And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	No
23352	That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	Yes
31852	Well, I actually agree with that.	No
970	We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	No
32710	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	No
14544	And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	No
27261	We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	No
17600	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	No
11363	I believe in its greatness.	No
24162	I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.	No
7998	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	No
19089	And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.	No
3001	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	Yes
11239	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	No
7875	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	Yes
729	We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	No
3903	We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.	No
27090	And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	No
1127	It's a fact they did.	Yes
29390	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	No
10051	But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	Yes
23524	And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	No
13423	He suggested that we aid distressed areas.	No
5837	And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	No
19574	It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	No
9048	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	No
28085	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	No
11873	And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	No
7593	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	No
15757	I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	No
23102	It's in my health-care proposal.	Yes
8826	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.	Yes
2130	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	No
20229	I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.	No
28348	We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	No
24842	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	Yes
11251	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	No
709	And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	No
1543	As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	No
15926	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	No
23695	Now, you asked what mistakes.	No
24585	I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	No
4283	What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	No
14988	"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."""	No
19284	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	No
14277	We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.	Yes
34104	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	No
2002	But you've been -- but you've been president four years...	No
2318	You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	Yes
23230	They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	No
29743	They would have won an appeal.	No
25912	We had to make cuts.	No
24200	Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.	No
10875	The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	Yes
9418	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	No
19562	It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	Yes
22102	New world order to me means freedom and democracy.	No
27285	And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	No
28044	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	No
28981	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	No
20069	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	No
12071	And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	No
891	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	No
11011	That's how in banking it works.	No
16658	But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	Yes
33376	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	Yes
8586	The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.	No
32237	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	No
2510	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	Yes
3963	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	No
20833	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	No
28114	So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	No
25141	Well, the red light went on.	No
12134	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	No
13385	Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	No
5495	And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	No
24920	That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	No
16342	But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	No
3023	Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	Yes
14657	Also I got a philosophical difference.	No
19197	One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	No
7823	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	No
4227	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	No
32926	I'm shocked to hear that.	No
24609	"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	No
13865	Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	No
31978	I'm not proud of it.	No
15673	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	No
12970	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
17478	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	Yes
32322	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	Yes
8211	Now, this is not standing still.	No
93	It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	Yes
15109	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	No
7756	They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	Yes
13458	Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	No
19377	Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	No
26032	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	Yes
7029	He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	No
6506	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	No
26213	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	No
23730	He wants your kids to pay for it.	No
12907	But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	Yes
24555	And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	No
17697	I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	No
12542	Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	No
19207	We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	Yes
7017	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	No
24130	If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.	No
17378	I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	No
26615	Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	Yes
29282	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	Yes
16543	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	Yes
18854	I'm trying to put a leash on them.	No
27231	We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.	Yes
11903	Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	No
17788	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	Yes
34044	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	No
15831	No, let me tell you something about that.	No
15440	I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	No
20907	All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.	No
14409	Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	No
19184	We have the highest foreign debt in history.	Yes
16780	These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.	No
28381	It's just the right position to take.	No
17384	We have, to one-third of what it was.	Yes
33544	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
23222	Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
27143	The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	No
6537	And there is no system.	No
7974	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	No
409	We are serving a million more families now.	Yes
235	Well, we're on the right track.	No
17153	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	No
19178	He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	Yes
8358	I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	No
9067	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	No
8616	As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	No
24672	-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	No
4027	And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.	No
24677	So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --	No
26822	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	No
15784	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	No
12355	Oh, you mean the rules.	No
25864	What service are you in?	No
4038	"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	Yes
25073	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	No
17094	Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	No
10443	And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	No
20359	I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	No
5550	And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.	Yes
1421	Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	Yes
26575	I would be willing to have another debate this year.	No
33989	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	Yes
3365	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	No
15965	And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	No
5523	Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	No
3624	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	No
2321	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	Yes
17560	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	No
12927	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	Yes
6309	Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.	No
7030	That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	Yes
26261	I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	No
23542	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	Yes
8965	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	Yes
18123	And our alliance is strong.	No
18317	And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.	No
14877	Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	No
27480	There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.	No
28960	So this is a show me state.	No
15041	Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	Yes
9725	And the plans that I talked about will create even more.	No
19469	This keeps up with technology.	No
441	And I favor the death penalty.	No
26821	What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.	No
24954	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	No
21341	So what is the answer?	No
23250	Do you know what he presented us with?	No
17893	Are we building the future that this nation needs?	No
21854	I think medical care should go with the person.	No
26503	And I think right now we got to go back.	No
12235	You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.	No
27975	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	No
19195	That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.	Yes
20480	And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	No
3582	Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	Yes
10094	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	No
17762	It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.	No
10129	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	No
12766	America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	No
24921	That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	No
16153	We ought to have rural enterprise zones.	No
16031	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	No
26370	He said it would hurt the economy.	No
13767	I've been speaking out since day 1.	No
1027	Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.	Yes
2000	If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	No
29122	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	No
2334	That's why I'd have regulation.	No
21731	I didn't get to make a comment on this.	No
23305	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	No
16322	and must do what he's talking about now.	No
21645	So you've got to create jobs.	No
5839	And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	No
1936	Number two is to cut spending.	No
16572	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	No
26589	And people have to decide.	No
28116	That's part of an overall overhaul.	No
25346	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
1060	I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	No
15008	And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	No
8341	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	No
3084	And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	No
28688	We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	No
2915	And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	No
27608	But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	No
34340	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	No
20859	Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	No
16466	We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.	No
13921	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	Yes
15346	So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	No
8337	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	No
9177	Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	No
15020	Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	Yes
15660	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	No
2762	I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	No
12590	I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	No
1487	But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	No
3131	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	Yes
16245	So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	No
19695	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	No
11289	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	No
16591	We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	No
16234	But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.	No
32339	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	Yes
4115	"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	No
17182	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	Yes
610	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	No
27382	Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	No
27310	They're still number one today.	Yes
13137	This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	No
29382	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	No
6800	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	No
24134	I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	No
20160	And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.	No
28445	I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	No
14956	And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.	Yes
29942	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	No
17521	I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	No
1461	One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	No
24051	I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	No
25039	And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.	No
590	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	Yes
27160	I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	No
23839	I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	No
10130	They're using cheap hand guns.	Yes
18334	My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	Yes
17023	Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	Yes
9822	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	Yes
3341	One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	Yes
7136	We're not allowed to vote on it.	Yes
181	More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.	Yes
11400	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	No
