29266	I believe that Senator Obama's lack of understanding and experience in various areas, including his initial response to the Russian invasion and aggression in Georgia, as well as his stubbornness about proving his mistake during the election, indicates that we need more flexibility from our president.	No
31302	Suppose we had exited at that moment.	No
30334	We must take all necessary measures to prevent genocide, even if it means taking steps to avoid these terrible catastrophes.	No

30681	It is not an overnight occurrence, but it must happen gradually as progress in arms negotiation, control, and reduction takes place.	No

29687	In America, 20% of the upper-class individuals pay around 80% of taxes due to the organization of tax cuts.	Yes
30296	Thank you for your question.	No
30205	Never has Senator Obama confronted his party leaders on any one topic.	Yes
30374	It would bring about a significant shift in the local community.	No

29275	I want to extend my thanks to Bob, please.	No
24495	The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.	Yes
28956	I promise you I will keep mine.	No

29963	There has been no growth in coal production or employment opportunities.	Yes
31341	If you're considering implementing a voucher program in Missouri, it's fine.	No
29160	That can be demonstrated by the fact that one in six people are poor.	Yes
6701	I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.	No
29320	Our plan is to confiscate Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and then allow him to distribute the wealth.	No
11130	And that is to get the support of the people.	No
30811	It is true, based on the information provided by the referees regarding employment and economic growth, that we would incur an additional $60 billion in expenses during fiscal year 2017 compared to the current year.	Yes
29468	It should be noted by me that he has made mistakes on several foreign policy and national security issues, which is his natural skill.	No
31200	We have a positive outlook due to our diversity.	No
26145	But we have to prove we can pay for them.	No
29905	A salary in the range of $20,000 per year can result in an additional $122 being earned.	Yes
10451	The middle-class need a rescue package.	No
15646	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	No

30574	It was my belief that that was the topic of our interest.	No
9592	And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.	No
31235	I am not fond of observing the people in a declining economy and country because our government has lost touch with them.	No

29575	Yet another example of the eloquence demonstrated by Senator Obama.	No
29358	The adoption of a culture and ethic of responsibility is necessary for everyone, including corporations, the federal government, and individuals who may be living in poverty.	No
29901	Governments are taking $0.44 from every dollar they earn, which is a problem caused by pre-emptive actions taken by the Federal Government and cities.	Yes
29602	It is possible that the most significant risk we could face in the future is to adopt the same flawed policies and politics that we have witnessed over the past eight years and somehow anticipate a different outcome.	No
29146	Corporate welfare costs $4 billion each year for oil industry employees.	Yes
30315	Our expenditure has approached almost $700 billion, and if we persist with our current trajectory, Senator McCain's statement suggests that it will surpass $1 trillion.	Yes
29018	I am willing to assist the governor.	No
30312	We must provide them with the means to accomplish it.	No

29250	Our yearly outlay of $700 billion is being sent to countries that do not reciprocate our approach.	Yes

30988	"""Is it worth the effort?"""	No
31071	I think experience is important, but it's not the sole factor.	No
9897	Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.	Yes
30035	That is something I am capable of achieving.	No
8188	Is the United States standing still?	No
31353	The president's responsibility to select you is not the same as yours, and it'll be incorrect.	No

29684	I want to get America back on the road.	No
29264	I don't think Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience to make such mistakes, especially in his initial response to the Russian invasion and aggression in Georgia. His stubbornness to admit that he was wrong about the surge highlights the need for more flexibility in a president.	No

30414	Our yearly expenditure for uninsured individuals in Texas has reached $4.7 billion.	Yes
24827	He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway.	Yes
17550	In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.	Yes
30320	It is my belief that intervening should be considered as a part of our interests and those of the nation, where possible.	No
30553	I have incorporated women, qualified black individuals, and Spanish citizens who were previously excluded into the White House, executive branch administrative offices, or judicial systems.	Yes

30974	Training is all that is required for them.	No
29335	America's tax rate for businesses is 35 percent.	Yes
5491	Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.	No
6963	There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.	No

29635	126 times, you cast your vote in favor of tax reduction after they proposed it.	Yes
30777	I am of the opinion that nuclear power is both clean and safe.	No
30950	I backed the '76 initiative that he mentioned, as we were facing a severe economic downturn and required some encouragement.	Yes
31174	It's become too much.	No
29877	The most important thing is to not allow any dollar to be spent on something that could have been better spent by the people.	No
31183	It appears that these aged boys will not quit easily.	No
29336	The business tax rate in the United States must be reduced.	No
29966	I don't think the American people hold that view.	No
29304	I will not endorse a tax increase for small business earnings.	No
9829	Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.	Yes
30116	It's time to start building jobs in this area.	No
29650	I've passed 56 individual bills, which I wrote myself and have also made amendments to some bills that were not under my name.	Yes

29879	The Kerr bill provided for the benefit of all individuals who were not on Social Security.	Yes
29582	It is my opinion that we should acknowledge and reward these skilled educators.	No
5779	And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.	No
31109	What is the purpose of doing it?	No
29753	It wasn't just that I found her captivating, but it also evoked feelings of love at first sight.	No
9355	And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.	Yes
30806	In August 1974, when Mr. Ford became president, he first requested a $4.7 billion tax increase for his constituents in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the 1940s.	Yes
30166	We are tasked with finding a solution.	No
29457	Joe Biden is one of the most outstanding public servants in this country, according to my assessment.	No
31268	The world's longest-lasting elderly life is in the United States.	Yes
30864	Over a period of 4 years, they have missed the mark by almost $600 billion.	Yes
30341	The objective is to obtain the backing of the public.	No
16408	And I ask for your support on November 8th.	No
30093	My goal is to ensure that we comprehend the information.	No
29052	You cannot allow terrorists to compromise.	No
10605	When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.	Yes
30779	I am one of the few who believe that we can do it.	No

29087	In the past month, we've experienced a net loss of sixty-three thousand jobs.	Yes
29276	The current state of Americans' pain is causing them to feel angry.	No
5589	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	Yes
29473	His vote resulted in him losing the first Gulf War.	Yes
29692	To ensure economic growth, we cannot simply raise taxes on small business owners.	No
16093	But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.	No
30173	Tom suggests that the first requirement is for a person to be someone who immediately associates with and can be trusted.	No
5783	Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.	No
24648	Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive.	Yes
10629	Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.	Yes

30409	Consequently, the bill is passed by Congress after our session in 1997 ended, and we then passed an enabling legislation in 1999.	No
30560	The concept of controlling nuclear weapons has been supported by every President since Harry Truman.	Yes
30048	We succeeded in preserving 1,000 jobs.	Yes

30754	Don't you think it's the end of the story? (Laughter, applause)	No
30992	The six-party talks will cease once we resume bilateral discussions.	No
29654	I take great pride in that accomplishment.	No
29925	Mr. President, thank you for participating in this debate.	No
15933	The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.	Yes
30181	Concerning Fannie Mae, Senator McCain failed to mention that the bill he mentioned was not his own proposal.	Yes
6289	So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.	No
30275	We can do it, but we must make a financial commitment.	No
29940	This is the highest level of natural gas production in several decades.	Yes
30406	It's my view that it'll be a private matter.	No

29103	We have achieved a reduction of over 50% in inflation.	Yes
7517	And God bless the United States of America.	No
30823	A single agency was responsible for drug treatment within the Georgia government.	Yes
30242	The American people were not anticipating such a call to service.	No
29438	We are doing it and I hope.	No
30529	We've also reduced inflation.	Yes
30947	I'll disclose what I believe has been the most outrageous thing that has ever happened in political debates, including this campaign and the 1982 one.	No
24256	I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.	No

30894	The truth is that less than 1% of the 270,000 government loans farmers have faced foreclosures.	Yes
10608	And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.	Yes
31182	The old boys are not going to quit easily.	No
30419	The reason Senator Eisenhower was correct in his policy towards the Formosa Straits is that he refused to follow Senator Kennedy's recommendations, including those on cutting off free territory and leaving it to the Communists.	Yes
5570	Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?	No
29016	Boston harbor and that answer were equally evident.	No
29740	Does it seem obvious to you that the United States spends $73 billion annually to assist 10 million low- and middle-class individuals in obtaining college financial aid?	Yes

29420	Since Watergate, Senator Obama's campaign has spent more money than ever before.	Yes
1128	But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.	No
10574	I think it depends on what we do.	No
30541	It has reached 12.7%.	Yes
16075	Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income.	Yes
12832	I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.	No
29381	I aim to ensure that we are concentrating on programs that are effective.	No
30739	I propose moving forward with my plans for ethanol, which would involve the use of more corn to expand the market.	Yes

30280	He opposed alternative fuels 23 times during that period.	Yes
23971	I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions.	Yes
31260	What did we obtain as a result?	No
31130	A robust jobs program is necessary before anything else.	No

30972	He is convinced that the Iraqi people deserve freedom.	No
30883	It appears to me that a brief glance can shed light on why the United States Senate rejected this amendment, as it will be detrimental to our country's tradition of honest faith through its political politicization.	No
31197	Our team's unity is the reason why we should love each other.	No
17287	When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.	Yes
30313	The time and resources must be provided for them to do it.	No
3369	I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.	No

29088	Our job losses in the past month have been totalled out to 160,000.	Yes
29824	Despite the fact that almost six million Americans receive food of five cents per person, it is not clear to me if an extra dollar amount is enough.	Yes
29498	Senator Obama, who has never crossed the border, is against the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.	Yes

30810	I think it's correct to say that the committees you referred to have been informed about the employment figures and economy growth, with projections suggesting an increase of $60 billion in spending over five years.	Yes
29448	It is necessary to examine all of these things.	No
