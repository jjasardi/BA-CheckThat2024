17274	I am a son of a Methodist minister.	No
7340	If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?	No
17550	In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.	Yes
10555	Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.	Yes
29055	We've been sailing around the world with Navy nuclear power plants on board for 60 years.	Yes
16131	It's a contract between generations.	No

12606	And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.	Yes

18509	"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""	No
14911	We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.	Yes

28777	He is the chairman of the health committee.	No
5577	Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...	No
5571	Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.	No
6776	It's between a woman, God and her doctor.	No
3579	Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.	No
5582	I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.	No
17749	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	No
4275	So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...	No
9247	We've also got to look to the future.	No
15416	I've been President now for almost four years.	No
4398	And that's going to be my job.	No

24077	Why do we have to do it?	No
16699	Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field.	No
26344	Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.	Yes

5609	But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.	No
24031	I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts.	No
10889	We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.	No
9952	Mr. President, let me finish.	No
27094	We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.	No

1517	We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.	Yes
9503	The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.	Yes
6168	I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.	No
27683	They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.	No
9731	We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.	Yes
10685	And we can do it.	No
19262	But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.	No
7454	I love the strong women around me.	No
16579	But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.	No
15462	We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.	Yes
6287	Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.	No
5641	But -- OK. All right.	No
11327	But here's what I do know.	No
5487	Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.	No
16047	And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.	No
1943	What things would I cut from spending?	No
5990	But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.	Yes
7944	We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.	Yes
10040	Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.	No

7836	Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.	Yes
10970	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?	No
15084	That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.	No
13002	It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.	No
8605	The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.	Yes
25561	I would like to see their elimination.	No
13361	My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.	Yes
1686	"I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, ""I've been out of work since May."	No
7747	Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.	No
24648	Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive.	Yes
16233	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	No

26039	American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.	Yes
13187	What do we do then?	No

9694	President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.	No
7517	And God bless the United States of America.	No
16402	America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible.	No
10901	By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.	No

16782	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	Yes
24306	So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.	No
27519	And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.	No
17855	But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.	Yes
6079	The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.	Yes

29020	The economic growth rate has decreased by less than half compared to the beginning of this year.	Yes
29013	Over the past eight years, we have accumulated more debt than all the presidents of the United States, from George Washington to Jimmy Carter.	Yes
14925	It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.	Yes
23971	I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions.	Yes
8164	That is the obligation upon our generation.	No
10730	That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.	No
5625	I mentioned health care earlier.	No
29046	Upon his election as President, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was slightly over $5 trillion.	Yes
6247	Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.	No
5907	Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.	No
1263	Let me uh - speak out very strongly.	No
9630	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	No
27828	You can take a look at the op-ed...	No
5496	But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.	No
6658	"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"	No
9656	Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.	Yes
9835	And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.	Yes
10275	The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.	No

131	Let me help the governor.	No
12780	What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.	Yes
10713	I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.	No
29062	It's worth noting that the typical policy costs around $12,000.	Yes
10952	Well, thank you for the question.	No
17695	I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.	No
5655	I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.	No
17389	I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.	Yes
15167	To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.	No
8353	Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.	No
7657	Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.	No
28918	But I'm not proud of any record, sir, I'm not.	No
5936	Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.	No
5565	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.	No
11112	And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.	No
28710	I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter.	No
4390	And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.	No
3975	But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.	No
26564	Those are my best ideas about it.	No
5570	Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?	No
14926	It is now running at 12.7%.	Yes
1674	And I'm looking forward to having that debate.	No
13346	The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.	No
10978	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	No
15648	It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country.	No
13003	And this means more than what we've been doing.	No
23421	China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.	Yes
14890	In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.	Yes
24429	But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.	Yes
5788	And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.	No
10692	We do need to look at our records.	No
29031	Since the establishment of Israel two decades ago, we have provided the Israelis with more than 45 percent of total economic and military aid.	Yes
28958	He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.	Yes
9929	He was asked this on Univision the other day.	No
14892	In addition, we've brought down inflation.	Yes
816	And I think it's important to understand what happened here.	No
16320	So I am one who believes that we can	No
5608	Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.	Yes
11676	I don't think we agree on that.	No
6667	And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	No
15632	I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.	No
24863	And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job.	No
24794	It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.	No
29043	As a president, I believe that the proper structure of the $750 billion rescue package will ensure taxpayers' money back, which is crucial for the American people to understand.	Yes
9733	Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.	Yes
15689	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	No
29049	The last two budgets he supported had an additional $24 billion in spending beyond what the Bush administration proposed.	Yes
7923	On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.	No
21954	Therefore, you don't know what's it like.	No
8319	I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.	No
7023	I have a plan to put America back to work.	No
15933	The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.	Yes
6107	So here's what we do.	No
16075	Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income.	Yes
10659	I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.	No
15750	So military security and economic security go hand in hand.	No
29037	Fannie and Freddie Mae's subprime lending situation was the catalyst for the housing market collapse in America.	Yes
17434	As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.	Yes
9367	I don't think the American people believe that.	No
9017	On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.	Yes
1571	I was a school board member, and a library board member.	No
1037	We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.	Yes
8437	My objection here is not the cost in dollars.	No
29016	Welfare recipients who use welfare, housing, Medicaid, and food stamps laws earn more than $10 thousand annually and are not required to pay taxes.	Yes
23865	We need a new approach.	No
10461	And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question.	No
6139	I want to leave money in your pocket.	No
7319	Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.	No
18380	I understand how hard it is.	No
11278	And thank you for your service to the country.	No
18074	It's the hardest decision a president makes.	No
1596	Now I don't know all the answers.	No
5559	And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.	No
10634	I don't expect you to watch every vote.	No
15027	I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.	Yes
29025	By utilizing the money, we were able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600 and provide them with preventive care that will ultimately save money throughout the system.	Yes
6135	This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.	No
8597	But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.	No
9640	An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.	Yes
16847	So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?	No
15905	But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.	No
9396	And I intend to win it as President of the United States.	No
24577	We are being murdered economically because we have too many drop-outs, we have too many low birthweight babies, we have too many drug addicts as kids, we have too much violence, we are too divided by race, by income, by region.	No
2879	And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.	Yes
5493	They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.	No
10494	But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.	No
13303	On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.	No
7021	And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
9083	A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.	No
7394	And people all find their ways to express it.	No
9475	Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.	Yes
16256	(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?	No
10859	Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?	No
16101	You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.	No
21704	Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.	Yes
15937	See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel.	No
5683	When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.	Yes
6219	Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.	Yes
24255	In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right.	No
28297	More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.	Yes
2453	And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.	Yes
26228	We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.	Yes
9487	It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.	No
3024	We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.	Yes
7600	In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.	Yes
1600	We might have to do it slowly.	No
9457	Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?	No
6000	And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.	Yes
5711	He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.	Yes
5562	Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy.	Yes
15842	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	No
14752	Then the question is, can we govern?	No
16263	But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.	No
24992	What did we get for it?	No
5773	So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.	No
10060	Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.	Yes
27185	And, finally, we have to stand by our principles.	No
29050	During your debate with Senator Clinton, you didn't tell the American people the truth because you were caught on camera negotiating with John McCain about public funding.	Yes
28143	I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works.	No
5502	Now, I know the criticism of this.	No
27107	You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.	Yes
1546	We have cut inflation by better than half.	Yes
15686	I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better.	No
11313	Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.	Yes
6338	We need to have transparency.	No
17485	But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.	No
13388	I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.	No
29061	You will be imposing taxation on health care benefits for the first time in history.	Yes
19417	And I hope we can do better.	No
28349	I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.	No
5779	And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.	No
29060	Among the most troubling statistics is the increase in obesity among young Americans.	Yes
28664	I know this, 100% will get it if I'm the president.	No
11072	And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.	No
16631	In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.	Yes
5713	So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama.	No
10899	I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.	No
29036	Due to his lack of faith in a timetable, Senator McCain opposed the funding for troops provided by such legislation.	Yes
5778	"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."	Yes
17111	And so, I think that the lines can meet.	No
17721	There's no way of glossing around that.	No
228	I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.	Yes
24553	We are all in this together.	No
9829	Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.	Yes
16015	He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.	Yes
15597	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	No
7471	And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.	No
9704	He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.	Yes
7143	We also need to hold on to equal pay.	No
29027	One in six people living in poverty serves as evidence.	Yes
12701	He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.	Yes
10338	I care about our kids.	No
10719	And, by the way, I want to go back a second.	No
17121	As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.	Yes
24610	"Call me, let me know."""	No
6399	In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.	No
23088	And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time.	Yes
24246	I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.	No
7180	Is that a new question or a 30-second question?	No
24087	(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.	No
8778	When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.	Yes
6291	Look, we must improve education in this country.	No
24426	We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.	No
29021	The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines have been reduced in size from three million to two million.	Yes
15626	As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that.	Yes
24050	I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.	No
11240	The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.	No
29017	Mr. Maynard stated that the gun control program does not demonstrate any decrease in crime rate or criminal activity based on the registration of firearms or gun owners.	Yes
8468	Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.	Yes
29018	It should be noted that the United States' economic recovery from a year ago is significantly stronger than any other major free industrial nation in the world.	Yes
29048	Twice, he supported a budget proposal that raises the taxes of those earning $42,000 annually.	Yes
24358	And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush.	Yes
16014	I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year.	Yes
12540	That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.	Yes
9635	I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.	Yes
18120	They just need the help to be trained.	No
1502	That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.	No
15418	I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.	No
24495	The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.	Yes
8310	In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.	No
29052	A recent poll conducted by your network and the American people indicates that 2 out of 3 Americans believe Senator McCain is running a campaign against the president.	Yes
24559	Our diversity is a strength.	No
20870	Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.	No
8411	As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.	Yes
16528	I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.	Yes
17655	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	Yes
7871	I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.	No
10737	We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.	No
12157	I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.	Yes
9874	There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.	Yes
29034	The size of government has been the largest since the Great Society, and we have taken charge of it now.	Yes
29024	$4 billion is the annual amount paid by the oil industry to corporations for corporate welfare.	Yes
7142	What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.	No
10959	Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.	No
15801	These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.	No
24294	That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.	No
1669	I've got a different view.	No
6720	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	Yes
27688	Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	No
7586	There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.	Yes
29056	Our oil reserves are limited to only 3-4 percent of the world's, and we consume approximately 25 percent.	Yes
13521	Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.	Yes
17681	Certainly education and training is crucial.	No
9009	Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.	Yes
5692	And let me tell you...	No
12922	If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.	No
26145	But we have to prove we can pay for them.	No
16853	And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.	Yes
28956	I promise you I will keep mine.	No
8222	What kind of programs are we for?	No
16276	Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.	No
6276	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	No
29042	In the United States, we pay a 35 percent tax on business transactions.	Yes
28394	This is a fair plan.	No
21636	They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.	No
7524	"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. """	No
6141	That's what I'm all about.	No
9724	Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.	Yes
16187	That boo was excessively loud.	No
12832	I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.	No
24466	But it's gotten too much.	No
7653	Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.	No
29038	It is clear to everyone that we are currently undergoing the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
15565	And they know who appropriates the money.	No
3111	I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.	No
24364	If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.	No
17898	Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?	No
7994	You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.	Yes
24819	And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.	No
12609	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	Yes
11191	We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.	No
7049	But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.	No
5614	So let me get to that.	No
12145	And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.	No
7236	There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.	No
28356	The Senate Budget Committee --	No
28438	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.	No
8612	The means are at issue.	No
4202	But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.	No
15989	But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.	No
10863	Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.	Yes
17649	We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.	Yes
3694	We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.	No
893	I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.	No
3029	Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.	No
6992	And that's what we're going to do.	No
17331	It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.	No
7141	One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.	Yes
15763	Can we start the clock over?	No
25957	Marijuana use is up 141percent.	Yes
18007	People out there listening know what I believe.	No
29047	We are currently grappling with a deficit of over 500 trillion dollars.	Yes
29051	Since Watergate, Senator Obama's campaign has spent more money than ever before.	Yes
7349	Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?	Yes
7033	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	Yes
19924	Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.	Yes
11351	There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.	No
11204	We have to do a lot of things.	No
16410	Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World.	No
8668	What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.	Yes
16316	I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power.	No
18589	He's a brave, brave man.	No
9623	I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.	Yes
6882	But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.	Yes
24450	I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents.	No
29011	Well, can I answer that?	No
10586	And we've got to give them a chance.	No
6721	He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.	Yes
13198	But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.	No
13144	Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.	No
18117	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	No
17034	We must make this next century the century of the individual.	No
10276	And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president.	Yes
16882	But I think the feeling is misplaced.	No
5975	Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.	Yes
10699	That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.	No
23855	And we have to change in this country.	No
9461	And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.	No
2842	I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.	No
5506	And so we've got to reverse this.	No
11299	It would be a game-changer in the region.	No
10386	And I want to fight for them.	No
219	The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?	No
10333	Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it.	No
1746	Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.	Yes
13129	The treaty does not include these two islands.	Yes
7981	But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.	Yes
7512	I ask you for your trust.	No
24639	Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness.	No
16615	The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.	Yes
9897	Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.	Yes
15491	And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.	No
29012	The world's cocaine supply is currently at 50 percent.	Yes
6344	And we'll care for these young children.	No
16340	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.	No
11354	I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business.	No
11333	And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?	No
3384	Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.	Yes
11145	It'd be fine with me.	No
6993	We're going to protect Social Security.	No
16275	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	No
6120	For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.	Yes
10720	Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time.	No
6121	By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.	Yes
12591	In 1957 I was in Havana.	No
5491	Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.	No
9796	He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.	Yes
726	He's got to get this thing more clear.	No
5738	Let me just say, Bob.	No
24166	No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.	No
7336	Now, let me just share something.	No
2148	And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.	Yes
9292	I'll get America and North America energy independent.	No
9591	Well, Katherine, that's a great question.	No
10469	Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.	No
6057	The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.	No
10629	Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.	Yes
18918	Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.	Yes
29044	We're unable to control government spending, leaving our children with an unsettled $10 trillion debt and a half-trillion dollars in outstanding debts to China.	Yes
5783	Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.	No
6910	If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.	No
29054	The first Gulf War was opposed by him through his vote.	Yes
28739	We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.	No
20717	When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.	No
5894	And the facts are facts and records are records.	No
28598	Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me.	No
3896	Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.	Yes
24711	What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs.	No
11080	And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.	No
28261	If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.	No
27503	And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.	No
6402	And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.	No
19641	And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.	Yes
29026	The increase in health care premiums over the past two years has not been as rapid as it was 50 years ago.	Yes
3555	I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.	No
10472	We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.	No
24554	We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose.	No
11070	Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.	Yes
9294	We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.	No
7847	Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.	No
11065	And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.	No
10372	I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.	No
21947	I was in the Lomax AME Church.	No
5594	Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes.	No
24537	Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime.	Yes
12246	And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.	Yes
5542	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.	Yes
10967	I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	No
6665	I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.	No
6946	Americans ought to have it too.	No
5665	Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...	Yes
29015	The federal government allocates 7% of the total for education, while state and local governments are responsible for 93 percent of it.	Yes
1036	We can also have a- an end to the extremes.	No
29057	A trade agreement has been put in place with South Korea, which is causing the import of hundreds of thousands of cars into the United States.	Yes
15789	We were proud of them.	No
24544	That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.	No
2888	I am a graduate of the U.S.	No
11357	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	No
27106	Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.	No
26982	But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.	No
3073	I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.	No
10464	It's our job to fix the problem.	No
1576	I was Governor of Georgia for four years.	No
12885	We can make it move.	No
5863	"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection."""	Yes
8255	Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.	No
17509	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	No
5774	This is a tough campaign.	No
2971	The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.	Yes
10882	And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.	Yes
17523	But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?	No
16857	Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.	Yes
17110	At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.	Yes
6483	Freedom is on the march.	No
1459	In the last month, we've had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs.	Yes
7082	I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.	No
129	That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.	No
6289	So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.	No
6022	So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.	Yes
7789	We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.	Yes
17810	I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.	Yes
9333	I'm happy to answer the question.	No
543	The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.	Yes
17506	You've got another life involved.	No
8928	And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.	Yes
29040	An extra $4 billion in tax benefits would be provided to oil companies, including Exxon Mobil.	Yes
15874	We may have different approaches.	No
24352	Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it.	Yes
17667	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	No
8136	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.	No
10088	Can you say that a little louder, Candy?	No
19059	I appreciate your listening tonight.	No
10682	So we've got to deal with that right away.	No
10794	So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.	No
11074	Well, let me just follow up, my friends.	No
5949	He voted against the first Gulf War.	Yes
13206	I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.	No
8422	Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?	No
10753	Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.	Yes
15731	Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.	No
9867	I want it to be streamlined.	No
5527	And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.	No
27385	Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.	Yes
16467	Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.	No
23821	I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money.	Yes
16388	Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.	No
17646	On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.	Yes
9992	And we want to encourage that.	No
27100	And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.	No
9818	The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.	Yes
16692	The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.	Yes
5996	But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.	No
9128	Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.	No
16236	But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.	No
24496	But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs.	No
9984	I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.	No
10574	I think it depends on what we do.	No
3595	The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.	No
1698	Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.	No
5871	Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.	No
6019	But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.	No
2136	My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.	No
17619	You can't wish it away.	No
29030	Iran will need to acquire eighty F-14s before we can comply with our Air Force's request for F-l4s.	Yes
7583	Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.	No
9395	And we need to win that future.	No
3321	It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.	No
24767	We got the most expensive health care system in the world; it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy, and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality.	Yes
17219	We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.	Yes
3130	In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.	Yes
17692	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	Yes
6073	We need to put health care records online.	No
3110	In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.	No
24117	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	No
17476	This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.	No
11210	We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.	No
16392	I want to invest in our children.	No
18768	The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.	No
202	I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.	No
28900	And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.	No
1537	That uh - situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America.	No
29058	It is only feasible to bring 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.	Yes
5830	But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.	No
10630	And we need to reform.	No
16093	But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.	No
5503	Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?	No
24256	I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.	No
10892	I'm just trying to keep up with John.	No
17000	In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration.	No
24694	Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare.	Yes
11081	But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.	No
29063	In the United States, the typical cost of a health care insurance plan is $5,800.	Yes
2855	We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.	No
5643	Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence.	No
15938	I served at the UN.	No
5552	Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	Yes
14933	We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.	No
27986	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	Yes
16227	I will not agree to another debate.	No
15987	The Congress is doing a better job of it.	No
24821	I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.	Yes
5815	You've got to read what he said...	No
15751	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
15682	It's our vision of America.	No
24683	This is a town where the White House says, Congress did it; Congress says, the White House did it.	No
6087	Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.	No
29023	The cost of healthcare has risen by $2,500 per family.	Yes
28369	I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.	No
6002	We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.	Yes
10102	I'm happy to have a longer conversation --	No
3423	Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.	No
24853	We don't need to do that any more.	No
2156	But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.	No
3436	Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.	No
9817	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	Yes
10955	And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.	No
5589	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	Yes
24752	We can do better, and we must.	No
23906	It's a question of character and judgment.	No
23993	And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man.	No
15222	We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.	Yes
6917	Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.	Yes
10822	Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.	Yes
15570	And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them	No
23743	Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much.	No
8551	Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.	Yes
16017	We do not have to do it.	No
5512	I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
5993	We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.	No
5941	I agree with that, John.	No
10615	We are mortgaging our children's future.	No
1582	We don't have good health care.	No
6131	The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800.	Yes
6701	I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.	No
5864	So all of these things need to be examined, of course.	No
10605	When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.	Yes
15602	The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.	No
8460	And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.	Yes
16502	When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.	Yes
23824	Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature.	No
10261	OK. We need to create jobs here.	No
15947	We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.	No
15829	I had something very nice to say in there.	No
10771	I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad.	No
10043	And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.	No
11665	I thought that was a good model.	No
16116	I just have to correct the record.	No
9063	I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.	No
6080	We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.	No
10359	I will get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
5654	Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.	Yes
7351	I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.	Yes
826	You cannot make concessions to terrorists.	No
7722	Let me s- look also at what I did.	No
6215	And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.	No
13149	There have been many wars in the history of mankind.	No
5827	We do and I hope...	No
6596	When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.	Yes
29019	In the past month, we've experienced a net loss of sixty-three thousand jobs.	Yes
9836	Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.	Yes
7539	I want to thank you for listening tonight.	No
11049	We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.	Yes
6986	The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.	Yes
18933	My opponent opposed the missile defenses.	Yes
5948	But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.	No
17159	Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.	No
24138	So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant.	No
1406	Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.	No
9535	Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.	Yes
9170	And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.	Yes
3583	Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?	No
16828	Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.	No
1466	The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year.	Yes
11132	And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.	No
3695	And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.	No
12613	But are we doing enough in these areas?	No
17287	When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.	Yes
27391	Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.	Yes
15409	I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.	No
24790	I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people.	No
15646	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	No
8239	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	No
29028	The fact that other European countries had already backed the democratic forces in Portugal has led to our weakening of our NATO position, as we have been holding onto their dictatorships for longer than any other democracies in the world.	Yes
12736	So that is my answer to this question.	No
5498	The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.	Yes
10687	So that would be priority number one.	No
10448	And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.	Yes
3698	So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.	No
15641	But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.	No
6903	But I got a better plan.	No
28798	Quotas are bad for America.	No
16099	We're going to tell you how to do it all.	No
2055	The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.	Yes
6194	Now I would not provide a litmus test.	No
6542	We're going to make it affordable and accessible.	No
6881	I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.	Yes
16332	I believe that public service is honorable.	No
5685	And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.	Yes
18410	It's what leadership is based on.	No
5780	Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.	Yes
1260	And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.	No
24529	I'm very proud of him.	No
16307	Maybe the Vice President has an answer.	No
9243	We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.	Yes
8876	We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.	Yes
19006	The issue is what you do about it.	No
6392	And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.	No
5630	And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.	No
6179	Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.	Yes
1311	I would not work hard to support any of those.	No
10803	Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.	Yes
1554	I love America just as all of you love America.	No
24209	But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.	No
10437	Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question.	No
27815	My dad was head of a car company.	No
11130	And that is to get the support of the people.	No
29045	Nearly $1 billion in pork barrel earmark projects have been requested by Senator Obama...	Yes
11203	We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.	No
11266	And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.	Yes
6213	We have to change the culture of America.	No
17686	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	No
16600	We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.	No
9164	Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.	No
10799	Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.	Yes
10874	And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.	No
18859	And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.	No
26076	We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.	Yes
9693	Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	No
16988	But I think it's time to talk about the future.	No
