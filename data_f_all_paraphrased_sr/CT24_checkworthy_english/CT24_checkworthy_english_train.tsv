14673	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	Yes
33686	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	No
10335	In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	No
27396	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	No
22631	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	No

23870	Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	No
9174	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	No
12926	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	Yes

19517	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	Yes
20111	We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	Yes
35264	As I mentioned earlier, the discussion about transferring Medicaid to states may involve a 30 percent decrease in Medicaid coverage over time.	Yes
33860	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	No

25617	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	No
24453	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	No
14177	One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	Yes
443	But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	No
668	Look at the INF treaty.	No
3715	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	Yes
33255	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	Yes
12599	Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?	Yes
34302	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	Yes
20707	I think that's an important part of leadership.	No
17042	I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	No
25190	Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	No
17365	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	No
19551	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	Yes
26317	I'm going to keep my word to you.	No
16442	First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.	No
15047	But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	No
14949	most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	No
7697	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	No
6793	That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	No
10095	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	No
28959	But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	Yes
23483	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	No
32235	You're going to have plans...	No
17904	When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.	Yes
34121	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	No
18218	America needed to be safe.	No
35625	According to him, the amount is $800 billion, while we equate it to $600 billion.	Yes
22319	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	No
24289	I hope we can talk more about that.	No
3267	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	No
13752	And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.	No
2718	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	No
9899	And that's what we've done.	No
18019	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	Yes
29941	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	Yes
27573	But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	No
16037	One I don't have a list yet.	No
15165	unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	No
20058	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	No
21697	Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	Yes
17217	We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.	No
7109	Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	No
7018	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	No
35415	They have reduced their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	Yes
16650	Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.	No
28955	We both made promises in this campaign.	No
2077	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	Yes
3173	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	Yes
13293	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	No
33167	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	No
28917	I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	No
24237	But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	No
16569	I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	Yes
1684	This is obviously a very tender topic.	No
3977	So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	No
17143	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	Yes
25508	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	Yes
28700	I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	No
35910	The highest number ever recorded this year will be achieved next year and for the tenth year in a row.	Yes
19140	We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
1441	Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.	Yes
15314	Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.	No
34775	Some in the country lack the motivation to fight it, while those who are on the front line, as you know, have a strong connection to law enforcement and some of them are fighting hard to keep their lives safe.	Yes
29793	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	No
17779	And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	No
2444	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	No
30262	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	Yes
872	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	No
24436	But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	No
18817	We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	Yes
19930	Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	No
32968	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	No
28741	And that is the current campaign financing system.	No
34621	Our largest agricultural importer of our products, Colombia, has already paid billions in expenses to our businesses for the goods and products we send there, thanks to previous agreements made by President Clinton.	Yes
2223	But people make their own choice.	No
18906	The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	Yes
23670	Put a head fake on us.	No
28521	I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	No
13806	But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.	No
18426	Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	No
1165	At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	No
2006	It's now four years later.	No
29150	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	Yes
20162	And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	Yes
20359	I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	No
8662	The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.	No
34803	Those who invest in small businesses and hold the investment for five years can now benefit from capital gains.	Yes
35852	I was mistaken in my belief that the economy would be positively impacted by the tax compromise and Democratic tax increase.	Yes
19745	Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	No
22130	All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	Yes
33884	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	Yes
32234	We're going to be able to.	No
22120	The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	Yes
23197	I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	Yes
22968	I'm going to change that.	No
26955	And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.	No
29411	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	No
2900	And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	Yes
32746	... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	Yes
34577	My appointment history shows that I've appointed more than 130 people.	Yes
4121	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	No
2991	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	No
23613	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	No
12141	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	Yes
28253	I think that's a mistake.	No
35504	Six other studies have analyzed the study you describe and concluded that it is entirely incorrect.	Yes
34688	We are now defending ourselves.	Yes
2592	The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	Yes
33983	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
4179	I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	No
28197	The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	Yes
11493	The sanctions are being violated.	Yes
6575	He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	Yes
13866	They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	No
4091	We do need tougher sanctions.	No
10548	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	No
10160	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	Yes
11768	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	No
25698	But in any event, I understand the problems.	No
27028	...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	No
22811	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	No
34955	We discovered that those with 185 percent of poverty were receiving government assistance.	Yes
34602	There are, in fact, thousands of them.	Yes
13362	We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.	Yes
21678	Do you want jobs in the inner city?	No
1538	I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.	No
28694	I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	No
34184	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	No
33940	Why don't you give back the money?	No
22500	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	No
2000	If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	No
9606	Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.	Yes
9482	I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	No
15793	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	No
10440	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	No
22018	But that's what the election's about.	No
25142	I could have gone on forever.	No
34856	The number of food stamp recipients has risen to an unprecedented level, with 2,300,000 individuals receiving more than ever before, despite the removal of 850,000 from the food Stamp Program due to income levels that were too high for their fellow citizens to financially support them.	Yes
21389	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.	No
23426	That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	No
17897	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	No
1963	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
17158	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	Yes
10729	"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""	No
35688	His objective is to provide the average CEO of the Fortune 500 with an extra $700,000 in tax relief.	Yes
6180	That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	No
7582	As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	No
22301	So I think it's worth a shot.	No
25714	But that progress is only the beginning.	No
114	It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.	No
4157	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	No
19338	Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	Yes
8788	So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	No
17988	Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.	Yes
2947	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	No
20439	I commend you for supporting that.	No
20478	It's the right thing for the consumers.	No
663	And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	No
9001	But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	No
19304	The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	No
26958	Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	Yes
34214	Which is a big mistake.	No
2853	We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.	No
26128	So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	Yes
31871	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	Yes
16918	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	Yes
27685	But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	No
6600	He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	Yes
16974	Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	No
35648	Eight nations have departed from it.	Yes
35774	In order to make healthcare more affordable, business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business, Chamber of Commerce, and restaurants have the option to create association plans that cover different jurisdictions, enabling small businesses to participate in national pooling to lower insurance costs.	Yes
17859	Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	Yes
25444	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	Yes
8350	And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	No
18311	They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.	No
12514	There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.	No
33711	The report was so bad.	No
11671	I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	No
34693	Two distinguished men provided me with a- to-go details from those nations.	Yes
7773	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	Yes
22569	I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.	No
15964	But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	Yes
34544	A friend of hers, Soros, made a significant profit.	Yes
25941	They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	Yes
17505	And it's not that simple, either.	No
26210	And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	No
9086	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	No
17745	I'm going to give the President some credit.	No
18301	The president and I have always agreed on that.	No
17471	Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	No
17602	All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	Yes
34264	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	Yes
879	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	No
35072	Our entry was prompted by the ongoing war in Beirut between Israel and PLO terrorists, so forgive me if I'm being too kind.	Yes
6083	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	No
26903	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	No
27593	In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	Yes
7719	Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	No
21306	And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.	No
31896	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	No
30431	And I don't deserve that.	No
17421	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	No
17812	In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	Yes
34462	The fact is that those over $50,000 did not receive a significant tax cut compared to those below 50k.	Yes
13316	We cannot have it in our hearts.	No
17185	I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	No
8947	Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.	Yes
7842	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	Yes
25381	Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	No
26771	We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	No
14144	In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	No
34727	The number of jobs created has increased by ten times since the Republican Party took office, with an overall increase of fewer than 100,000 jobs.	Yes
11418	And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	No
26196	My whole administration is about your future.	No
3096	The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	Yes
18679	The world is more dangerous.	No
13702	It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.	No
10961	As you notice, he starts talking about government.	No
14295	Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	Yes
13082	I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.	No
10042	I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.	No
9759	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	Yes
5854	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	No
35583	The Administration and Mr. Nixon's opposition to reserving medical care for the elderly under Social Security to provide them with some safety is still unclear to me.	Yes
35558	Subsequently, our Embassy was blown up again.	Yes
8622	That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	No
22781	Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	Yes
25293	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	No
15965	And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	No
31926	And that's what I want to talk about.	No
26842	This is a real important election.	No
14134	So the answer is I could do that.	No
35698	Our international alliances and lack of respect has diminished over the past eight years, which has limited our ability to take action against the genocide in Darfur.	Yes
26389	We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	No
8887	if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.	No
35898	Our mayor, who had recently been appointed, refused to proceed with the case.	Yes
22863	Let me talk about North Korea.	No
3666	And that's just a fact.	Yes
35266	Yet, it's been that way for a year.	Yes
1816	I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	No
12529	Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	No
24616	"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	No
15258	That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	No
32496	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	Yes
8744	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	No
35481	The only president in history to have taken a vote is President Bush.	Yes
34596	No other major industrialized society has experienced as much economic growth in the past nine months as we have.	Yes
34724	The President announced a reduction of $60 billion in defense spending, but only $112 billion.	Yes
1252	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	Yes
4149	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	No
17408	We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	Yes
30279	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	No
15177	And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	Yes
11408	One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	No
5558	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	No
17798	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	Yes
24919	You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.	No
34553	They are exempt from paying taxes when they sell their assets to us.	Yes
34585	The slowing down of growth is a side effect of raising taxes.	Yes
5896	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	Yes
13963	You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	Yes
25226	We have an arms race underway instead.	No
3807	And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.	No
4249	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	No
16087	I think I've addressed it.	No
18966	Russia is a country in transition.	No
7771	A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	Yes
12074	She's worked on it longer than I have.	No
34535	I stated in 1992 that he failed to show kindness to President Bush.	Yes
16907	I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.	No
22984	It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	Yes
35038	The majority of our colored children, around 70%, do not graduate from high school.	Yes
23514	But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	No
17670	And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	No
11439	So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	No
9440	Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	Yes
34581	I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent multiple missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to leave these islands.	Yes
11776	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	No
17289	That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	No
17874	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	No
34696	Our construction output has exceeded that of any previous Administration in the last seven years, with a thirty percent increase in house construction.	Yes
10841	And we'll get our economy going again.	No
17445	I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	No
22187	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	No
14479	I say that to both political parties.	No
21823	Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.	No
34825	The issue can be presented on charts, with studies conducted by various groups and a significant deficit persisting after 4, 5, and 6 years.	Yes
14891	The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	Yes
1212	Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	Yes
23440	I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.	Yes
3031	It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	No
1130	And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.	No
10582	They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	No
15867	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	No
23308	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	No
12122	I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.	Yes
23994	That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	No
12663	The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	No
566	And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.	Yes
545	We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.	Yes
26443	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	No
5700	Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	No
23710	That ammo is now being used against our kids.	No
1574	And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	No
4141	He did not say that.	No
1452	We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	No
28462	Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	Yes
20227	I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	No
405	When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?	No
22373	Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	No
12654	I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	No
20293	But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	No
12477	I want to do something about Social Security.	No
7029	He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	No
27386	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	Yes
10387	That's what I've been doing for the last four years.	No
16783	As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.	Yes
21459	And everything in there says what I am for.	No
27984	I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.	No
1287	I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	No
13296	I would disagree with it.	No
32863	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	No
8734	That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	No
31844	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	No
3079	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	Yes
27220	We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	No
26401	Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.	No
13912	We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	No
34800	Donald sought to prosecute a federal judge, who was born in Indiana but claimed that he couldn't be trusted to handle the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	Yes
12981	And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	No
35455	In 1990, President Clinton ran for governor and declared his intention to serve his term as president, but he didn't fulfill his objective.	Yes
13400	So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	No
17787	I told you never would I do such a thing.	No
13018	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	No
8502	Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.	No
35181	The current count of ships is 336.	Yes
34903	I've suggested halting the sale of processing plants to Germany and France for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
27142	No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	No
11135	... just a quick follow-up on this.	No
139	Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	Yes
32911	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	No
15227	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	Yes
35253	In 1975, I was the first president to order affirmative action through various cabinet departments, including the Department of Commerce, to ensure that no American businessman or organization could discriminate against Jews due to an Arab boycott.	Yes
33223	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	Yes
4060	Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	No
34520	I was not informed by Governor Reagan about his plans to halt or decrease terrorism in the future.	Yes
28984	Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	Yes
27972	We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	No
33064	We've got to remain energy-independent.	No
27111	That's exactly what we're doing.	No
19871	It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	Yes
1333	And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	No
7640	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	No
10128	But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	No
26213	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	No
23602	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	No
19090	I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	No
17996	And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.	No
16780	These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.	No
26710	This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	No
19100	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	Yes
11581	I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	No
14094	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	No
6349	And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	No
22565	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	Yes
12250	Well, let me start with Texas.	No
24137	But it is a good program.	No
19481	But let's look at the facts here.	No
35594	I gave myself permission to change Cuba by giving it approximately six months before the act became effective, even though lawsuits can be filed legally.	Yes
20859	Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	No
34578	Despite his claims of being fiscally sound, he chose to waive the budget caps 277 times, which would have resulted in a $4.2 trillion loss for taxpayers.	Yes
27680	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	No
35883	Your rate and tax liability are reduced for the same reason: middle-income taxpayers will no longer be required to pay taxes on interest, dividends, or capital gains.	Yes
636	We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.	Yes
18699	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	Yes
34576	The president granted it to the richest Americans in a tax exemption.	Yes
24695	The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	Yes
3306	I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.	Yes
326	Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	No
15284	The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	No
24812	They fought and won World War II.	No
7943	So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	No
15608	(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	No
18457	Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.	No
24802	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	No
27647	And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	Yes
35700	The military dictatorship in Chile was the recipient of 85 percent of the Food for Peace grants given to South America under Mr. Ford's leadership last year.	Yes
35150	The administration should not be held accountable for the strained relationship with Pakistan, as I don't.	Yes
28263	I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	No
28149	And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	No
11078	I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.	No
22619	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	No
8575	That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.	Yes
12983	Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.	No
1562	I don't believe the present administration has done that.	No
17800	Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	Yes
10857	The bad news is we lost.	No
13759	Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	No
18264	There's a sense of American occupation.	No
18562	And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.	No
11479	But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	No
17008	Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	No
35833	Has incorporated him into our foreign policy and has been channeling aid to Contras through drug traffickers with a track record.	Yes
15723	Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.	No
1852	Donald Trump is a small business.	No
9690	Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	No
23521	I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	No
22582	That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	No
14910	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	Yes
35206	The Iraq war was backed by Donald.	Yes
29144	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	No
15891	I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	No
31996	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	Yes
25863	May I ask you a question?	No
35778	They're open to working with us.	Yes
17830	No, I might as well just go with -- --	No
27230	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	No
17024	It calls for more of the same.	No
7961	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	No
24414	That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	No
34878	Over the past 65 years, we have been working on a hybrid system that is partly private and partly public, and currently, 85% of our citizens have health insurance while only 15% don't.	Yes
20042	I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	No
20728	This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	No
27992	We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	No
26723	One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	No
35479	Five percent is what the Democratic platform and others say.	Yes
21207	Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.	No
20702	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	No
22861	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	No
35520	The work I did has provided healthcare to hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members, while the law requiring more careful dosing has made it safer for children.	Yes
6051	Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.	No
22080	Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	No
18807	It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	No
34285	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	No
15500	And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	No
35079	Regarding the U-2 flights, I would like to emphasize that my support for the President has been ongoing.	Yes
3082	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	No
27165	We want a peaceful planet.	No
757	Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	Yes
35596	The wall was the object of Hillary Clinton's desire.	Yes
35597	He had previously announced that Jim Baker would be the secretary of state, but he has since changed his mind and will now be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
35116	The reality is that the bill proposed this morning was not as high as your proposal, Mr. Nixon.	Yes
35804	The majority of the 10 and a half million new jobs created are in higher-wage sectors, leading to an increase in manufacturing and sales across the globe.	Yes
25709	I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	No
35006	The first two years of your presidency were spent without any tax breaks, Mr. President.	Yes
12531	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	No
35466	I witnessed an act that is against the law, where individuals are being urged to engage in physical altercations and violence.	Yes
21700	We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	No
33423	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	No
17466	So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	No
25800	First of all, let me say what we have done.	No
512	That's the way you help people.	No
5939	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	No
34832	Mr. Bush's administration has created more private sector jobs than the rest of the country, with manufacturing employment rates far exceeding that of other industries in recent years, as stated by his labor secretary.	Yes
11622	I wouldn't have supported either.	No
27608	But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	No
19375	You know, mine doesn't work that way.	No
23081	Now, he talks about Medicare.	No
15018	This has been a very successful effort.	No
19797	When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	No
30062	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	No
32761	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	No
20093	I wasn't just getting more power and more power.	No
23229	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	No
35050	The unemployment rate for minority youth is currently at 30-40 percent.	Yes
6054	So here's what my plan does.	No
35433	Our disagreement with China was based on their copying of our CDs, which resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs in California and other regions.	Yes
23037	There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	No
4169	We will take a look.	No
9523	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	No
31862	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	Yes
30461	I'm going to be able to do it.	No
12828	Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	No
24102	I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	No
31888	I'm not proud of it.	No
14242	You want to have a new program in this country.	No
1124	I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	No
24957	And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?	No
28194	There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.	No
17895	Are we better of with this arms race?	No
35760	The United States of America currently pays 35 percent of the world's second-highest business taxes.	Yes
3825	We took our eye off the ball.	No
5523	Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	No
19003	I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.	No
35615	It has resulted in the most significant failure of any small business in half a century.	Yes
9175	I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	No
19705	Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	No
34495	Gerald Ford left a five-year long plan for military buildup to restore our defenses, but President Carter's administration cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program and delayed the B-l missile production line.	Yes
33318	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	No
24140	Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.	No
12906	Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	Yes
29510	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	No
523	If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	No
35843	I opposed the idea of funding a mission that had no timetable and was unrestricted, offering monetary compensation to George Bush.	Yes
32804	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	Yes
33386	I voted for border security, and there are...	Yes
11739	I certainly agree with that.	No
25328	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	Yes
11495	He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.	No
22466	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	No
2876	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	No
21792	If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	No
33628	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	No
12710	We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	No
3558	Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	No
25075	There's a big difference between the two of us.	No
25924	When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.	Yes
27366	It's not driven by politics.	Yes
7907	We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.	No
13834	Our government is that point now.	No
14929	But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	Yes
10674	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	No
22747	Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	No
18614	That's why it's essential we hold the line.	No
25146	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	No
18973	It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	No
19058	By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.	No
24604	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	Yes
13448	Particularly some of the smaller producers.	No
19237	And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	No
11820	That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	No
23306	As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	Yes
25165	On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.	No
19162	We'll have specific differences later.	No
19484	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	Yes
10363	The president said he would.	No
19561	He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	Yes
1149	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	No
11725	That's what it's meant to do.	No
13175	And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	Yes
16992	It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	No
34736	Four out of the five George Bush budgets were chosen by Senator McCain in his vote.	Yes
25874	We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.	No
1368	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	Yes
6084	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	No
2812	I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.	No
17398	So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	No
35711	Those requests for pork-barrel projects were suspended by Senator Obama after he became a presidential candidate in the United States.	Yes
27440	So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	Yes
17097	In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	Yes
20242	And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	No
34593	The initial reduction in defense spending was excessive.	Yes
34970	The Freedom Support Act, which was led by me, worked in partnership with Democratic ambassador Bob Strauss and Jim Baker to ensure Russia became fully democratic, despite the Soviet Union's demise.	Yes
6912	You want to buy into it, you can.	No
30325	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	No
27874	...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...	No
33256	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	No
35799	Fortunately, the salaries of teachers have increased by fifty percent in the last eight years, while other salaries have only seen a 30% rise.	Yes
26008	And we will do that.	No
19594	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	No
10129	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	No
8953	And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.	Yes
17698	They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.	No
12737	If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.	No
17483	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	No
6966	We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	No
25199	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	No
13409	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	No
35326	The private sector has added 5 million jobs in the past 30 months.	Yes
6255	Of course, we have to come together.	No
9088	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	No
34883	The growth rate is slower this year compared to last year, and even more so than the previous year.	Yes
20109	I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.	Yes
16303	Why have there been these safety violations?	No
29482	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	Yes
18725	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	No
24579	If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	No
19723	It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	No
15246	And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	No
12284	We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	No
27175	Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	Yes
22146	You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	No
15211	We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	Yes
20768	Let me tell you what the facts are.	No
21934	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	No
28760	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	No
9935	Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	Yes
25369	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	No
10067	But she works for me.	No
34679	Taxes were lowered for the 15 million working Americans.	Yes
27148	That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	No
359	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	Yes
2135	My grandfather died a while back.	No
9564	That's math that doesn't add up.	No
16894	There's some question about their morality.	No
25141	Well, the red light went on.	No
2093	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	Yes
27343	States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.	Yes
22188	And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	Yes
12882	And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	No
8360	Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	No
9562	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	Yes
19186	Well, I guess some may be better off.	No
35107	The world was shielded by us on an annual basis of $300 billion.	Yes
10220	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	Yes
12856	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	No
22783	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	No
11053	We are a force of good in the world.	No
35462	Under Obamacare, you've boosted them by $1 trillion.	Yes
17854	If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.	No
12111	Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	Yes
22140	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	Yes
23886	Well, they've got a point.	No
679	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	No
7489	And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	No
9891	People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.	No
2743	There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.	No
34321	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	No
11217	I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	No
31898	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	No
34563	He has been the most successful president in terms of deployment of troops throughout history.	Yes
24193	Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.	No
34751	Bringing back manufacturing to our shores will help us create jobs here, as we have done with the auto industry, rather than compensating companies that send jobs overseas.	Yes
28140	I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.	No
15753	And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.	No
32786	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	No
8507	The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	Yes
16858	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	Yes
17093	Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	Yes
19964	Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?	No
35663	Social Security was declared a failure by them three days after the 1982 election.	Yes
2062	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	No
17885	The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	No
35001	After taking a single rejection from the Soviet Union, we resumed negotiations on their terms due to Mr. Carter's actions of cancelling the B-I bomber, postponing the MX, delaying the Trident submarine, delaying its cruise missile, shutting down all Missile Man production lines, and other related activities.	Yes
20320	And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	No
14862	And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.	No
12709	The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	No
17429	There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	No
3976	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	Yes
13798	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	Yes
26402	The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	Yes
93	It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	Yes
19897	But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	Yes
2747	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	No
17124	And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	No
14306	We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	No
12046	The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	No
27255	The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	No
34948	We've done that, made some changes, and we're presenting it to Congress right now as a $4 trillion proposal...	Yes
895	But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.	No
24150	And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	No
24073	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	Yes
26943	That's not the right course for us.	No
26807	But I would just say this.	No
1081	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	Yes
33527	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	No
19501	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	No
16825	A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	Yes
23716	And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	No
26930	Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	Yes
17478	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	Yes
27114	I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.	No
2219	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	No
15976	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	Yes
24667	I will have a unique mandate.	No
11903	Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	No
24452	I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	Yes
26411	And my word is good.	No
2347	So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	Yes
24507	So we're still in the fight.	No
30126	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	No
17980	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	No
20671	The warning signs are real.	No
35567	My signature bill on the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill would enable 25 million people to have health insurance when they change jobs or fall ill.	Yes
34705	Senator McCain has made it clear that my proposal involves cutting more than what I'm currently spending, resulting in a net spending cut.	Yes
19125	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	No
21340	It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.	Yes
8474	In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.	No
33756	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	No
30011	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	Yes
124	I will say this -	No
6964	And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	No
35471	The rescue package has the authority of the secretary, but it has not been executed yet.	Yes
25110	But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	Yes
28797	Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	No
12414	That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	Yes
35612	Despite the fact that certain issues are not favorable to us in terms of democracy, what is an alternative solution?	Yes
7744	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	No
34985	You'll still get a match if you earn more than $60,000 and up to 100, but not as generously.	Yes
3295	Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.	No
35483	Last week, your campaign manager confirmed the accuracy of the statement.	Yes
19775	He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.	No
1605	We've been drifting too long.	No
28459	I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	No
22442	Congress -- they're all good people.	No
22026	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	No
16763	Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	No
7532	Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	No
23643	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	No
29535	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	No
34628	He declared that trickle-down economics was voodoo economica, and he has since become the most prominent practitioner of it.	Yes
15245	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	Yes
26349	That was a tax credit for the employer.	No
14275	Sometimes he has to act.	No
19722	I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	No
22886	It works particularly when we pay our troops well.	No
29795	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	No
20775	Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	Yes
32340	How do you do that?	No
28553	But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	No
29327	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	No
13952	When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.	No
12650	Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	No
29172	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	No
18661	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	No
20050	See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	No
16687	We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.	Yes
33030	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	Yes
20071	I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	No
13712	Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.	Yes
12325	I think that we do.	No
29246	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	Yes
13672	I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	No
2612	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	Yes
29955	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	Yes
1830	And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	Yes
25600	Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	Yes
3126	As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	Yes
25028	I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	No
35025	Banks are hesitant to provide loans and mortgages.	Yes
33593	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	No
21703	I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.	No
3688	They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	Yes
8746	We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.	No
22644	He's trying to attack me.	No
21816	I think you have to take on medical fraud.	No
19147	These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	No
32085	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	Yes
1817	But that -- that is not the case.	No
20425	The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	No
23221	That's the way we leave it.	No
35089	Governor Romney is now aiming to extend the tax breaks.	Yes
27271	But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	Yes
12839	And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	No
20201	I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.	No
19387	So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	Yes
19474	You talk about the Brady Bill.	No
34392	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	No
3236	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	No
26810	There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	No
20069	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	No
28040	He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	No
29219	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	No
21715	I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.	No
29548	Let her release the e-mails.	No
245	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	No
18962	And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	No
3325	Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	No
34701	As a 2008 hopeful, I was under the impression that taking bin Laden's bullet would be an option, but you disagreed and suggested that we should not travel to capture him.	Yes
34524	He reduced defense spending by $60 billion and eliminated numerous job opportunities.	Yes
34151	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	Yes
11763	I just want to make sure the return is good.	No
35388	Nevertheless, the last 3 percent of businesses employ half or all of the individuals who work in small businesses.	Yes
718	I'm not reconsidering my position.	No
34243	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	No
18076	I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	No
5838	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	No
375	Mr. Bush talked about values.	No
3294	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	Yes
6984	He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.	Yes
35690	The United States is significantly ahead of the world in terms of absolute differences, as opposed to twenty years ago.	Yes
34508	The amount of arms shipped overseas during the Republican Party's time in power has risen from $1 billion to 10 to 12 billion, with countries now using these weapons to engage in warfare.	Yes
19415	Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	Yes
35248	His representative had been instructed by him to surrender all sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone to the locals after a specific period.	Yes
33944	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	No
21741	Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.	No
10181	But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	No
4017	"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	No
24074	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	Yes
14896	The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	Yes
16833	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	No
34651	I'm confused, Jim. Why do we get our tax cuts first year to the wealthiest 1% and then have to wait four or five years for seniors to receive their final penny?	Yes
3968	It's ruled by a handful of tribes.	No
24995	And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	Yes
10497	I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	No
21171	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	No
18717	But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	No
25486	I don't trust the Russians.	No
28179	I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	No
7946	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	No
20064	I have relatives on Medicare.	No
18513	But I think it's worth it, Jim.	No
12820	But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	No
26989	I have clear eyes on this.	No
2247	Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	No
8397	And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	No
30040	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	No
34509	It is my view that it is irresponsible to face a budget deficit of $60 billion, which could be as high as $63 billion in the current fiscal year.	Yes
22141	Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.	Yes
12470	I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.	No
21605	And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.	No
8962	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	Yes
1412	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	Yes
19211	How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	No
24293	We've got to help them.	No
34876	Our focus is on mobilizing moderate forces within Syria, while also providing humanitarian assistance and supporting the opposition in organizing.	Yes
17769	And that's the way it should be.	No
34547	The federal deficit and health care costs were not solely caused by this, but also by the concerns of millions of families about financial ruin if they became sick.	Yes
35750	In the past few days, an extension of the loophole has been expanded and given away $43 billion in prizes, including favors to the oil and gas industry and those who import ceiling fans from China.	Yes
24330	There's no question about that.	No
27727	That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	Yes
32511	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	No
1688	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	No
23450	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	No
15502	And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	No
2146	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	No
2576	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	No
34763	In reality, I brought together Republicans and Democrats to achieve the passage of a patient's bill of rights in Texas.	Yes
3730	We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.	Yes
35749	He asserts that the increase in medical liability costs is just 1 percent, as stated in the second point.	Yes
6950	Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	No
7992	And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.	No
11489	Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	No
26773	And we're all proud of it.	No
14301	But look who's around with him there.	No
31920	We're going to make America safe again.	No
28498	You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	Yes
1575	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	No
25885	But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.	No
16670	We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	No
33967	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	Yes
1823	There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	Yes
17678	Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	No
11077	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	No
34488	Despite the guaranteed loans, we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as intermediaries for the student loan program during my presidency to make college education more affordable.	Yes
6277	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	No
12544	And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	No
35336	Mr. Nixon pointed out that the Soviet production accounts for just forty-four percent of ours.	Yes
12739	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	Yes
34318	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	Yes
25900	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	No
28363	This is a big spender.	No
14106	On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.	Yes
8261	And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	Yes
1461	One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	No
1514	We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	Yes
29440	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	Yes
7475	And some would say maybe me more so than others.	No
21788	If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	No
3773	We have to obviously cut spending.	No
13612	Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.	Yes
12098	Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	No
29266	We invested in a solar company, our country.	Yes
35503	The unemployment rate in this country is higher than that of Great Britain and West Germany.	Yes
1920	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	Yes
5702	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	Yes
26184	You're almost not old enough to remember this.	No
22812	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	No
35629	The Fed's political motive is evident when they maintain interest rates at this level.	Yes
34843	In September 2003, he advocated for the amnesty granted to illegal aliens.	Yes
9648	Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.	No
26605	I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	No
25947	Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	No
24468	It can be a single-parent family.	No
35063	Senator Dole's February statement was a clear indication that the American economy was in its most favorable state in three decades.	Yes
18349	Well, there are summits being held.	No
34906	Certain army bases are required by the act to provide shelter for people during difficult times.	Yes
25298	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	No
298	They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	No
12562	And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	No
19720	Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.	No
33095	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	No
28333	There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	No
19873	And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	Yes
3758	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	No
10658	I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	No
23875	Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	No
20916	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	Yes
18732	And I think this will work.	No
34665	The primary contributor to humanitarian aid for Somalia is America.	Yes
19124	Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	No
15512	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	No
15588	No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.	No
15734	I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	No
10145	But let me mention another thing.	No
32377	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	No
11280	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	No
23123	I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	No
25184	Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	No
34141	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	No
35593	She is now considering signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
31978	I'm not proud of it.	No
19156	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	Yes
21973	When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	No
33630	But they have to pay up.	No
17173	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	No
2321	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	Yes
14494	It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.	No
24284	Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	No
22131	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	No
8246	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	No
4350	"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""	Yes
20822	A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	No
2280	I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	No
35243	The intelligence-gathering and law-enforcement arms of the FBI were not permitted to exchange intelligence due to the old law.	Yes
6266	Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	No
11251	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	No
12202	That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	Yes
32153	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	No
27759	It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
32736	And I'm pretty good at it.	No
19605	We don't know what's going to happen.	No
11825	But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	No
3914	But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	No
35132	I've been working with the leaders mentioned by the president for 20 years, which is a long time in my career.	Yes
24931	And he drew up this manual.	No
18798	I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.	No
11766	I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	No
7828	Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	No
21925	Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	No
26032	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	Yes
32489	We are going to be thriving again.	No
23351	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	No
28045	Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.	Yes
10935	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	No
1873	But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.	Yes
1501	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	Yes
19590	When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.	No
34176	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	No
5548	Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.	No
35631	I mentioned earlier that we reached an agreement to limit the number of uh - urh missile launchers to twenty-four times.	Yes
32834	Take a look at upstate New York.	No
10159	But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	No
28092	And I believe I can.	No
24465	I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	No
14218	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	Yes
19104	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	Yes
23272	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	No
34697	She has a complete collection of donors, including all or most of them.	Yes
11000	Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	Yes
19185	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	No
24978	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	No
2026	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	No
32275	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	No
11083	This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	No
18837	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	No
35579	The president publicly reversed it while the president of South Korea was present.	Yes
5725	Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.	No
13930	Let's think it through here.	No
16546	I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	No
1059	But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	No
32654	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	No
19137	That, to me, is the key.	No
17703	I'm opposed to that, too.	No
12259	The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	Yes
20751	We're talking about a massive government, folks.	No
6020	Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	Yes
10724	"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	No
13117	It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	No
12921	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.	No
15202	And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	No
20488	I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.	No
34826	The reason why our taxes are so high is largely due to the fact that they are almost the highest in the world.	Yes
26486	That's just one tiny example.	No
9044	We spoke a multitude of tongues.	No
5730	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	Yes
35902	The 98 percent have been held captive by Governor Romney's supporters in Congress, who are advocating for tax cuts to benefit the top 2 percent.	Yes
19277	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	No
937	But there are two main focal points of this election.	No
19906	We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	No
34746	Based on your estimates, deferring foreign income could result in savings of approximately $500 million.	Yes
32089	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	No
20102	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	Yes
24858	We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.	No
21	And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	No
28742	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	No
35729	The level of protection offered is much higher today than it was during my tenure as governor of Texas.	Yes
6319	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	Yes
32585	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
25813	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	No
24070	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	No
35686	I thought his record might lead us back to the things we knew from the old government, but he made it clear that deficits were not to be disregarded and claimed that they were beneficial for the economy by doubling the deficit and reducing unemployment.	Yes
10542	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	Yes
12637	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	No
1086	But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	Yes
422	There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	No
23139	There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	No
10987	It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.	No
16711	Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	Yes
17448	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	No
20010	Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	No
5535	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	No
14759	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	Yes
25803	Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	Yes
34480	America's purpose is not what we want to achieve by eradicating the 400,000 desperate, hopeless, and defenseless Americans on disability grounds, who are confused and unable to defend themselves, as we did for 4 years.	Yes
8215	And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	No
19284	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	No
19191	For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	Yes
35394	We are spending $10 billion every month in Iraq while the Iraqis have a surplus of $79 billion.	Yes
25387	And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	No
3108	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	Yes
9231	That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	No
34835	Five percent of the world's population resides in this country, you know.	Yes
21824	They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	Yes
9725	And the plans that I talked about will create even more.	No
4133	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	Yes
8536	And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	No
25192	You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.	No
15963	We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.	No
34541	A tax bill that I signed on Monday contained an amendment to prevent American companies from taking a tax deduction for aiding the Arab boycott.	Yes
25204	Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	No
33148	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	No
35670	The lack of knowledge about submarine missile recallability, the fact that 70% of our strategic forces are conventional, and the failure of arms control efforts due to the presence of most Soviet missiles on land three years into his administration make it a challenge for any President to command these actions.	Yes
13713	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	Yes
11871	She said, reading is the new civil right.	No
25119	Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	No
15417	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	No
27267	New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	Yes
7820	On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.	Yes
8730	All of these things can be done.	No
2400	And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	Yes
14951	As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	Yes
34609	Despite his proposal to increase spending by $2.2 trillion, the tax on the wealthy, which is also a tax burden on small business owners in America, has raised approximately $600 million according to our calculations.	Yes
17857	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	Yes
12742	Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	No
35126	It's a poor decision, according to Mr. Perot.	Yes
16068	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	No
22889	We don't need mass armies anymore.	No
17767	Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?	No
11838	And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	Yes
11942	I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	No
19372	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	Yes
13594	Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	No
21016	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	Yes
22755	But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.	No
29053	I want to have the military keeping the peace.	No
1586	We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	Yes
5970	"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	Yes
2593	The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.	Yes
24021	I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	No
12547	That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	No
15022	Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.	Yes
34538	Our income has grown at a faster pace than the national average in the past 5 years.	Yes
23860	I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	No
822	He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	Yes
13406	And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	No
29	Everybody ought to be in this thing.	No
35571	The Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement budget was reduced by a third.	Yes
22117	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	No
18715	I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	No
18801	We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	Yes
19781	That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	No
1034	I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	No
14705	I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	No
1038	At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.	Yes
15463	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	Yes
35428	When Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies, the president didn't stand up for Boeing.	Yes
12220	And they have not got it done.	Yes
16089	And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.	No
86	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	No
21411	I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.	No
743	As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	Yes
20869	We had a great time.	No
13800	I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	No
11809	I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.	No
14676	And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	Yes
16636	And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	No
8337	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	No
1071	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	No
22995	I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	No
27892	They would have gone through a...	No
32690	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	Yes
8075	They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	No
12768	I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	No
31928	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	No
27468	I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	No
13281	Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	Yes
28396	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	No
25539	"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	No
3484	So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	No
15372	But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	No
25749	They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.	Yes
25923	A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	No
28543	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	No
2580	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	No
10571	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	No
14258	That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	No
19089	And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.	No
16479	In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	Yes
16712	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	Yes
8725	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	Yes
27488	And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	No
25877	We used to have 18.	Yes
19535	You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.	Yes
35895	There are 168 federal programs that have the authority to grant quotas.	Yes
28000	I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.	No
34910	I am the only governor who has been elected for four consecutive years.	Yes
32685	You don't even know who the rebels are.	No
23090	He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.	Yes
34594	A bipartisan commission was responsible for examining the findings of two distinguished economists, which suggested that we could obtain approximately 40, 45, or 50 billion dollars.	Yes
35653	We increased the number of employees to provide better mental health care to our people.	Yes
8727	I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	No
6844	We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	No
18400	It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	No
17915	The President's record is quite different.	No
26351	This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	No
10609	And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.	Yes
14739	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	No
25895	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	No
22622	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	No
35244	Our Race to the Top program has prompted reforms in 46 states across the country, which have raised standards and improved teacher training.	Yes
588	And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	No
16352	And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	No
8419	I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	No
25572	A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	No
35176	He has the liberty to justify any explanation, but the reality is that we're reducing the uninsured portion of our populace.	Yes
8077	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	No
35884	It is not only that an innocent person has been executed, but that the actual perpetrator of the crime has not been brought to trial.	Yes
15706	It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.	No
18294	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	No
26161	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	No
26244	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	No
7284	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	Yes
25346	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
35915	Bill Burns, a senior ambassador of President Bush, was recently dispatched to participate in negotiations with the European Union regarding nuclear weapons.	Yes
28487	Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	No
23059	Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	No
7768	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	Yes
12732	We will select the best man we can get.	No
35766	Despite having 35 million uninsured individuals and no preventive and primary care programs, our country is spending 30% more on health care than any other country in the world.	Yes
27560	And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	No
14126	You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	No
27646	We then started to build up Afghan forces.	No
24920	That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	No
287	I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.	No
293	And I don't agree with them.	No
3232	Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	Yes
26971	You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	Yes
14601	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	Yes
8492	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	No
35917	Having vetoed four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon, it's clear to me that this isn't the case.	Yes
30446	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	No
8029	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	No
35517	The federal government increases approximately 6% of the funds.	Yes
6520	Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	No
35793	The implementation of a BTU tax resulted in impose taxes of $35 million and $265 billion, respectively.	Yes
2913	These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	No
34355	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	No
16738	And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.	No
7810	This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	No
35664	Senator Dole's criticism of special interest money was not my own, as we did not attempt to save children who were exposed to tobacco and then go to the growers to defend the tobacco industry against the government.	Yes
1968	When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	Yes
31864	We had an $800 billion deficit.	Yes
27495	But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	No
9904	And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.	No
8349	I do not say that I have made the decisions.	No
14859	In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	No
25821	So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	No
23873	I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.	No
25234	But it takes more than that.	No
35723	They lacked the necessary tanks and weapons.	Yes
12848	I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	No
32184	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
19178	He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	Yes
6595	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
10851	Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	No
15026	It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.	No
35796	When you have seven and a half million unemployed, inflation that is three times the level of the previous Democratic administration, and financial deficits that are too high for families to afford college or housing, there is an instinctive reaction to being turned off.	Yes
2596	It's time for a new path.	No
13627	So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	No
27113	I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.	No
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	Yes
12888	First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	No
24188	Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.	No
22558	I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	No
19574	It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	No
22143	Coming out of World War II it made sense.	No
14474	And they buried it till right after the election.	Yes
97	I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	Yes
35792	Prior to the Kansas City convention, he reinstated the defense budget by an additional one point eight billion dollars.	Yes
16832	Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	No
30229	No, they were taunting us.	No
10257	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	No
19520	We just had the election there.	No
22283	Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	No
23970	In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	No
29790	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	No
17617	[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	Yes
13309	Also as far as religion is concerned.	No
24805	That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	No
32344	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	No
35827	It's a criminal act that many people are aware of.	Yes
12201	And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	Yes
35623	At the moment, you can see it happening in the economy.	Yes
16588	When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	Yes
1893	Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.	No
2972	We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	Yes
16664	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	Yes
3574	Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	No
16398	There is much to be done.	No
27509	And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	Yes
15218	I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	No
18560	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	Yes
12174	I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	No
34207	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	No
18591	You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.	No
17370	I've said it's going to take some work.	No
26202	Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.	No
35087	His economic program was not implemented until more than 1300 days into his presidency, and his health care initiative has not been fully presented to Congress yet.	Yes
9970	I don't check it that often.	No
21327	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	No
27398	First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.	No
13228	I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.	No
25032	And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.	Yes
11775	The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	No
18757	And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	Yes
34467	The Secretary of Defense, who is the president's secretary, referred to it as devastating, and I haven't used that term.	Yes
24180	And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	No
15530	But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	No
5807	Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	No
17403	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	No
2573	Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	No
11579	If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	No
29783	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	No
18302	And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.	Yes
15516	He had two terms in the Congress.	No
21314	There will be a job-sucking sound going south.	No
5517	But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.	No
23264	I have a tax cut.	No
17212	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	Yes
11087	Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
11323	My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	No
23394	You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	No
19293	It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.	Yes
8013	Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.	Yes
15745	But there are limits to what we can spend.	No
6379	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	No
13376	But Social Security is a tax.	No
10768	Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	Yes
8697	And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	Yes
26622	Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	Yes
17241	And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	No
25807	In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	No
2320	So what did we do?	No
12110	They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.	No
20083	We just see the world in different ways.	No
19836	There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	Yes
16282	Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	No
34277	This would not be done just on the first day.	No
8185	this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	Yes
32810	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	No
26960	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	Yes
18261	And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	Yes
15378	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	No
35134	The total tax amount is greater than the expenses for food, clothing, and shelter under this regime.	Yes
3328	And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
12394	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	No
14495	The people need to take their government back.	No
513	Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	No
34619	They are not required to pay an extra $6,000.	Yes
29012	One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	No
25517	And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	No
5634	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	No
16944	I would have uh - done it opposite.	No
2130	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	No
11118	Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.	No
12916	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	No
25970	Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	Yes
28583	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	Yes
10829	There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	No
116	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	Yes
30256	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	No
12452	And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	No
15692	But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.	No
24194	And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	No
968	Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.	No
26536	17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
18187	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	No
24602	We have increased funding for AIDS.	Yes
8905	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	No
24640	The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	No
2489	Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.	Yes
29559	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	No
30331	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	No
1877	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	No
13385	Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	No
27691	We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	Yes
34953	It has been 30 or 26 years since you last did it, and there is no chance of...	Yes
8593	The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	Yes
12612	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	No
13654	I disagree with both of them.	No
288	I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	No
29374	I'm very proud of it.	No
28747	Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	No
34703	A report released by two former defense secretaries last week, including Mr. Carlucci, has suggested that a total of 100,000 troops or slightly less would be adequate.	Yes
32289	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	No
28169	I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.	No
9666	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	No
6942	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	No
21592	That happened when I was president.	Yes
13927	We cannot lose those jobs.	No
24101	Your question was on fairness.	No
23373	Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.	No
738	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	No
13476	Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	No
9196	We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	No
35418	Our expenditure on education is not meeting our objectives, and we're spending more money per child.	Yes
24403	Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	No
16849	I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	No
540	The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	Yes
20996	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	Yes
24062	He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.	Yes
35478	During the Reagan-Bush administration, there were six payroll taxes increases, leading to a decrease in income for middle-class individuals with $52,000 or lower.	Yes
35018	I, in my role as Vice President, traveled to the Philippines, where I campaigned for human rights, demanded the release of Aquino, and accomplished progress that had been stalled on Subic and Clark airfield bases.	Yes
9034	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	No
13719	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	No
5656	I know how to eliminate programs.	No
11014	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	No
7309	And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	Yes
3327	And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	Yes
19378	But let me respond to what you said.	No
14983	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	No
25639	"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	No
13736	I think it's been pretty impressive.	No
16252	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	No
22161	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	No
28738	But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.	No
6614	Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	No
34710	In the eight years before I became President, this country experienced a decline in its own military strength.	Yes
20776	Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.	No
18675	Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.	Yes
9918	Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.	No
3713	We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	No
34517	NATO and other allies are ready, willing, and capable of bearing a significant burden in the Balkans.	Yes
11407	He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	No
28318	They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	Yes
35818	The prevalent mindset that causes harm to individuals is disregarded when it is revealed that our nation has a 6 percent unemployment rate, 7 percent inflation, and 6 per cent inflation.	Yes
35062	They have financed Hezbollah, Hamas, and increased their centrifuge capacity to build a nuclear weapon.	Yes
16011	And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	No
1070	We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	No
20040	And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	No
28196	They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	No
13197	And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	No
35617	At least 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been prohibited from accessing handguns under the Brady Bill.	Yes
32667	And you know what happens?	No
618	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	No
20612	But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	No
14675	So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	No
4061	Let's just make that very clear.	No
24710	I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	No
8723	But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	No
2327	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	No
1126	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	No
2924	He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	Yes
14625	And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	Yes
1693	That's not what I'm going to do.	No
22263	Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	No
35765	As previously noted, we have achieved a new record-breaking number of jobs by adding approximately nine million in the same timeframe.	Yes
8791	But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.	No
35499	He didn't adopt that perspective on Tibet.	Yes
29724	We have to bring back law and order.	No
35740	America's ability to lead in auto production is due to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and a significant effort to increase trade and economic presence globally.	Yes
17491	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	No
159	And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	Yes
25462	And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	Yes
17627	And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	Yes
12014	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	Yes
9609	We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	Yes
19962	The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	No
28059	It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	No
34476	The revolution's promise included democracy, human rights, free labor unions, and free press.	Yes
913	Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.	Yes
586	But now we have a chance.	No
24961	I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	No
11952	I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	No
22103	I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	No
4343	It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.	No
27441	They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	No
15101	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	No
19422	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	No
35855	He employed undocumented workers to construct the Trump Tower.	Yes
34756	The cost of insurance for him is lower than that of the nearby Mom and Pop's store.	Yes
21010	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	No
34743	We have achieved the creation of five million jobs, a significant improvement from the previous loss of 800 jobs per month.	Yes
642	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	No
8129	I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	Yes
21731	I didn't get to make a comment on this.	No
8043	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	No
17672	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	No
13892	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	Yes
32710	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	No
34988	Roughly half of the population in this nation has access to retirement savings.	Yes
2202	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	Yes
6401	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	No
35083	They lack the same level of offensive capabilities to target the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	Yes
24363	Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.	No
19857	But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	No
19259	I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.	Yes
9560	I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.	No
4280	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	No
34519	Billions of dollars in lost revenue are likely to be regained by insurance companies due to the repeal, even though they are not improving the health of seniors.	Yes
3895	First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.	No
33669	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	Yes
34607	Moreover, that was executed following the issuance of a subpoena.	Yes
27786	But this can't keep on going.	No
1369	I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	No
7150	Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	No
29891	She failed to get the birth certificate.	Yes
27526	This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	No
35694	The troops were killed when they went back to the President, who asked for their withdrawal from the United States.	Yes
21684	And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	No
914	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	No
13483	I think we have been right in carrying it.	No
8145	I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.	No
24900	I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.	No
3987	Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	No
20202	I have questioned his proposals.	No
35465	The fact that Russia is now urging for a change in foreign policy due to the Cold War's conclusion has made Governor Romney emphatic about the threat posed by Al Qaida.	Yes
1793	When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	Yes
15581	No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	No
19540	I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.	No
6875	I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	No
20877	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	No
16328	Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	No
7422	I think we have to come together and work to change it.	No
4120	President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	Yes
20031	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	No
29742	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	Yes
6056	If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	Yes
17918	We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.	No
17348	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	No
3885	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	No
7664	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	No
33730	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	Yes
10638	I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	Yes
35046	The private sector in my state is experiencing a surge in employment.	Yes
15283	As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.	Yes
14727	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	No
16515	Well, as a matter of fact there is.	No
17886	Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	No
15832	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	No
28907	You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	No
35404	The economy of this Administration and country had the lowest rate of economic growth in 1959, which included employment, compared to any other major industrialized nation.	Yes
28981	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	No
10888	We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.	Yes
35552	The communications industry is now our area of focus.	Yes
5989	And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	No
1914	My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.	No
4132	And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	No
28924	Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.	Yes
26465	Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	No
2532	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	No
1171	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	No
2889	Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	No
13968	I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	No
26504	I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	No
16000	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	Yes
35147	Our nation's military might may be compromised if adversaries unexpectedly attack us, as Senator Kennedy acknowledged.	Yes
1423	Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	Yes
28364	And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.	No
26674	"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	No
12308	So long as people have input.	No
20558	I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	No
969	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	No
12548	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	Yes
28614	We need to open up markets.	No
4384	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	No
19657	The President held it up.	Yes
21041	It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	Yes
12798	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	No
35581	It is true that we are spending $200 billion annually on human needs, which accounts for almost half of the federal government's total expenditure, according to Mr. Kraft.	Yes
11679	But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	No
23525	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	No
25118	Our position happened to be at the airport.	No
11647	But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	No
19895	If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	No
19418	I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	No
35439	We have witnessed him insulting women.	Yes
22460	And we have got to put our nation back to work.	No
25197	"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	No
6849	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	No
3343	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	Yes
12167	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	Yes
28270	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	No
33458	People are going to come in from Syria.	No
35748	People's actions lead to an estimated four hundred billion.	Yes
226	Let me say this about AIDS.	No
12986	And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	No
35039	The last eight years have been characterized by me having the privilege of abstaining from the old economic plan and replacing it with a new one that has led to significant progress, 22 million jobs, and the most successful outcome in history.	Yes
32443	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
22193	We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	No
12573	First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
16543	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	Yes
6193	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	No
305	I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.	No
25566	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	No
2364	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	No
29851	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	No
32276	But the name is there.	No
3048	We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	No
16770	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	Yes
9548	And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.	Yes
3753	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
35474	The President of the United States has stated that they are not part of this treaty.	Yes
560	Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.	No
24462	So I do think we need to strengthen family.	No
34507	If the wealthy pay 62% of their taxes today, my plan is for them to do so.	Yes
17131	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	No
13000	We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	No
15151	Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	Yes
24225	And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.	No
20308	Then you go to your own pharmacy.	No
15890	Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	No
35364	The second highest tax rate for businesses in the United States is present.	Yes
11246	We tend to be reactive.	No
34546	The president did not honor his pledge to finance No Child Left Behind.	Yes
2217	They'll have at least two plans.	Yes
243	And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	No
19570	You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	Yes
17199	And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.	Yes
24673	And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	No
26918	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	No
2562	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	No
14848	This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	No
19493	I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	No
34861	Human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, and elections are among the principles.	Yes
12870	They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	No
35680	17 new taxes, price controls, and 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
9703	President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	Yes
398	Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.	No
26613	In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.	Yes
23135	He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.	No
12530	I think there're several reasons.	No
35215	The decline in home values among retired individuals is causing people to become incapable of paying their mortgage payments.	Yes
1812	So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	No
23167	What means something is: Do you have a plan?	No
12673	And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.	No
20035	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	No
30129	And they're going to do that.	No
28510	It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.	No
14913	Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	Yes
21798	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	No
7508	And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	No
35771	A few weeks ago, I was in my office and one of the top-ranking former Naval operations chiefs informed me about the shortage of 25,000 Chief Petty Officers.	Yes
365	And I think the housing community is ready.	No
35346	The suggestion made by Mr. Nixon is that the United States should declare war on these two islands if they are attacked.	Yes
16923	That, I think, is a good balance.	No
21593	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	No
16721	There ought to be a standardized design.	No
23592	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	No
15369	Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	Yes
15831	No, let me tell you something about that.	No
976	And the best America is not behind us.	No
3894	Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.	No
35788	Despite the United Nations' search for nuclear capability, there has been no evidence of US technology being involved.	Yes
24614	So I think the appeal is yes, we care.	No
24585	I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	No
27784	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	No
78	But we also have to take demand seriously.	No
25125	There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	No
14837	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	No
33655	... that's offshore back into the country.	No
21855	If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	No
1892	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
22202	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	No
21610	We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	No
20225	We know how to set agendas.	No
121	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	No
12446	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	No
34471	In Nicaragua, we have a man who is contracted by the CIA to provide advice on military tactics for the contras.	Yes
34185	Chris, we don't gain anything.	No
14044	And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.	No
15173	But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	No
26012	I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	No
2459	But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	No
33162	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	No
20424	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	No
20757	He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	Yes
2096	But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	No
11011	That's how in banking it works.	No
6732	It's important that we do that.	No
35071	He ends this term with no progress in arms control, but instead, a dangerous arms race is taking place.	Yes
34896	In addition, they presented a suggestion that was adopted and utilized for the purpose of selecting all judges, district attorneys, or prosecuting attorneys based on their merit during my tenure.	Yes
34961	We employed the Senate Budget Committee's projections for a five-year period, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%, and we believe it can be eliminated under our proposal.	Yes
33001	Why aren't you putting some money in?	No
23604	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	No
1213	For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	Yes
16455	Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	Yes
35835	Since the recession began, we have added four million new jobs.	Yes
2530	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	No
26656	And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	Yes
35534	I declared my commitment to providing tax relief to middle-class Americans.	Yes
23981	I questioned his judgment and his character.	No
35305	The Senate Armed Services Committee voted against the SALT II treaty by 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, and concluded that it did not meet the United States' national security interests.	Yes
24631	First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	No
35170	Senator Obama has spent more money on negative advertising than any other political campaign in history.	Yes
20652	And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	No
17209	I don't want to hear them.	No
34956	The Trump International is significantly under budget and ahead of schedule.	Yes
35717	The ability to take a brief hiatus for the birth of their child or due to illness has been granted to 12 million families without jeopardizing their employment.	Yes
18468	I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	No
34472	Nearly all economic analyses I've come across, including the Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by almost everyone, suggest that we will still have a deficit of $263 billion, even with historically strong growth.	Yes
856	I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	No
23746	But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	No
15464	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	Yes
8480	It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	No
17240	And so, we made a proposal.	No
20222	Well, we do come from different places.	No
20577	Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	No
22205	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	Yes
8759	So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	No
30058	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	No
32237	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	No
7602	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	Yes
30203	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	No
27825	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	Yes
8570	First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.	No
35306	It's time to stop having incidents like this, where Mr. Bush visited Japan and the Japanese prime minister expressed empathy for our nation.	Yes
7709	Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	No
22235	Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	No
35356	It's true that this is a worldwide initiative.	Yes
24408	It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.	Yes
34580	My campaign has no PAC funding.	Yes
34909	Regrettably, a significant number of toddlers have injured themselves or killed others with firearms because not everyone who has guns in their homes takes necessary precautions.	Yes
35263	I have learned that it has been prolonged until next year.	Yes
10931	So here's what I would do.	No
21341	So what is the answer?	No
7860	In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	No
12915	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	No
20173	I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	No
28221	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	No
8952	And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	Yes
27554	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	No
5853	And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	No
10611	I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	No
18271	And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	No
7597	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	No
24622	To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	No
13799	He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.	Yes
19856	I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	Yes
11602	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	No
8327	Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	No
3329	Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.	Yes
6831	It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	No
11999	I think that measures like these are important.	No
767	The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	No
14863	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	No
4400	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	No
28807	The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	No
18900	We have to do this job.	No
35202	It's worth noting that we had a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered the governor as effectively as this one does to the President.	Yes
25862	America owes you a debt of gratitude.	No
8135	These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	No
23566	I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	No
19195	That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.	Yes
22821	A president's job is to win the peace.	No
21403	I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	No
29646	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	Yes
26485	And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	Yes
1386	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	No
17690	One final point if I might.	No
13126	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	No
26234	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	No
15712	We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.	Yes
17161	I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	No
15642	And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	No
6372	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	No
28782	That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	No
25009	I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.	No
34860	In the first half of 1980, there was a decrease of less than 2 percent in productivity.	Yes
29207	It's very important to me.	No
27754	How strong is our economy?	No
33457	People are going to pour into our country.	No
21473	But that's what I feel.	No
17878	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	No
2277	As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	No
521	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	No
32705	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	Yes
34782	The economy's economic dynamics have seen a 25 percent increase in revenues and taxes over the past three years.	Yes
8374	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	No
25216	"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	Yes
20165	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	No
25991	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	No
30163	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	No
35849	The number of warheads aimed at us today has increased by more than 2,000 since his inauguration, but it does not provide any additional support.	Yes
34922	Mr. Perot intends to do the same thing.	Yes
29474	And when you look at what you are proposing...	No
33503	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	No
3319	It's a matter of morality.	No
32167	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	No
6927	It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	No
34837	Upon arriving in Washington as a governor, I discovered the presence of thirteen federal agencies responsible for managing the drug treatment program for drug addicts.	Yes
7875	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	Yes
29952	It doesn't work that way.	No
34869	Qatar and Saudi Arabia contributed $25 million each.	Yes
8450	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.	No
28227	We do so in my state of Texas.	No
34745	Our universities have become more diverse as a result.	Yes
19671	Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	Yes
35437	There were 12 original copies that were not submitted to the CIA's printing process.	Yes
6498	"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	No
19795	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	No
5743	I've got the scars to prove it.	No
5515	Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	No
35357	Independent studies have found that my tax relief to middle-class families is three times greater than Senator McCain's, based on our respective plans.	Yes
29382	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	No
2326	Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.	Yes
35586	Prior to the president's invasion, Iraq was nowhere near the center of the war on terror.	Yes
8307	The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	Yes
6686	We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
14470	Now, in 1984 they were told.	No
2092	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	Yes
12164	And they get health care.	Yes
33787	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	Yes
34656	You have slashed the drug czar's office by 83 percent.	Yes
27956	And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	Yes
25037	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	No
34543	Due to the unique circumstances and coalition we had helped create, we were able to prevent the massacre in Libya when we entered the country.	Yes
19668	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	No
165	Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.	No
33357	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	No
20412	Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	No
133	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	No
13868	We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	No
12106	One, we need more community health centers.	No
26348	Now we have a majority and we get a president.	No
4041	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	No
15381	Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	No
23720	And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.	No
24771	Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	No
11166	... to -- to -- to...	No
2336	That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	Yes
29272	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
35661	Small businesses have created more than 300,000 jobs, which is a positive outcome.	Yes
11861	I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	No
15791	I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	No
26320	We're not going to touch Medicare.	No
32104	Oh, you didn't delete them?	No
3284	Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	No
1780	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	No
29616	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	Yes
13260	Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	Yes
8558	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	No
15020	Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	Yes
29236	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	Yes
8530	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	No
6357	But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	Yes
27920	When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.	Yes
24519	You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	No
7642	We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	No
18546	Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.	No
10830	"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	No
1492	I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.	No
14729	We're living in an interconnected world.	No
5925	She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	Yes
17884	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	No
1555	"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	No
6176	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	Yes
21116	Let me tell you what your plan is.	No
12010	Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	No
8177	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	No
22281	We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	No
7295	I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	Yes
14410	The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.	No
33705	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	Yes
35569	According to Hillary, in the ninth month, it is permissible to remove a baby from its mother's uterus just before delivery.	Yes
8674	fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	No
35189	The issue of Social Security has been resolved through bipartisan legislation that is sound for the next century.	Yes
28445	I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	No
9393	I'd get rid of it.	No
2839	I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	No
27292	Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...	No
33471	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	Yes
20105	I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	Yes
7915	It - my view is the same as his.	No
23117	Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.	Yes
22108	I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	No
15702	If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	No
1008	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.	No
14538	Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.	No
99	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	No
30303	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	No
27990	I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	No
26483	Let me just give you one tiny example.	No
15370	But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	No
18877	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	No
4158	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	No
27851	We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	No
13386	Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.	No
3926	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	Yes
6343	And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	No
21901	If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	No
32681	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	Yes
3927	And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	No
8244	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	No
29443	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	Yes
22792	We didn't have enough forces.	No
1379	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	Yes
16947	I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	No
29356	Secretary, you have no plan.	No
24438	The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	No
35095	Similarly, McKinsey and Company's study revealed that 30 percent of American businesses are expecting to remove individuals from insurance coverage.	Yes
25050	I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	No
34463	Mr. Ford is altering his previous ideology considerably.	Yes
15925	But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	No
13304	We can't settle for anything but the best.	No
22008	It's still the most respected credit.	No
24561	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	No
21408	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	No
35213	Half of the college graduates will be graduating this year without a college degree, and they won't have employment opportunities.	Yes
34915	Just like how you believe you would have ended the war in Iraq, you recently spoke about the need to increase the number of occupants by 20,000.	Yes
6021	Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	Yes
9824	It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	Yes
24906	A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	No
2032	Well, we've had this discussion before.	No
7087	In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	Yes
12516	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	No
23069	You know what he did?	No
35048	The combination of $150 billion in interest alone, 25 percent of high school dropouts, homeless individuals, and a third of veterans living on the streets without money make it impossible for us to be satisfied.	Yes
230	But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	No
29152	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	Yes
17906	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	No
13431	The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	Yes
13734	Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	Yes
2046	I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	No
35097	The vouchers are only available to a select group of students, who do not have to pay the full tuition fees to attend private schools.	Yes
20265	And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.	No
17758	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	No
12088	We believe in tough love.	No
3280	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	Yes
11035	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	No
24441	I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	Yes
35713	The primary battles are being fought in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.	Yes
8604	Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	No
18470	As the politics change, his positions change.	No
7028	I heard more of the same.	No
7149	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	No
15600	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	No
26576	We can invite all the candidates.	No
21223	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	No
17908	And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	No
35639	His record of racist behavior is a long one.	Yes
35791	We reduced those three hundred by a factor of two, including agencies.	Yes
12644	I believe that the world is changing fast.	No
35084	You've created a Strategic Defense Initiative, launched an agency, and are testing it, discussing deployment, with earmarks of around $30 billion.	Yes
29319	And I have done a lot...	No
34566	Recently, he mentioned that a potential meeting with the prime minister of Spain was not on the table as it could be due to his uncertainty about their alignment with ours.	Yes
34670	The Embassy was destroyed a few weeks ago, and there were no necessary actions taken.	Yes
34434	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	No
13944	Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	No
6597	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	Yes
26811	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	Yes
3336	Let me restate uh - our policy.	No
1350	And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	No
1691	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	No
25448	But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.	No
18015	And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.	No
17522	That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	No
23962	Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.	Yes
29230	We have to stop them from leaving.	No
8192	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	No
13465	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	No
21588	I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	No
17153	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	No
23231	One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	Yes
19815	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	Yes
23055	You know what he said?	No
14710	It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.	Yes
26352	But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	Yes
24605	I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.	No
7766	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	No
24768	So we don't have the best.	No
13021	We're on the side of freedom.	No
24259	So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	No
22024	On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	No
7189	I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	No
14046	And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	No
8433	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	No
35051	Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that they have a group of twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to defend its own actions to the American people.	Yes
6267	In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	No
17002	We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	No
26850	Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.	No
24835	You have to make tough calls.	No
9739	He didn't call for self-deportation.	No
13540	And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
13634	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	No
22112	Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	Yes
2406	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	Yes
10554	And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.	Yes
15295	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	No
8119	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	No
7948	I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.	No
23901	I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.	No
13184	As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	Yes
33309	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	Yes
12909	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	No
34527	The tax preferences he received in 1983 resulted in him paying slightly more than 12 percent, totaling 12.8 percent.	Yes
17503	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	No
4328	We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.	No
18453	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	No
28921	I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	No
10349	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	Yes
25638	Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	No
28452	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	No
13413	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	No
3569	So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	No
1846	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	Yes
16411	Thank you very, very much.	No
35879	He endorses the registration of firearms.	Yes
18243	We're standing with you strong.	No
32449	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	No
35009	I believe Governor Carter has indicated that he supports a $30 billion expenditure by the federal government on education.	Yes
24948	What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	No
4109	But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.	No
19945	It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
12932	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	No
10632	That's really part of your mistrust here.	No
19496	You're not going to worry about it anymore.	No
19664	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	No
20489	Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	No
15659	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	No
34473	He has enabled cyber attackers to break into government records, personal information, and the Democratic National Committee.	Yes
12298	I think there's a difference.	No
17094	Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	No
35714	I am not fiscally irresponsible and must choose to cancel the tax cut that the president is so determined to defend, which benefits me, my family, and Charlie.	Yes
2952	In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.	Yes
12196	And secondly, I repeat to you --	No
1127	It's a fact they did.	Yes
7612	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	No
10074	That's not what we do.	No
6994	I will not privatize it.	No
21167	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	No
35118	Three people were appointed by him and three by me to address campaign finance reform.	Yes
14677	Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	No
35423	The job we came away with enabled us to create employment opportunities for Americans.	Yes
7834	But I do not expect it to come.	No
29611	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	No
30097	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	Yes
30250	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	No
20212	I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	No
8020	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	No
3805	And we will come home with victory and with honor.	No
25260	And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	Yes
3690	We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	No
26477	We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	Yes
34871	It was my original suggestion a long time ago that we should scrutinize every government department and agency.	Yes
26693	I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.	No
10051	But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	Yes
24530	But I can tell you this.	No
8526	I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.	No
1809	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	No
23346	They're not taken care of.	No
28507	If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	No
25040	He's 3 years into this administration.	No
26432	You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	No
19808	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	Yes
35878	Despite General Petraeus' praise for the successes, he warned that they are fragile and would have been lost if we had set a specific date for withdrawal.	Yes
35172	Prior to my departure from office, we provided a $50 million refund to property taxpayers in Georgia.	Yes
11663	And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	No
35813	According to independent experts, the proposed plan could result in the creation of 10 million additional jobs.	Yes
716	Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	No
20129	A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.	No
2051	If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	No
23554	"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	Yes
11092	And I may have to make those tough decisions.	No
16055	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	No
35585	It's a rare occurrence for FOX News to dispute it, even when there are allegations about me.	Yes
27924	You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
23826	I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.	No
19548	Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.	Yes
25647	I was just going to -- --	No
16518	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	No
3146	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	Yes
35412	You've changed your mind about a timetable in Afghanistan, and now you're supporting it, even if it changes.	Yes
27478	But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	No
22691	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	No
34532	To prevent revenue loss and government depletion, I reduce deductions, credits, and exemptions to maintain a consistent flow of funds while accounting for growth.	Yes
35678	The amendment authorized the Senate of the United States to take up its position, with a majority of Senators' own and Republican representatives voting in favor of it. This is against the Senator's current position of signaling that the US will not protect the offshore islands.	Yes
17645	It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.	Yes
26777	Now that was quite an admission.	No
30410	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	No
19443	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	No
34497	Our eighth-grade students are leading the way in both English and math.	Yes
19114	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	No
32186	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	No
34586	Federal income tax is paid by half of all immigrants, who are classified as undocumented immigrants in our country.	Yes
25496	Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.	No
24269	We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	Yes
34142	They say, what do we need this for?	No
181	More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.	Yes
22567	I've argued that we should fully funded it.	No
12682	Now let's just see what this means.	No
1679	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	No
187	So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	No
11209	So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	No
10563	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	Yes
35237	He maneuvered his arms and convinced six Democrats to vote the other way, but we were ultimately defeated by one vote.	Yes
1399	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	No
32584	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
24573	I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	No
34897	Our coal can be burned within the Clean Air Act limits using our current technology.	Yes
29555	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	No
11877	Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.	No
20166	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	No
50	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
34587	Upon my realization, I'll be paying taxes in the hundreds of millions of dollars.	Yes
15557	More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.	Yes
24560	We've turned it into a weakness.	No
21098	Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	No
29147	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	No
16341	I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	No
35682	And that's just a matter of opinion.	Yes
34714	After the recession ended, the president requested a second tax cut and committed to creating 5.6 million jobs.	Yes
34612	Our focus is on turning our attention to terrorism in partnership with NATO, the world's longest-serving military alliance.	Yes
23780	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	No
19127	But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.	No
35592	My statement was that we would offer guarantees, which led to these companies being able to escape bankruptcy.	Yes
33595	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	No
6077	We need to have more community health centers.	No
35814	The spending only saw a 4 percent rise.	Yes
13932	I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.	No
15945	And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided	No
27090	And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	No
13630	I want to do something about that.	No
34997	In addition, we observe that the Congress has experienced a significant increase in the number of employees hired in recent years, surpassing the gross national product by more than any other measure in our society.	Yes
5911	And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	No
705	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	Yes
12572	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	No
26637	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	No
21014	We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.	Yes
19968	That's what our message is to the people watching.	No
24696	The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	Yes
21224	It has been a good, lively exchange.	No
342	There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.	Yes
17805	That's why I want another 4 years.	No
11660	We have to work with Nigeria.	No
11939	And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.	No
27353	Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	Yes
18554	But I have a plan to do it.	No
21543	That's not specific in terms of a program.	No
13460	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	No
23445	Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	Yes
3363	I believe we can and we ought to.	No
12017	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	Yes
25461	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	No
20008	Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	Yes
7020	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	Yes
10249	We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	No
23693	I did the right decision.	No
7831	This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.	No
21174	They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	No
17126	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	No
344	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	No
35026	The nuclear weapons are not being taken down entirely.	Yes
880	When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	No
34668	The Washington Post and its extensive study suggest that a $100 billion problem will befall us after the election, if you believe it.	Yes
24709	I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.	Yes
10223	A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.	Yes
19139	For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	Yes
24428	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	No
16152	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	No
34991	I vetoed the product liability bill that was passed by them, and I believed it was related to this issue.	Yes
17882	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	No
33029	And you look at our miners.	No
334	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	No
5848	You know, here's what I would say.	No
1348	That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	No
34828	I provided a chance to all draft evaders and deserters in September 1974, inviting them to come forward and clear their records with the intention of regaining their good citizenship.	Yes
35066	I backed the V-chip, which would enable parents to manage their children's television viewing habits and the ratings systems for TV and educational content.	Yes
10185	We're starting to see gains in math and science.	Yes
10763	There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	No
22584	Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	No
15492	But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	No
28457	So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	No
18533	I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	No
35710	The Soviet Union is no longer in existence and we're cooperating with a democratic state.	Yes
11994	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	No
12648	And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.	No
18810	It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	Yes
11563	IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	No
17687	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	Yes
17657	We didn't think that was right.	No
12359	I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	No
1532	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	No
34971	The voucher's inability to keep up with health care inflation resulted in an estimated annual cost of $6,000 for the average senior.	Yes
3158	We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	Yes
35531	Home loans have been the subject of more than thirteen hundred indictments and over eight hundred convictions on HUD's behalf.	Yes
33653	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	No
4217	It had everything to do with energy.	No
35120	North Korea has obtained nuclear weapons in the meantime.	Yes
20063	I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.	Yes
8275	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	Yes
21840	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	Yes
34811	In the event that you earn over $25,000 annually and receive no assistance from the Bush prescription drug proposal for four to five years, you may be required to switch to a Medicare or insurance company plan, which does not have any restrictions on premiums, deductibles.	Yes
22902	We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.	No
16713	We need to shift from oil to coal.	No
19011	It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	No
27684	And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	No
19286	It's a good package, Mr. President.	No
23859	I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.	No
26201	As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	No
1844	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	Yes
23630	I'm trying to decipher that.	No
26370	He said it would hurt the economy.	No
11889	And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	No
6628	And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	No
34968	I have affirmed my support for a balanced budget during debates and in the ongoing debate throughout my fourteen years in Congress.	Yes
28934	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	No
34661	Small businesses make up the majority of our jobs, accounting for two-thirds.	Yes
33955	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	No
26538	We need to deal with managed care.	No
27809	That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	No
20557	It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.	No
29573	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	No
3536	And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	No
2996	When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	Yes
29051	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	No
367	And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	No
6870	He has no record on reforming of health care.	Yes
16464	We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	Yes
57	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	No
21498	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	Yes
20969	But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	No
16250	I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	No
7950	Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	No
32282	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	Yes
12614	What are freedom's chances in those areas?	No
22494	I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	Yes
34757	You stated that the unemployment rate would be 5.4 percent by now.	Yes
28982	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	No
7985	Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	No
3882	They just passed an electoral...	No
25	We have to change this whole culture.	No
25068	Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	No
17234	We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	No
35231	Since the Great Depression, Mr. Ford's administration has recorded the highest unemployment rate in our nation.	Yes
23053	John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.	No
3902	The question is, was this wise?	No
3168	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	No
34849	A child who is under 18 years old will be charged $500.	Yes
28593	But that's the good news.	No
26065	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	No
29586	That was more than a mistake.	No
620	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	No
1814	I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	No
18985	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	No
613	We're going to have to-the MX.	No
30327	Can they rely on us?	No
1420	Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	No
13398	Now, what do we do about it?	No
33279	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	No
2349	It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	Yes
30212	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	Yes
14164	I look on this as history.	No
18137	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	Yes
8883	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	No
24912	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	No
15223	We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.	Yes
12240	We have to be bold.	No
24714	So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	No
6774	What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.	No
7196	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	Yes
3580	But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.	No
3459	It has to have accountability and oversight.	No
26633	And that's the economic package again.	No
7232	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	No
17583	From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	Yes
3550	You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	Yes
7083	There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	No
23986	What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.	No
31963	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	No
16792	"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	No
25689	Sometimes the views have been distorted.	No
17454	In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	Yes
10782	The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	No
236	The NIH is doing a good job in research.	No
27681	It's important for the success of Afghanistan.	No
32183	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	No
24411	I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	Yes
34784	They receive $145 in tax relief under Vice President Gore's proposal.	Yes
15684	The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	No
10801	And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	Yes
24169	This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	Yes
35425	Therefore, I have never proposed that we should be able to pay off the debt in significant amounts or at all within nineteen years.	Yes
10393	That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	No
2222	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	No
35016	The proceedings were heard by a judge who was highly anti-police.	Yes
7419	We have to change that.	No
201	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	Yes
15926	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	No
1677	It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	No
6861	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	Yes
22247	Those schools belong to you.	No
35031	Even though he promised to reduce state Government spending, it increased from $4.6 billion in 1967 to $10.2 billion during his eight-year term.	Yes
11957	I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
8234	It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
18815	We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	Yes
3818	We hadn't caught bin Laden.	Yes
29657	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	No
35269	What actions will you take to ensure that people remember that you signed the most significant tax increase in both California and the United States?	Yes
17535	I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	Yes
20892	Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	No
11992	If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.	No
17577	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	No
35289	During your time as a member of the Woods Foundation's board, you and Mr. Ayers contributed $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
16769	For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	Yes
7017	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	No
35857	In the last seven and a half years, we have generated more hydroelectric power than any other administration in history.	Yes
35023	I would have taken it across the country and invited every law enforcement officer in the nation to visit those lawmakers.	Yes
34783	It's important to note that our military spending has gone up every year since I took office.	Yes
2886	I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	No
2002	But you've been -- but you've been president four years...	No
27137	That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	No
14277	We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.	Yes
35616	The defense budget, which is composed of two-thirds of pay and salary or pension, should be made known to the public.	Yes
5850	I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	No
12391	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	No
17861	By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	Yes
1894	We created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
10915	And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	No
19541	We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	Yes
27584	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	No
13238	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	No
17565	Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	No
34672	During the 5 years before our election, taxes in the United States doubled and budgets increased by $318 billion.	Yes
16271	That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	No
25001	I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	No
1398	I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	No
4162	So let me get this right.	No
12183	I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.	No
26662	I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	Yes
32664	She talks in favor of the rebels.	Yes
33229	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	Yes
34965	The total economy was impacted by one seventh, which also included 17 new taxes, price controls, and 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that incurred costs of $1.5 trillion.	Yes
22365	I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	No
709	And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	No
1882	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.	Yes
2231	Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.	Yes
15882	I think the American people would appreciate that.	No
21797	And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.	No
32998	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	Yes
23852	I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	No
1016	No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	Yes
22298	It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	No
161	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	Yes
7253	The people I talked to their spirits were high.	No
10800	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	Yes
27914	And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	Yes
8392	I think we're going to have to do it.	No
3585	That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	No
16021	George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.	Yes
13738	And the people who have jobs --	No
14765	Who's the best person to get results and not talk?	No
35205	A $1,000 deduction is available for those who are in the care of an elderly parent.	Yes
6777	And that's why I support that.	No
18031	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	No
25564	The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	Yes
28504	The governor proposes $45 billion.	Yes
17716	We're going to see that it doesn't.	No
12970	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
22012	One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	No
34502	The president was given a national intelligence assessment in July, which concluded that the worst-case scenario would involve civil war.	Yes
27670	This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.	No
21018	Too many people have been left behind.	No
21609	And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	No
894	I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	No
34875	We've doubled down on all other aspects and through research.	Yes
11704	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	Yes
16063	I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	No
19910	But this is a very liberal administration.	No
34518	Six months from now, I had not made it clear that I would be bringing out the troops.	Yes
33785	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
35506	The number of Members of Congress who have been under investigation by percentage comparisons is higher than that of the executive branch.	Yes
21969	I'll tell you how it's affected me.	No
17570	As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.	No
14691	Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.	Yes
7791	And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	Yes
14032	And it goes on and on.	No
6760	You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.	No
5731	So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	Yes
2655	I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	No
19611	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	Yes
28188	And we have uninsured people in my state.	No
12995	He's been in some other country.	No
7256	My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.	No
25974	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	No
16202	I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	No
3286	This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	No
3281	On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	Yes
8785	And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	Yes
24281	So we have two that I'd put as number one.	No
10972	And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.	Yes
20057	They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	No
14931	And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	Yes
16127	I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	No
27269	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	No
8555	Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	Yes
14840	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	No
634	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	No
34640	The idea of working on welfare reform began in 1980 when I grew tired of seeing people trapped in a system that was isolating them and making their children more susceptible to mistreatment.	Yes
13938	I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?	No
9064	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	No
26722	Let me very briefly give you some examples.	No
2115	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.	No
4247	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	No
12260	And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.	No
21362	Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	No
10628	The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	No
15424	The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	No
14636	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	No
6845	People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	No
18623	Never wanted to commit troops.	No
2439	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	No
24850	Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.	No
918	I oppose supply management and production controls.	No
34202	No, you are the one that's unfit.	No
28698	But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	No
35429	With a greater number of troops in 60 nations, they are the adversary.	Yes
26418	We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	Yes
30364	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	No
7187	Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	No
29702	We have to restore trust.	No
6936	Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	No
4116	There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.	No
32161	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	Yes
25854	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	Yes
17480	I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	No
18969	And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	No
29441	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	No
1418	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	No
35487	At the time of his inauguration, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent, but it is currently at 7.8%.	Yes
8915	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	Yes
14629	And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	No
16870	And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	No
141	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	No
9645	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	No
21832	I don't want to stampede.	No
28601	I want to change those provisions.	No
8038	Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.	No
7112	He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	No
11497	One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	No
30	Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	No
22274	At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	No
24664	Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	No
20957	They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	Yes
35340	We have a low utilization of our productive capacity, which is around 73 percent. The unemployment rate is currently at 7.9 percent, and we still need to increase the number of available jobs before inflation becomes an issue.	Yes
462	And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	No
23087	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	Yes
25512	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	No
35823	After being backed by the Administration, we were defeated in the Senate with just one vote.	Yes
35603	Despite this, it should be noted that Donald began his career in 1973 when he was sued for racial discrimination by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans. He made sure that those who worked for him were aware of this policy.	Yes
3956	Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	No
28570	None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	No
35207	He has broken it three times in the past year.	Yes
22422	I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	No
1057	But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	No
8512	The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.	No
26728	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	No
15868	Those are basic American values.	No
25820	It's about where we are now.	No
21308	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	No
2720	And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	No
14914	The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	No
30160	The record does not show that.	Yes
8206	We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.	Yes
35509	It is my opinion that the Senate, consisting of a majority of Democrats and Republicans, was correct in their rejections of Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	Yes
8383	#NAME?	No
28828	Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	No
19970	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	No
31921	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	No
16440	We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	No
26385	The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	Yes
509	We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	Yes
16892	They spend too much money on themselves.	No
10821	That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	No
2399	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.	Yes
4042	And when I'm president, I will.	No
16399	This election is about big things.	No
8601	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	No
21415	In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	Yes
30407	Where did you find this?	No
15871	They're not left or right.	No
262	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	No
6068	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	No
35632	In the past 4 years, there has been an increase of almost $3,000 in personal earnings per capita after taxes.	Yes
25760	They're looking to us for leadership.	No
35180	We lowered the marriage penalty for those who are married.	Yes
2430	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	No
14220	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	No
20897	We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.	No
14367	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	Yes
35208	Her e-mails, which were destroyed criminally after being subpoenaed by the United States Congress, are not fictionalized in any way.	Yes
26708	And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	No
14085	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	No
35542	I've maintained a consistent record since 1965.	Yes
6368	Well, thank you again, Bob.	No
2393	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	No
13851	Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	No
14127	Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	No
14031	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	Yes
7864	He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	No
35359	The nuclear fuel cycle was mastered by them during the Bush administration.	Yes
17192	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	No
889	Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	No
34758	Our current score is below 285 as compared to what we were before.	Yes
17031	In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	No
35298	Unless your home is worth more than 500,000 dollars, we are part of the Dole-Kemp economic plan.	Yes
24946	And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	Yes
3156	Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	Yes
34359	I want to invest in your family.	No
24046	They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	No
14813	Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	No
25249	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	No
10698	And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	No
32448	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
14431	And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.	Yes
35549	By reducing Federal taxes, as I suggested about a year ago, we can achieve the same outcome. Private taxpayers will receive 75% of the tax reduction, while the business sector will get 25%.	Yes
35453	At the time of Mr. Nixon's famous speech on Operation Independence, we were importing roughly 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
19559	And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	No
35874	Our actions over the past eight years have led to a more secure situation.	Yes
34526	I have never suggested that the law should be enacted if there is proof that it cannot be accomplished.	Yes
26938	Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	No
18096	As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	Yes
24949	He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	No
35092	North Korea presently has between four and seven nuclear weapons at its disposal.	Yes
2368	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	Yes
1465	Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
34950	I have consistently emphasized that I will not increase taxes on individuals earning less than $250,000 during this campaign.	Yes
35077	The previous Administration's classrooms were three times larger than those built during the Truman administration, and Eisenhower is now being discussed in relation to schools.	Yes
6643	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	Yes
26774	But we're not there yet.	No
29128	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	Yes
33247	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	No
23644	I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	No
11724	Our military is meant to fight and win war.	No
35821	The reason I want to see lower taxes for middle-income taxpayers is that they have been buried over the past four years.	Yes
18408	So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.	No
16639	And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	Yes
28471	I've worked on that long and hard.	No
7665	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	No
14893	Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.	Yes
3445	And I do have a sad note tonight.	No
29695	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	Yes
33057	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	Yes
24910	And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	Yes
26114	We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	Yes
7840	We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.	Yes
34836	We have a diverse range of agreements on file, and some are currently being implemented to eliminate nuclear weapons.	Yes
21971	I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	Yes
8951	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	Yes
17023	Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	Yes
18204	And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	No
21806	Let's start with a premise.	No
19642	So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	No
26828	I promise you the economy is going to get better.	No
3435	Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.	No
19207	We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	Yes
8578	Not at all Because these are determined men.	No
27258	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	No
17451	And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	Yes
35294	He has raised taxes on multiple occasions.	Yes
15255	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	Yes
16247	There will be no more debates.	No
32728	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	No
7613	In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	No
26630	Did you say you're unemployed?	No
20963	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	No
26528	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	No
25758	But it is very important.	No
15373	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	No
105	Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	No
19711	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	No
17871	We have 543 at present.	Yes
9473	Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	No
34055	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	Yes
23029	Just want to make sure they're safe.	No
14409	Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	No
8810	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	No
6991	We paid down the debt for two years.	Yes
26367	Senator Dole led the opposition to it.	No
29699	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	No
27675	We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	No
18003	I've shown the American people I know how to lead.	No
8343	I have met with the legislative leaders.	No
15911	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
35696	A trainload of TNT would be spread across the entire nation if 50 tons of it were added to each railroad car.	Yes
11557	The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	No
34430	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	No
19181	In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.	Yes
15657	What was he referring to?	No
35911	In the process, we have achieved a net saving of $9 billion.	Yes
35732	The national economy has experienced a negative growth in real dollars over the past two years, with President Ford's administration having generated 125 billion dollars in deficits and more than doubled the number of bankruptcies for small businesses.	Yes
35272	I never made the point -- and you can't tell me where I said it -- that in April I gave a long environmental speech about why we should aim to increase fuel efficiency to 40 miles per gallon.	Yes
16005	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	No
26016	But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	No
9599	That's not what you did in that generation.	No
19360	They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	No
26179	6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	Yes
6972	And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.	No
7159	"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."	Yes
22100	Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	Yes
34873	The atomic energy lobby has persuaded Mr. Ford to allow private industry to carry out reprocessing or enrichment, rather than the current government plants.	Yes
3243	He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	Yes
13321	Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	No
2214	They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.	No
24567	We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	No
29434	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	No
31890	I apologize to the American people.	No
33097	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	No
27513	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	No
17397	All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	Yes
35431	We failed to secure 850,000 tons of ammo.	Yes
1969	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	No
22040	To get the interest rates down.	No
20805	Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	No
16706	We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	No
33467	If we got along well, that would be good.	No
33750	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	Yes
34571	It's worth noting that Donald is hinting at his lack of support for the Iraq war.	Yes
15606	And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	Yes
16657	We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.	Yes
34655	Furthermore, we decrease taxes for all individuals.	Yes
25013	So, I can say there are a great many interests.	No
2810	Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.	Yes
8619	If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	No
35624	Despite changing his mind four times in recent days, Governor Reagan has still advocated for the adoption of a voluntary Social Security system that would effectively bring it to an early close.	Yes
30389	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	No
15490	We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	No
15346	So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	No
2914	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
10735	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	No
17148	I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	No
35885	The defense sector has been reduced by me.	Yes
18110	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	No
19531	They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.	Yes
8384	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	No
17724	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	No
33313	It means their job is tougher.	No
1603	We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.	No
6949	That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	Yes
22458	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	No
571	The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	No
22649	I always believed he was a threat.	No
15644	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	No
23235	I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	No
15008	And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	No
35876	The commanders in Afghanistan and Admiral Mullen have acknowledged that our troops are not adequately prepared to handle Afghanistan, as we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
9183	Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	No
724	And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	Yes
403	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	No
25817	We've always had at least 7 percent.	Yes
7667	And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	No
13092	I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	No
34080	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	No
35647	"Mr. Levi, the attorney general of the former senator, proposed a gun control plan that was later supported by Mr."" I believe that the sale of Saturday Night Specials should be prohibited."	Yes
7809	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	No
35191	The US president was informed that the issue amounted to $20 billion.	Yes
34631	The most significant amount in American history, taking into account not only the major ones but also numerous minor ones.	Yes
9812	It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	Yes
6552	It's called bait and switch.	No
10760	That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	No
25909	He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	No
23044	And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	Yes
33251	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	No
8142	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	No
25229	For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	Yes
18585	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	No
9905	And that's what I've done administratively.	No
19409	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	No
12627	Is our strength and prestige rising?	No
18753	The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	Yes
1035	Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	No
14160	I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.	No
14867	I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	Yes
26049	Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	Yes
10046	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	No
22616	Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.	Yes
35635	The largest stock market correction in history, which predicted a recession, was the most significant one yet.	Yes
9661	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	No
15083	When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	Yes
16843	You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	Yes
31955	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	Yes
25066	And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.	Yes
34130	They want to look good.	No
29165	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	No
25363	But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.	No
23203	Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.	No
16810	And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	Yes
7784	This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	No
29110	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	No
35744	If you have a health care plan that you feel is suitable, you can choose to keep it.	Yes
27480	There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.	No
24704	When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	No
1245	I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.	No
32776	So I think that could help.	No
25053	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	No
18987	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	No
8023	It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.	No
8083	It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	No
10032	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	Yes
10835	You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?	Yes
5626	If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	Yes
21394	So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	No
16603	Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.	No
34676	He crossed the red line in the sand and made numerous errors.	Yes
21660	The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.	No
3261	We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	No
35828	The cost of gasoline has increased from $.80 to around $1.30 since I proposed it 15 months ago.	Yes
15529	And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	No
18034	And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	No
16383	We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	No
35715	The loss of health insurance coverage for five million people has been caused by this president.	Yes
9499	And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	No
12782	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	No
6537	And there is no system.	No
28119	I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	No
32862	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	No
7676	About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	Yes
7868	President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	No
34801	The job is exceptionally well done by Innermountain Healthcare, Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic.	Yes
28201	We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	No
34330	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	No
24254	And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	No
14256	And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.	Yes
16563	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	Yes
34367	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	No
14135	I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	No
26689	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	Yes
19188	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
9277	20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.	Yes
22047	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	No
15229	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	No
12200	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	Yes
30387	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	Yes
15236	The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	Yes
2149	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	No
8358	I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	No
19852	Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	No
8548	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	Yes
16690	This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	Yes
7285	Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.	No
12114	And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	Yes
111	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	No
23106	Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	No
21456	I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	No
28567	Let me tell you my position.	No
3160	This has got to be stopped.	No
28537	I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.	No
25417	Now, why do I support the freeze?	No
25746	There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	No
33031	There is a thing called clean coal.	No
8899	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	Yes
16199	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	No
35338	We have progressed from the greatest inefficiencies to the largest surpluses.	Yes
20509	First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	No
35114	It's not true, Governor Romney.	Yes
6040	Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	Yes
22887	It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	Yes
15253	We cannot cast aside these regulations.	No
7807	This we must get across to the world.	No
698	So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	No
12222	The horse is up here now.	No
19432	This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	No
34107	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	No
17379	But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	No
32015	So you really owe him an apology.	No
7914	I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.	No
13084	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	No
32721	Let me tell you something.	No
12868	I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	No
35511	We have experienced a significant surge in our exports.	Yes
16349	Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	No
7641	We lost three thousand American lives.	Yes
19198	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	No
2476	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	No
12071	And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	No
19381	So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	No
20230	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	Yes
11983	Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.	No
18219	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	No
22192	So we've got to innovate through school choice.	No
8834	We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	No
24475	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	No
35103	"He expressed dissatisfaction with the inadequate equipment of his troops and voted against the $87 billion supplemental I submitted to the Congress, but later released a remarkable statement: ""I actually supported the proposed amount before my vote."""	Yes
46	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
23413	Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.	Yes
19783	That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	No
35894	The increasing presence of the enemy in more places, states, and nations is making it increasingly challenging to defeat them.	Yes
32772	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	No
27262	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	No
8031	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	No
33325	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	No
26322	The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.	No
29556	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	Yes
14916	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	Yes
27904	People will look it up.	No
2700	That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	No
23512	We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	No
1978	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
13908	Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	No
26618	But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.	No
20503	As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	No
29309	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	Yes
13328	I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.	No
25350	But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	Yes
16241	Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.	No
16345	And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	Yes
21885	And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	No
22165	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	No
7692	The right to vote is basic.	No
20390	He said all poor seniors.	No
15030	We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	No
14738	And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?	No
13543	Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.	No
14591	We are a rising nation.	Yes
12700	Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	No
15773	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	Yes
1144	He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	No
19407	Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	No
259	Well, I don't question his passion.	No
15983	I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	No
23150	They create government-sponsored health care.	Yes
35447	In Missouri, you've accumulated roughly $3,500.	Yes
30127	But I'm all for NATO.	No
12811	We ought to make one last effort.	No
15922	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	No
18118	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	No
28750	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	Yes
32350	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	Yes
19491	So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	No
7594	Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	No
28646	I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.	No
6586	I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	No
18100	But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.	No
6909	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	Yes
28558	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	No
542	But here's the point he misses.	No
19995	You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	No
27966	Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	No
1768	And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.	No
35794	Our close cooperation with the foreign ministers of France, Germany, and Great Britain has resulted in a message being communicated to the mullahs that joining the world of nations requires you to discard your nuclear programs.	Yes
33494	Hillary, you have no idea.	No
13369	But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	No
9741	In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	No
6921	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	No
1997	I have my own plan.	No
6326	Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.	No
24008	It's got to be fair.	No
3074	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	Yes
3786	So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	Yes
19736	So it's not that we always disagree.	No
470	Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	No
18848	I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	No
21248	And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.	No
33639	But we have horrible deals.	No
34152	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	No
12748	Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	No
23979	Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	No
14755	You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.	No
26530	A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	No
28044	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	No
35553	She made a lot of money by using the power of her office.	Yes
8576	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	Yes
19217	We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	No
16499	Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.	Yes
35742	Our debt is now in the trillion-dollar range due to their ownership.	Yes
17744	[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	No
3950	Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	Yes
25368	But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	No
18262	And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.	No
20638	I would be guarded in my approach.	No
18233	We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.	No
10945	He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	No
421	No, I don't think there is.	No
7863	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	No
15251	To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.	No
3986	And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	No
8156	I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	No
23655	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	No
19837	The ones that are out there are doing well.	No
28946	We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	Yes
19779	That's why we're moving in the right direction.	No
1056	Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.	Yes
34018	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	No
2481	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	No
34938	We have the highest job growth rate in the country, as well as the lowest spending at both state and local levels, and the second lowest tax burden.	Yes
1518	We are not at war.	No
391	It will require some funds, John.	No
18500	He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.	No
31867	You say who's making these deals?	No
2009	If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	Yes
10018	And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	No
16369	I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	No
29537	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	No
23403	Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	No
18394	And our alliance is strong.	No
534	It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	No
9489	He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	No
35451	Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, the government's spending has decreased to 6 percent.	Yes
35012	The federal contribution to water treatment plants has been raised by more than 60 percent under my leadership as president.	Yes
14660	The whole world has had economic problems.	No
35135	They withdrew after Sergio de Mello's death.	Yes
34694	The President exercised his American authority in Lebanon, but the way he managed it resulted in the deaths of marines, humiliation, stronger Soviet forces, and increased motivation towards terrorists.	Yes
34627	Since George Washington, Muslims have been present in America.	Yes
35755	It is my contention that President Ford, who was almost 90% of a treaty we could agree on when he left office, strongly opposes the SALT agreement, given that two Republican presidents attempted to pass it.	Yes
32991	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	No
285	I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	No
25681	Let me first give you a sports update.	No
19042	We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	No
35414	In 1988, when the Iraq-Iraq war was ending, we were aware that Saddam Hussein was a despot and had to deal with him because he was against Iran, which could be my friend.	Yes
2445	And there are ways of doing it.	No
32905	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	No
3893	And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	Yes
35454	I am against the idea of registering firearms at a national level.	Yes
34774	Lobbyists and special interests are often responsible for introducing these requests, as he correctly pointed out, but I didn't encounter this situation.	Yes
2227	That's the plan that I've put forward.	No
25630	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	No
25008	Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	No
34914	The costs of our defense systems are now so uncontrollable that they cannot be managed.	Yes
33606	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	No
23537	I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way.	No
27209	And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	No
35076	Having spent three and a half years in Washington, D.C., I have been leading the Congress in reforming Medicare to ensure that our elderly population has access to dependable healthcare.	Yes
27887	The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	No
23558	Let me make sure you understand my decision.	No
1141	It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	No
8295	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	No
5986	It's mortgaging our children's future.	No
34706	The agricultural credit bill passed by Congress is aiding and enhancing the situation for some farmers.	Yes
650	What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.	No
10878	But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.	No
23921	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	No
22858	He was deceiving the inspectors.	Yes
13595	But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	No
25352	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	No
35644	Some of our international competitors collect taxes up to $3.50 per gallon, which they use to create jobs and improve infrastructure.	Yes
32766	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	No
30184	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	No
18756	While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.	Yes
17108	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	Yes
34629	Our vote on the U.N.'s Red China vote, which was focused on Liberia and South Africa, resulted in our support being given only to two African countries.	Yes
27797	But I've made a different bet on American workers.	No
8424	We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	No
12593	He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	No
32974	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	No
16845	DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.	Yes
11713	Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	No
16251	(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	No
34622	The reason we created the plan is to ensure that six million more American families do not pay taxes.	Yes
23900	I think character is a very important question.	No
16385	Thank you, and God bless you.	No
35668	It is effective when we ensure housing for them, as was done in the previous military budgets.	Yes
17354	And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	No
8610	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	No
32803	She called it the gold standard.	Yes
34993	The number of people working harder for less money is increasing, and 100,000 individuals are losing their health insurance every month. Additionally, unemployment rates are rising, leading to a slowerdown in our economy.	Yes
34767	Whenever the Congress has proposed amendments, the Republican administration has delayed implementation dates for automobile manufacturers who cannot meet them.	Yes
8445	I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	No
14610	So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	No
28688	We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	No
948	I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	No
8784	But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	Yes
13950	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	No
35070	Through my advocacy and the Congress's support, a significant mass transit program was established, costing eleven billion eight hundred million dollars over four years.	Yes
16140	That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	No
34483	She has been dishonest about a lot of things.	Yes
35470	The unemployment rate was below 4 percent.	Yes
8308	We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
16289	That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	No
16635	I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	Yes
11813	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	No
35913	It was outrageous for President Obama to have deficits as high as $600,000 during the Bush administration, according to his statement.	Yes
34491	We are the most significant contributor to alleviate the suffering of those in need worldwide.	Yes
34969	Our country has the highest cancer rate compared to other nations.	Yes
7338	This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	Yes
9488	Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	No
29056	I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	No
18588	He is the leader of that country.	No
13204	I completely sustained the treaty.	Yes
6114	And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	No
22157	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	No
8806	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	Yes
14842	The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.	Yes
27281	And those teachers can make a difference.	No
12392	I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	No
22389	I can think of many.	No
7756	They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	Yes
12210	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	Yes
17591	The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	No
11520	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	No
17712	The interest rates are based on inflation.	No
473	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	No
15936	And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	No
17651	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	Yes
12850	The Soviet Union does understand strength.	No
1382	And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	No
10082	It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	No
6405	It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	No
8160	The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	No
16811	One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	Yes
9256	And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.	No
7134	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	Yes
24634	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	No
16893	They have too many employees.	No
27804	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	No
34677	The current deficit amounts to $2.6 trillion.	Yes
25086	As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	No
35449	He engaged in bilateral discussions with the North Koreans.	Yes
22742	Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
35464	A few months later, he declared his intention to decrease the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
34662	The Senate Budget Committee scrutinized the expenses of the vice president.	Yes
18173	And there are a long list of thing.	No
11772	It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	No
11822	One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	No
4323	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	No
2616	This seems to be a trend.	No
24136	I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	No
34817	Our industrial state's low murder rate is one of the reasons why.	Yes
27985	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	No
35145	The record does not demonstrate that.	Yes
34618	He's been seen causing embarrassment to women on TV and Twitter.	Yes
7800	Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	No
21651	The president can't order Congress around.	No
8072	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	No
35091	The rate of poverty has increased, but it is not as high as it was in the previous years.	Yes
2510	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	Yes
20614	I think that's the wrong thing.	No
10562	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	No
14567	I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
27156	You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	No
16010	We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	No
16866	President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.	Yes
21259	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	No
8026	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	No
15413	First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	No
35853	We've given away entire industries.	Yes
24864	Thank you very, very much.	No
21774	I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	No
15247	But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	Yes
12658	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	Yes
35887	It's important to mention that during the eight years we were engaged in a war that was not as brutal as it had been before, leading to alterations in military expenditure.	Yes
11891	There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	No
2662	It's because I care about education for all of our kids.	No
3375	It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.	No
16886	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	No
2506	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	No
14711	More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	Yes
22721	We're going to train troops, and we are.	No
18712	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	No
8399	Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	No
19981	This is about getting the economy moving again.	No
26779	It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	No
15401	It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.	No
9069	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	No
9290	And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	No
32321	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	Yes
20583	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	No
12781	And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.	No
23963	So that is where my income limit would trigger.	No
15811	I think of Dr. Fauci.	No
29496	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	No
587	I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	No
26781	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	No
970	We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	No
23244	Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	Yes
12607	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	Yes
24730	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	No
19798	I also want a bridge to the truth.	No
9999	And it's time for them to get serious on it.	No
4108	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	No
34700	The northern region of Mali has been seized by al-Qaeda-type groups.	Yes
24095	The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	Yes
34484	Middle- income Americans have experienced a decrease of $4,300 in their income.	Yes
16536	Keep my promises to the American people.	No
34866	"Due to her Latino background, he gave her the nickname ""Miss Housekeeping."""	Yes
4405	That's where I get my name.	No
24836	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	No
16358	This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	No
3379	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	No
32779	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	No
25093	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	No
26431	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	Yes
25791	And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.	No
8479	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	Yes
29598	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	No
15342	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	No
24374	We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	Yes
5794	Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	Yes
22989	We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.	No
16850	But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	No
23007	And I accept what the president has said.	No
24747	But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.	Yes
34723	The law explicitly forbids that.	Yes
35002	At the moment, the president is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in researching nuclear weapons that can be destroyed as bunkers.	Yes
24606	So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	No
9652	In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	Yes
29465	Then you didn't read it.	No
33484	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	No
30194	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	No
1581	And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	Yes
2964	Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	Yes
13190	We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	No
35862	Bosnia was the most terrible war in Europe when I became president.	Yes
10950	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	No
19109	We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
19961	And so I think you take a look at it.	No
22367	This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	No
16807	It shows a lack of leadership.	No
35435	Even though Senator McCain would have argued for vouchers, I disagree with him on the matter as it does not provide enough information to support his school's goal of adding 2,000 more slots to the voucher program in D.C.	Yes
34874	Mr. Mondale appears to support MAD, which stands for mutual destruction, meaning that any nuclear attack on our nation will result in the death of yours as well as ours.	Yes
13770	And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	Yes
6926	The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	Yes
1578	As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	Yes
823	Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.Ã¢â€°Â¤	Yes
9865	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	No
26582	Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	No
35043	I am aware that the Department of State and Defense have endorsed the veracity of both the current report and the previous report, as well as the National Security Agency.	Yes
25870	I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	Yes
34734	Every year, the amount of money that was taxed - there were occasionally exceptions -- increased.	Yes
3601	And I pay for every dime of it.	No
35101	Haiti is the most impoverished nation in our region.	Yes
19406	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	Yes
25245	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	No
19132	It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	No
10474	You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.	Yes
34557	Our efforts resulted in the establishment of 23 million new jobs.	Yes
8466	And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	Yes
3068	These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	No
8803	we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	Yes
13639	We've got to pay it back.	No
8428	I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	No
35303	It is highly unjustifiable for someone to cross the border and become a citizen under her plan, which allows for open borders.	Yes
5919	They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	No
26677	They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	No
24197	Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.	No
8257	Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	No
20333	It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	No
3790	On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.	No
21326	And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	Yes
20300	There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	No
20592	And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	No
35554	Upon taking office, we discovered that the national parks were unhygienic and had numerous hazards and inadequate safety features, prompting us to discontinue purchasing more park land until a 5-year initiative was completed, which is almost complete, costing billion dollars.	Yes
34445	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	No
18723	Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	Yes
6167	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	No
1099	I don't have a response.	No
34851	Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase for the wealthy that provided middle-class taxpayers with some relief, only this year.	Yes
8441	The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	No
7995	You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	Yes
32891	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	No
35413	Mr. Bush is the one who raised taxes on the middle class after stating that he would not.	Yes
19367	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	Yes
26733	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	No
13884	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	Yes
16609	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	Yes
22974	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	No
24332	There's no question about that.	No
26904	And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	No
27093	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	No
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
33173	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	No
1959	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	No
19117	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	No
11735	That's really about all we can do.	No
16801	This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	No
5769	That, to me, was so hurtful.	No
9031	I happen to believe it is.	No
35155	The number of unemployed individuals has reached seven and a half million.	Yes
33037	I will bring our energy companies back.	No
13956	I just have an honest philosophical difference.	No
457	I haven't sorted out the penalties.	No
2316	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	Yes
18446	I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.	Yes
24904	This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	No
35829	Since the War between States that vetoed additional bills, we've never had a president.	Yes
7040	People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.	Yes
15798	Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	No
34702	As you may already know, I am the first president to have reorganized the intelligence agencies within the federal government, such as the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, and National Security Agency.	Yes
12642	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	Yes
35726	During the early stages of my presidency, I reached out to the attorney general and U.S. attorneys and established a task force across the country to handle individuals who use firearms to commit crimes.	Yes
20801	He decides who the right people are.	No
19882	You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	No
22480	They're not going to be solved overnight.	No
33424	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	No
27741	It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	Yes
9137	And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	No
21159	And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	No
35494	The insurance companies contend that it won't be effective and refuse to provide these plans.	Yes
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
12376	Well, we all make mistakes.	No
34639	The jobs being created by the president are losing out on $9,000.	Yes
34098	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	No
22194	But she is absolutely right.	No
3498	But there's also the issue of responsibility.	No
11402	Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	No
27300	And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.	Yes
34891	The president declared his intention to reduce the deficit by half.	Yes
35343	One-fifth of our gross national product is allocated to health care.	Yes
10505	Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	No
32543	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	No
32359	Well, I just want to say...	No
3230	This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	Yes
3812	And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.	No
23695	Now, you asked what mistakes.	No
18010	And that's what they are.	No
8208	We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.	Yes
8942	Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.	No
233	I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.	No
28310	We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	No
7144	Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	Yes
6044	We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	No
22334	This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	No
16599	This needs to be changed.	No
31904	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	No
21978	It is because we have not grown.	No
18215	And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	No
27556	And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.	No
21304	We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.	Yes
34515	The Joint Chiefs of Staff's former chief, Admiral Mullen, stated that our debt is the most significant threat to national security.	Yes
15446	Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	No
34493	Firstly, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion are not true.	Yes
7921	It's going to be a test of our strength.	No
8152	I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	No
22102	New world order to me means freedom and democracy.	No
24044	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	No
35430	We had decreased it to roughly 13% in the second quarter.	Yes
31848	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	No
11668	I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.	No
12938	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	Yes
11929	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	No
17873	I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.	Yes
24502	But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	No
3982	And I know how to work with them.	No
26366	The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.	Yes
8076	This is what I deeply believe.	No
7721	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	Yes
3172	We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.	Yes
25145	-- me, or your own eyes?''	No
35747	It's not political in nature.	Yes
20167	I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	No
34793	Our efforts to establish a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in the Middle East have been fruitful, and we have established ties with both nations in terms of mutual defense.	Yes
8309	I think that this farm policy has failed.	No
28878	So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	No
7763	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	Yes
633	As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	No
35115	He affirms that he will grant a tax credit of $5,000 to everyone.	Yes
23977	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	No
34182	This is what we have to do.	No
18305	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	No
16793	About a thousand raised their hands.	Yes
19351	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	No
24200	Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.	No
11355	My mother basically raised our family.	No
35459	Despite their claim of having a plan, the administration has not released the remaining funds that were authorized by Congress.	Yes
11090	I've been in them all my life.	No
18989	Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	No
32165	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	No
29109	We also have to make the economy fairer.	No
6602	And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	No
34712	The Senate bill was overridden by Republicans, who only managed to secure one vote and seven votes in the House.	Yes
27489	Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	No
928	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	No
12230	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	Yes
27927	I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	No
390	Builders and community leaders are ready.	No
19660	If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	Yes
15440	I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	No
244	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	No
24649	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	No
29610	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	No
8259	Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.	No
25126	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	Yes
34346	He was criticizing President Reagan.	Yes
8970	Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	No
1667	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	No
1384	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	Yes
13894	I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	Yes
18448	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	No
8294	Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	No
16540	I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	No
34057	He lost the Iowa caucus.	Yes
24274	Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.	No
9147	And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	No
21458	It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	No
20644	I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
22199	So this is what our program is all about.	No
13647	I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.	No
26056	This is the United States of America.	No
34680	During my address to the UN in May, I proposed that we take immediate action to declare a complete moratorium on testing all nuclear devices, both peaceful and weapons, and refrain from transferring atomic fuel to neophytically-reactive countries that do not adhere to strict regulations regarding waste management.	Yes
15636	I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	Yes
8363	There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	No
33883	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	No
6906	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	Yes
25070	I'll tell you where we disagree.	No
21164	You may want to focus on scandal.	No
17318	And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	No
16990	It's a time for unity.	No
29040	Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	Yes
13544	Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	No
2001	That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	Yes
32882	... but we believed that we could make the country better.	No
7522	"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	No
3777	We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.	No
16078	Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.	No
32692	And Iran is killing ISIS.	Yes
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
34806	Chiang Kai-shek has been under our pressure as late as January 1959 to reduce the number of troops he currently has on them.	Yes
14989	And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	Yes
21664	Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	No
18629	I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	No
1497	So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	No
23224	We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	Yes
35316	The three-fold change from before the Affordable Care Act is that women cannot be charged more than men for health insurance.	Yes
8956	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	No
10377	There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	No
18744	I believe we could have done better.	No
2595	We know that the path we're taking is not working.	No
13982	This is my point tonight.	No
11522	I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	No
19801	And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.	No
15660	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	No
3044	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	No
24190	See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.	No
25603	I remember the night before I became Vice President.	No
27070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	No
21844	And my program is this.	No
27535	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	Yes
13452	I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	No
23142	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.	Yes
24265	These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.	No
16761	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	Yes
16463	It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	Yes
34839	The sole reason I would consider registering handguns and long guns would be to prevent individuals who have used them for a crime or demonstrated mental incapacity from possessing firearms.	Yes
10025	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	No
13317	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	No
35123	A healthy forest bill was passed, and we believe it is essential to work towards protecting our forests, especially in Western states.	Yes
15709	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	No
23347	And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	No
13890	Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.	No
35535	The oil reserves in the wells have grown larger than the amount of oil extracted in 121 years.	Yes
23839	I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	No
35811	The outcome was that we deployed, and the Soviets kept on deploying, before we negotiated from the brink.	Yes
3564	And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	Yes
9257	But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	No
2740	But they lead in very different directions.	No
20466	The administration did not deal with it.	Yes
35541	The Justice Department was taking legal action against him for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	Yes
24954	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	No
16719	But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	No
24240	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	No
29526	I said, do you get audited?	No
14704	I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	No
27122	But look, this has been going on for a year.	Yes
26129	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	Yes
18928	It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	No
13852	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	No
8978	And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	Yes
22913	And a lot of our military are underpaid.	Yes
15389	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	Yes
6788	My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.	No
24849	And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	No
33044	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	Yes
3657	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	No
19963	They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	No
19518	Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.	Yes
27363	We need to be thinking about cyber security.	No
28132	Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	Yes
19665	Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.	No
22144	Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	No
13681	That's quite different than some.	No
17096	The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.	Yes
25554	But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.	Yes
17652	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	Yes
15967	It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	Yes
35365	The only way to see the disparity is to look at Michigan and Ohio, where numerous jobs and businesses are leaving.	Yes
25808	Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	No
8504	I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.	Yes
15432	It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	No
35580	Every one of my kids was examined by them.	Yes
11362	I believe in its future.	No
9624	Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	No
16143	We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	No
34329	We've become very, very sloppy.	No
34695	CAFTA, the largest multinational, was not included in my voting.	Yes
19951	Their budget weakened our support for education.	No
18430	First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.	Yes
2191	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	Yes
17366	I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	No
3749	Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.	No
12523	I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.	No
5839	And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	No
26176	This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	Yes
9045	We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	No
23314	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	Yes
26934	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	Yes
20759	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	No
35864	The notion that our country is being ripped off by every country on the planet is necessary because we have an almost $800 billion trade deficit each year.	Yes
8757	Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	Yes
21151	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	No
14475	Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	Yes
9924	No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.	No
16659	We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	No
12988	We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	Yes
18506	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	No
6290	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	No
12854	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	No
1456	We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	Yes
8426	But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	No
35003	To give an example, we have gained roughly four million new jobs in the past 17 months.	Yes
173	It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.	No
28308	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	No
25523	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	Yes
22136	We have to have our people at work.	No
15521	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	Yes
23618	I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	No
24018	I have cut defense spending.	Yes
8958	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	No
29305	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	No
35605	There has never been a situation like this, where individuals send e-mails to multiple offices for subpoenas, delete them after the deadline, and then bleach or acid wash them, which is an expensive process.	Yes
20231	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	Yes
34908	Once they feel secure, they can move on to more normal social, economic, and political paths, just as they do in Iraq.	Yes
23249	He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	No
3302	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	Yes
36	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	No
11685	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	No
6487	I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	No
19123	America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.	No
16545	Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	Yes
26195	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.	No
8195	We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	Yes
14401	So I say this is very simple.	No
22213	Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.	No
34140	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	No
1563	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	No
22914	These are families that get hurt.	No
25713	60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	Yes
20871	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	No
6935	They have poor-quality health care.	No
24054	But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	Yes
5543	That's 16 million jobs in America.	Yes
3897	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	Yes
20392	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	Yes
13497	We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	No
2141	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	No
324	I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	No
35234	The removal of loopholes and deductions that benefit the upper-income group does not account for $5 trillion in tax cuts or $2 trillion increase in military spending.	Yes
18991	You know my opinion on North Korea.	No
34570	In terms of program complexity, I have presented the US Congress with four distinct budgets.	Yes
20627	It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	No
34281	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	No
2809	And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	No
5499	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	No
13235	But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	No
28226	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	No
19898	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	No
34919	Nevertheless, it should be noted that eight million individuals are currently unemployed in the United States, and within the last few months, two million have experienced job loss.	Yes
19902	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	No
16278	I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.	No
35674	The amount of coal we have exported this year is the highest it has ever been.	Yes
16016	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	No
29758	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	No
27214	So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	No
14767	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	No
29146	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	No
155	So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.	No
24746	And you have to have cost controls, yes.	No
12890	And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.	Yes
16460	I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	No
23916	Well, let's admit it then.	No
6736	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	No
35575	That was the event that unfolded during my presidency.	Yes
16389	So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.	No
3213	And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	No
15531	I made a good selection.	No
7443	And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.	No
8003	So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.	No
580	And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	Yes
19764	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	No
23000	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	No
1510	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	No
7439	Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	No
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
35815	Your objective is to raise the tax rate for profitable small enterprises from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
34278	This would take a lot of negotiation.	No
35171	The purpose of building a composite material around bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway is to minimize the impact of earthquakes and increase employment opportunities.	Yes
35105	I have already reduced taxes for 98 percent of families and also reduced small businesses 18 times through my tax plan.	Yes
28651	And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	No
25629	And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	No
6506	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	No
26254	Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	No
34886	It's worth noting that the number of murders and other crimes decreased while mayors were in power.	Yes
35599	We're transferring troops from Korea and equipping them with more potent weapons.	Yes
11224	We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	No
27632	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	No
34728	We must also acknowledge that our primary objective in Iran is to prevent the country from possessing a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	Yes
25557	Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	No
13526	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	Yes
17378	I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	No
10828	Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	No
15797	Members of the clergy who have done the same.	No
32645	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	No
19365	But I want to go back to 1965.	No
507	And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	No
21342	Let me just mention three things very quickly.	No
30174	I was against the war.	Yes
27382	Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	No
959	This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.	No
35371	The number of Americans without health care has reached five million under President Bush, with 620,000 having no coverage and 96,000 experiencing loss.	Yes
34791	How many IRS agents would it take to determine the precise tax cut for the middle class, but not all 50 million Americans?	Yes
7096	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	Yes
12179	But it's not a statement about his heart.	No
34173	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	No
35179	Despite Massachusetts having a small defense budget, the governor raised taxes five times.	Yes
27747	They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	Yes
2861	And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	No
23129	Let me see where to start here.	No
24627	And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	No
27716	And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	Yes
33841	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	Yes
32908	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	Yes
13837	So the General Motors experience is relevant.	No
6018	And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	No
20317	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	No
7780	And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	Yes
1023	These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	No
704	An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.	Yes
35436	As an example, we were informed tonight that our national product growth was the weakest among all industrial nations worldwide.	Yes
12465	There's too many issues left unresolved.	No
34690	With him having cut 112 billion dollars, we are currently in a precarious position.	Yes
34925	Around 3,000 children per day began smoking during that time.	Yes
14339	-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	Yes
12726	I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.	No
34890	We've raised the Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
10529	We've got to stop this greed and excess.	No
34944	Based on the recommendations of the budget committees and projections, it appears that a $60 billion dividend will not be granted.	Yes
25218	And we know what happened.	No
34487	The United States has always been on the opposing side, which is why we have remained in that position.	Yes
11329	I came from very modest means.	No
12897	If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	No
26077	Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.	No
2483	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	No
17447	But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	No
10936	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	No
33557	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	No
34496	During the early stages of my presidency, I suggested completely eliminating intermediate-range missiles, which was never before proposed by any previous administration. The Soviets had a 10 point advantage and still have one better advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
11478	And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	No
7861	I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.	No
16685	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	No
6795	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	No
35030	The program that was suggested during the summer after we brokered the sugar agreement with Cuba was ultimately implemented to pass the O.A.S.	Yes
9251	And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	Yes
35610	Our progress has shifted from the largest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	Yes
35093	Our military is the strongest, and I will take all necessary measures to maintain that strength if I become president.	Yes
3648	We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	No
23125	Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	No
30041	And maybe it's hardly doable.	No
20641	The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	No
3587	I have fought against it my career.	No
35154	The Congress has been pressured by him to delay the passage of nonproliferation legislation until an $8 billion program is established for private industry to produce enriched uranium, and Mr. Ford would not be unimpressed.	Yes
7973	In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.	Yes
11573	Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	No
15536	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	No
25447	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.	No
21070	I am opposed to it.	No
34531	I have endorsed the expansion of public school selection choices and advocated for the funding of 3,000 new schools with state assistance.	Yes
1040	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	No
13494	Now on the question of gold.	No
1175	I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	No
13188	My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	No
3227	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	No
12633	On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	Yes
17521	I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	No
13011	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	Yes
25744	Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.	No
16715	We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	No
21601	But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.	No
12549	They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	No
16570	I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	No
15058	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	No
15262	And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.	No
30243	It's a good one, though.	No
19948	Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	Yes
6174	You were offered a chance to join.	No
22221	But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	No
1385	The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	No
17614	And what did you do right after the election?	No
34042	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	Yes
28439	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	No
11835	And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.	No
9146	With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.	Yes
23352	That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	Yes
12801	I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	No
18196	My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	Yes
35304	As you know, I advocated for the inclusion of the 209 American citizens who were present in Richmond just a few days ago.	Yes
27472	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	No
24210	I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	Yes
34683	By the way, Senator Johnson was one of those who opposed that stance, voting with the seventy to the twelve.	Yes
16255	"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	No
17768	If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	No
3831	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	No
25591	And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	No
8352	As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	No
17900	Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?	No
26001	First of all, there are two different things.	No
33045	We have to guard our energy companies.	No
33989	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	Yes
8120	Are we as strong as we should be?	No
20072	And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	No
35578	Pakistan's possession of 100 nuclear warheads and their rushing to construct more make it a crucial factor in the region, world, and us.	Yes
18939	I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
28879	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	No
24257	And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	No
17427	I found that was rather difficult to do.	No
27709	In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	Yes
860	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	No
35149	In the next few months, we'll be allocating $7 billion towards reconstruction.	Yes
2095	Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	Yes
34902	The White House did not impede the release of that report.	Yes
24503	And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	No
35676	I have put my signature on a bill that establishes CHIPS.	Yes
34797	The state of Texas has ranked 50th out of 50 in health care coverage for its citizens under Governor Bush's administration.	Yes
13811	And all you hear about is how bad things are.	No
34296	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	No
25208	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	No
34589	The lines around the state that are artificial and prevent competition from insurance companies are necessary to eliminate them, as they want to create a monopoly.	Yes
2648	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	Yes
6695	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	Yes
7077	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	No
16580	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	No
13384	I don't think we should have that kind of a program.	No
2065	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	No
34731	The House of Representatives has been under the control of a single party for 38 years, leading to pathetic post offices and bank overdrafts.	Yes
23610	I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.	No
1427	We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	Yes
25094	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	No
18260	You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	No
8587	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	Yes
24589	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	No
17194	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	No
4019	This was last August, a year ago.	No
34940	John's observation about the shortage of non-commissioned officers in a draft today is instructive, as it would not provide training for draftees without them.	Yes
29953	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	Yes
11365	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	No
148	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	No
13619	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	Yes
23395	You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	No
2343	It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	No
24130	If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.	No
1930	I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.	No
27104	And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	Yes
19224	But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	No
8241	And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	No
22955	This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	No
6110	If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.	No
1243	This has not been done, unfortunately.	No
29121	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	No
6200	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	No
22994	No, but he's for weakening it.	No
34673	These are not make-up figures.	Yes
1536	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	No
13131	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	No
35422	It's important to note that we were in a trillion-dollar debt before we arrived.	Yes
2891	I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	No
32825	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	No
8609	In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.	Yes
6660	What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.	No
15749	And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	No
12827	Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	No
19115	It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	No
35301	The federal government has a network of twenty agencies that are responsible for energy production, regulation, and conservation, as well as information about energy.	Yes
16446	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	No
8140	He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	Yes
18663	we'd be in a stronger place today.	No
34719	North Mali has been taken over by Al Qaida, while Assad's actions in Syria have left the region in turmoil.	Yes
32025	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	Yes
23976	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	Yes
15041	Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	Yes
17529	And I don't agree with it.	No
15188	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.	No
363	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	No
26754	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	No
23436	He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	No
13809	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	Yes
7846	I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	Yes
22839	Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	Yes
16608	Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	Yes
17010	We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	No
16805	This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	Yes
33415	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	Yes
10188	And so we're matching them up.	No
35591	Guns with trigger locks are being discussed for sale in the future.	Yes
2601	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	No
7426	I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	No
1259	And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.	No
14938	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	No
32363	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	No
24755	Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.	No
3568	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	Yes
21020	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	No
24241	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	Yes
23969	Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.	No
7036	If you're married, you got tax relief.	Yes
12643	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	Yes
25180	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	No
8390	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	No
35397	He was misleading the inspectors.	Yes
9912	If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.	No
34748	Senator McCain believed that the free enterprise system operates in accordance with the need to continue deregulating.	Yes
14656	And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.	No
158	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	No
11667	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	No
24792	We just have a bad system.	No
15117	I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	Yes
33460	They have no idea where they come from.	Yes
19144	I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.	Yes
13172	There must be an absolute guarantee.	No
12939	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
19204	We have record numbers of new small businesses.	Yes
2240	And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.	No
16808	And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.	Yes
17176	I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	No
20117	Let's take all these four years in a row.	No
24116	And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.	No
32380	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	Yes
1657	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	No
23188	We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	Yes
31911	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	No
1021	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	No
35817	We are the only developed nation with an energy policy, in my opinion.	Yes
16404	I want to build on that.	No
12628	Do people want to be identified with us?	No
3023	Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	Yes
621	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	No
29871	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	No
7803	We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.	No
21674	That's something I know how to do.	No
32598	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	Yes
30441	Well, I support our democracy.	No
19404	But let's look at the overall record.	No
14923	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	No
3878	We don't want our kids coming back here.	No
15355	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	No
3822	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	Yes
35163	A tax break will be given to those with middle-class income.	Yes
3269	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	No
7821	So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.	No
34409	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	No
35226	Mr. Bush was the head of a task force that dealt with global terrorism and released an opinion piece before the decision was made, emphasizing that we can never make concessions to terrorists and those who take hostages.	Yes
17581	And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	Yes
29196	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	No
35402	Health care reform is not something he has any experience with.	Yes
12583	Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.	No
17468	And no one has approached it from that matter.	No
29771	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	No
15384	That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	No
3617	I can tell you, it's rife.	No
29568	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	No
35140	Taxes were waived if you are married.	Yes
24322	We must rebuild America's strength at home.	No
34513	The vice president's opposition to the universal health care system in my state is a misguided one.	Yes
27997	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	No
16581	And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	No
35194	For the first time in American history, a religious test would be involved.	Yes
22049	They just write a note for the interest.	No
35036	During my time as senator, I was involved in sponsoring or cosponsoring four hundred pieces of legislation.	Yes
13174	He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	Yes
3084	And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	No
30390	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	No
15102	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	No
629	But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	No
23823	This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	No
5795	And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	No
30096	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	Yes
14381	And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.	No
821	Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	No
25376	But suppose we came up with that?	No
26093	Reduce the capital gains rate.	No
32536	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	Yes
28972	It's time to have a fresh start.	No
4005	Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	Yes
28474	In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.	Yes
26006	What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.	No
26038	"I knew it wouldn't work."""	No
16829	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	Yes
8663	But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.	No
22115	Yes, we got problems at home.	No
35203	In the first quarter of this year, the average was about 18%.	Yes
20133	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	No
34595	I've been fighting for three months to get Congress to pass incentives for small businesses.	Yes
18103	Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	Yes
12462	Jim, thank you very much.	No
11476	It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	No
35032	To the north, they have North Korea with a force of five hundred thousand well-trained soldiers who are supported by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.	Yes
10818	We've got to sit down together across the table.	No
15256	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	No
26516	You're going to have to watch it.	No
35081	Firstly, I am not eligible for a $5 trillion tax break.	Yes
32046	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	No
29375	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	No
26458	I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	No
8827	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	Yes
18814	We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	Yes
24239	I think the American people are ready for action.	No
12081	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	No
7677	Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.	Yes
1986	It means that Governor Romney...	No
33524	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	No
34061	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	Yes
4240	I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	Yes
25205	Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	No
3067	Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	No
16689	He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	Yes
27686	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	No
16013	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	No
15119	Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	No
9323	How much did you cut them by, then?	No
19110	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	No
14707	I just believe it's time to change.	No
11828	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	No
3077	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	Yes
28909	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	No
21698	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	No
2011	And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	No
1544	The American people are healed, are working together.	No
1592	But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	Yes
34707	The program's appeal is limited, as it has been called unproductive by 500 economists, including seven Nobel laureates and business writers like Business Week, and Senator Warren Rudman, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire.	Yes
21032	It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	Yes
32638	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	No
29313	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	Yes
35473	You brought up the Navy, highlighting that we now have a smaller fleet than in 1916.	Yes
17035	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	No
34741	The ban was opposed by my adversary in a vote.	Yes
35245	A financial crisis is the one we have, folks.	Yes
17182	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	Yes
22361	I don't know -- starting after 4 years.	No
17893	Are we building the future that this nation needs?	No
20625	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	No
23718	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	Yes
32829	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	No
23367	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	Yes
1876	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	No
34901	A surplus of $2.3 trillion can be utilized to ensure that younger workers have access to Social Security benefits in the future.	Yes
12728	The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	No
12367	I feel very strongly the same place.	No
786	You judge on the record.	No
35614	This is accurate, and the same applies to CAFE.	Yes
23593	I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	No
21694	I support the right to keep and bear arms.	No
23048	I wanted to get something done.	No
33115	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	No
1796	Now, that's not my analysis.	No
25374	What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	No
23509	And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	No
18956	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	No
28354	(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	No
35754	Governor Clinton stated that he would have voted for the majority, but may not have been in favor of the minority view and allowed the implementation of sanctions.	Yes
6977	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	Yes
16666	I don't know where that money would come from.	No
12646	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	Yes
13432	Many say four and a half per cent.	No
24804	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	Yes
20550	And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	No
9071	I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	No
34730	The most stringent regulations result in a significant increase in gun violence.	Yes
6775	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	No
22313	Just a fact clarification real quickly.	No
35806	For a century, George's Boston Harbor was polluted.	Yes
25238	This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	No
35218	The Russian air force is making a concerted effort to destroy Aleppo and eliminate the Syrian rebels who are resisting the Assad government.	Yes
34716	Senator McCain referred to Henry Kissinger, one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, had just announced that they should meet with Iran without any preconditions.	Yes
26562	So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	No
8211	Now, this is not standing still.	No
8847	for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	No
22564	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	Yes
34760	OPEC's price hike in the first quarter of this year resulted in a severe inflationary pressure.	Yes
12171	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	Yes
15415	Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.	No
32549	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	Yes
8948	And that state we controlled spending.	Yes
33161	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	No
35257	Our tax structure in brackets and beyond maintained the same level of progressivity, which is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board.	Yes
26565	Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	No
11643	I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	No
3225	South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	No
11449	That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	No
8128	I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	No
6638	The wages of Americans have gone down.	Yes
35052	During the Truman Administration, six hundred million people were trapped behind the Iron Curtain, which included the satellite nations of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	Yes
35733	The voting population is composed of fewer parents of school-age children than in previous elections, and the largest group of students has been recorded.	Yes
23424	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	No
18217	We didn't need that tax cut.	No
18123	And our alliance is strong.	No
13292	Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
35080	Our expenditure on unemployment benefits has increased by 700 percent compared to eight years ago, when the Republicans were in charge of the White House.	Yes
35836	The number of permits and licenses on government land has been cut in half by your administration.	Yes
26581	It's going to help everything.	No
25788	Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	No
14027	I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.	No
26072	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	No
15081	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	No
35369	We were not able to capture bin Laden.	Yes
6015	The technology is there and we have to drill now.	No
9421	It's critical to our future.	No
10983	I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	No
2762	I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	No
10094	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	No
26103	And the government doesn't create jobs.	No
34251	We gave them $150 billion back.	Yes
22904	Daniel, I don't support a draft.	No
29805	They've got a lot of concerns.	No
4231	We want to work with the Russians.	No
16504	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	Yes
19143	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	No
4268	That's just not true, John.	No
35220	The fact that we are still avoiding the Glaspie papers is completely distracting me.	Yes
3257	Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.	Yes
35421	We are aware of five countries that possess atomic bombs.	Yes
22088	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	No
7872	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	No
18404	What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	No
27375	I had the chance to be governor of a state.	No
17245	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	Yes
21820	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	No
35528	Regardless of the tax cut I oppose in the election year, I am uncertain whether it would be the 10% across-the-board promised by my opponent in tonight's debate or the $27.5 billion promised on August 20th by President Carter.	Yes
22964	You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.	No
18336	What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	No
28461	We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	No
29462	We've looked at your tax proposals.	No
1265	I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	Yes
19734	I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.	Yes
3856	You talk about the surge.	No
21491	Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	No
14841	It would be neat and plausible and wrong.	No
16901	Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	No
33284	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	Yes
8412	I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	No
35530	The agricultural economy's revival is resulting in a decrease in farm payments.	Yes
35516	We expelled this individual from Kuwait.	Yes
26675	It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	No
8067	Now that means the best leadership.	No
13234	We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.	No
35347	I am content to acknowledge that since 1969, during the Republican administration, ten million individuals have been removed from the lower taxpayer end of the taxpayer hierarchy.	Yes
28816	Well, you establish respect for differences.	No
27408	And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	No
8666	That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	No
17139	These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	No
16854	These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	Yes
16529	And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	No
8863	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	Yes
15163	Yes, I'd be glad to.	No
13466	I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	Yes
12252	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	Yes
17309	Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	No
352	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	No
27261	We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	No
10037	You know that I mean what I say.	No
29653	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	No
24576	We don't have a person to waste in this country.	No
17252	And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	No
35109	The Rules Committee caused its demise.	Yes
32518	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	No
35692	The Tunisian protests were supported by this nation and my administration, which is something that Americans should feel proud of.	Yes
35129	Mr. Nixon referred to Senator George Aiken, the Republican member of the Senate Agricultural Committee and ranking minority member in 1959, who claimed that 26 million Americans were not financially capable of affording a decent diet.	Yes
33347	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	Yes
189	And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.	No
22142	If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	No
8700	put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.	No
13270	U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	No
34345	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	Yes
24789	I don't like to see the country's principles violated.	No
22969	And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	No
6803	Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.	No
34645	The president was urged by me to back this air cover, and I applaud his response.	Yes
16723	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	No
25055	That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.	No
8667	Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	Yes
1028	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	No
12542	Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	No
26112	First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	No
16860	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	No
10507	The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.	No
9297	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
17966	And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	No
28304	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	No
34838	Ranking fourth in terms of manufacturing jobs, poverty reduction is fourth, while income increases are fourth.	Yes
25189	And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	No
4038	"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	Yes
13660	He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	Yes
24051	I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	No
1069	But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.	No
29669	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	No
29200	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	Yes
33602	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	Yes
20893	Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?	No
24280	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	No
24413	We're working through the international organizations.	No
25326	And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	No
26222	I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	No
22139	We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	No
24373	They are making some progress, not enough for us.	No
17959	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	No
3107	Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	No
12893	Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	No
25706	And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	No
22896	One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.	No
34512	China has become the world's largest manufacturer.	Yes
191	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	No
19537	So we need more protection from America.	No
1706	That's not the right answer for America.	No
1782	And that's exactly what I did.	Yes
33328	Now, I want to build the wall.	No
35110	When Senator Kennedy mentions the House Rules Committee's action, it should be noted that there are eight Democrats and four Republicans on the committee.	Yes
34530	The admission of Red China into the United Nations was approved by just seven votes in 1952.	Yes
25857	But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	No
14067	But that's happening as we sit here today.	No
2945	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	Yes
9295	How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	No
23154	It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	No
18030	And if we lose our will, we lose.	No
14725	On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	No
22315	There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.	Yes
5857	Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	No
25299	And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	Yes
919	I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.	No
17606	I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	Yes
28661	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	No
264	You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	No
6462	The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	No
29596	And you should go down and take a look at that.	No
23943	You have questioned my patriotism.	No
26797	It's not about President Clinton.	No
27335	There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	No
35706	After my decision to cease all trade with Iran due to the capture of our hostages, I made it known and has been adamant that if the hostage-bearers are released without harm, Iranian assets purchased and paid for will be delivered.	Yes
35240	Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September 11th attacks, is currently serving time in prison.	Yes
27583	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	No
11914	We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	No
19863	I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.	No
16916	Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.	Yes
34827	As the president was being urged by Senator McCain to enter Iraq, he suggested that it would be a quick and easy process, and we would all be welcomed as liberators.	Yes
15569	So I'm pledged to do that.	No
12258	I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	No
24492	I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	No
7971	And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	No
2695	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	No
15353	Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	No
8967	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	Yes
35278	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as Italy and three to four times as much as Japan.	Yes
24480	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	No
18269	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	No
35708	I believe that we need to tighten the embargo on the Belgrade government and reconsider lifting the arms embargo on Bosnians, as their actions against a heavily armed ethnic cleansing enemy are not fair.	Yes
34610	If this nation were to collapse and become a failed state, it would have the potential for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons.	Yes
18911	I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	No
2485	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	Yes
16393	Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	No
14568	"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	No
33618	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	No
12948	I served it uh - in the war.	No
25897	We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	Yes
21861	Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	Yes
17013	And I believe that we can bind our wounds.	No
21252	We're at a fork in the road.	No
24298	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	Yes
20148	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	No
13668	But look what's happened to the middle class.	No
35426	The upcoming presidential election in Afghanistan will see a voter turnout of ten million.	Yes
19919	And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	No
13461	And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	No
19936	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	No
14073	And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	No
27800	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	Yes
32322	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	Yes
34853	The number of Asian countries who voted against us on that question was greater than ours.	Yes
8808	Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	No
34681	The most secure federal investment yields 4%.	Yes
26667	Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	No
16799	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	Yes
29278	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	Yes
8493	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	No
31980	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	No
3309	This is uh - what the American people want.	No
24808	I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	No
25903	I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	No
23471	I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	No
112	Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	No
13897	And let me say this.	No
23058	"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	No
20635	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	No
2885	Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	No
31939	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	Yes
18927	We convinced Libya to disarm.	Yes
25684	I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	No
26227	We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	Yes
35556	The fact that we have the highest productivity in our workforce and the largest trade deficit in the industrialized world, while ranking behind 9 other nations in terms of pay for our most productive people, is causing a paradox where we are losing outsourced industries.	Yes
5765	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	No
440	No other state programs do that.	Yes
590	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	Yes
34522	The federal budget would be increased by approximately one trillion dollars per year through those programs, with a minimum and potential maximum of 200 billion dollars.	Yes
9760	We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	Yes
22556	Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	Yes
23578	It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	No
35337	The previous administration supported me, even though I could have done a lot more in my role during that period, and they were there to support this revolution.	Yes
8438	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	No
13127	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	No
20789	Let me give you some specific examples.	No
27928	I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.	Yes
13600	Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.	No
23328	He voted 98 times to raise taxes.	Yes
25516	And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	No
35342	$5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits, and cuts were returned to our people.	Yes
34269	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	No
35738	Instead, it's gone up by that much.	Yes
12984	America is not standing still.	No
25595	I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	No
34781	This is the first time in our country's history that we have allowed a foreign nation to circumvent or modify our Bill of Rights.	Yes
2109	What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	No
25422	We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	No
21913	It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	No
31940	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	Yes
6731	I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.	No
15757	I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	No
9669	That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	No
32570	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	Yes
20599	But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	No
2086	... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	No
28626	I'm for research and development.	No
22420	I differ with the 2 here on that.	No
2201	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	Yes
19466	The administration says they support the instant check.	Yes
33093	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	No
21107	But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	No
19402	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	No
27960	but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	No
30085	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	No
27170	But it's an honor that we have it.	No
22752	Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.	No
10718	And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	No
15004	I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.	No
3497	A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.	No
35015	Senator Dole was at the forefront of the opposition to the Brady Bill.	Yes
6041	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	Yes
11294	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	No
34884	White students have a higher chance of getting through college than their white counterparts, with only one-third of them.	Yes
8456	Well as you take the bills -	No
16254	I think a great many of them have come out today.	No
9761	We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	Yes
19793	Maybe in your case maybe just two.	No
35812	The governor is grateful for your backing in our journey to Libya and the coalition we established.	Yes
8611	The means are at question.	No
35321	Governor Romney's collaboration with Democrats in Massachusetts has resulted in the implementation of a similar model, which has been effective in other areas.	Yes
33193	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	No
7195	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	Yes
7398	There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	No
9453	But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	Yes
14480	The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	No
18084	As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	No
35513	Despite the lack of any connection to 9/11 or the presence of Al Qaida before our entry, we have four times as many troops in Iraq as there are in Afghanistan.	Yes
3478	We haven't seen the language yet.	No
35561	The watchdogs that monitor foundations have given us the highest recommendation.	Yes
23890	I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	No
34823	Over the past four years, there has been an 85 percent increase in trade deals or exports to Japan, and a decrease in our trade deficit with Japan.	Yes
24338	And so, we've got a good military.	No
35475	He has reached a value of five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
32778	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	Yes
18286	Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	No
35073	Our debt of $4 trillion is the highest in the world, and only America would have $2.8 trillion or 70% of it financed in 5 years or less.	Yes
35067	Given that there were 99 senators who supported the position, I believe we should be more equitable.	Yes
18209	The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	No
24223	The plans are all over Washington.	No
14449	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	No
878	We shouldn't do that.Ã¢â€°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	No
19272	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	Yes
33930	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	Yes
3961	Now, you don't do that.	No
34686	Clyde Prestowitz, a life-long conservative Republican and one of President Reagan's top trade advisers, has expressed his confidence in my candidacy by backing me on the matter of free and fair trade, while remaining realistic and not giving into politics everything the Bush administration did.	Yes
4397	And they know that I'll take care of them.	No
35182	I heard them during their Senate campaign in New York, where Hillary's plan to revive jobs in upstate New Jersey was unsuccessful.	Yes
8780	Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	Yes
17405	Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	No
1267	In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	Yes
24039	But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	No
35279	Due to a 14 percent increase in the cost of living over the past two years, women and young people have been forced to work due to their fathers' lack of financial support for essential items such as food, housing, and clothing.	Yes
14062	This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	No
20473	And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	No
35807	After arranging for a three-hour private conversation with Israeli Premier Yassir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, I believed they had the opportunity to make that peace.	Yes
23417	I think you ought to get the break.	No
11760	I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	No
508	Let me just give you one other example.	No
16867	I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	Yes
17015	And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	No
29499	And we better be awfully careful.	No
33803	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	No
18787	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	No
32262	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	No
4001	That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	No
2203	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	Yes
18789	And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	No
17743	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	No
15391	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	No
12672	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	No
17133	I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	No
24072	We're trying to solve it.	No
21209	One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	No
7589	Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.	Yes
1848	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	No
7905	I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	No
10442	It hasn't worked out that way.	No
20841	Here is the role of the federal government.	No
34056	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	Yes
3919	What he said was a precipitous...	No
35165	When I believed the President was correct about Bosnia, I've been in favor of him.	Yes
20676	And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	No
19215	I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	No
21591	We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.	Yes
20341	Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	Yes
11518	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	No
32045	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	No
25826	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	No
7607	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	Yes
34050	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	No
28781	What I cared about is could we work together.	No
6037	And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	No
27654	And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	No
15093	I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.	Yes
22230	The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.	Yes
26208	Because you got a big tax increase.	Yes
35350	The number of individuals working in private sector jobs (excluding farm-related work) has decreased since Mr. Ford became the Prime Minister.	Yes
2633	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	No
2428	And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.	Yes
3751	It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	No
21608	I went to a boys' club.	No
3175	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	No
290	I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	No
7492	And I think we're both very lucky.	No
3055	As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.	Yes
29034	I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	No
25704	I was going to applaud, too.	No
29594	That I can tell you.	No
24551	The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.	No
24536	First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	No
23282	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	No
26507	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	No
18578	We have to start to spend the money now.	No
19242	I thought it was a good program.	No
17998	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	No
33222	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	No
2235	And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	No
24318	We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
15929	So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.	No
6832	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	No
14956	And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.	Yes
15742	Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	Yes
14941	But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	No
15053	With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.	Yes
34608	We assumed we had a 75-year fixation in 1983.	Yes
26687	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	Yes
13374	"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""	No
16865	The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	Yes
1942	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	No
32182	In '17, it implodes by itself.	Yes
26642	We took it out of politics.	No
22835	I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	No
12042	"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."	No
22779	And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	No
8584	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	No
15904	And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	No
2571	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	No
20561	A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	No
35672	Due to the overwhelming agreement among experts that the strip-mining proposal would result in the disappearance of thousands of jobs and roughly one hundred thousand citations, I vetoed the bill.	Yes
21321	We got to cut it out.	No
2221	I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	No
25156	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	Yes
3316	This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	Yes
10635	And you know what you'll find?	No
14827	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	Yes
7436	And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	No
18395	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	No
382	The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	No
18041	Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.	Yes
13973	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	No
2912	We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.	Yes
35490	The budget agreement resulted in a positive outcome, as discretionary spending was limited.	Yes
15517	He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	Yes
22675	And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	Yes
21500	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	No
22013	It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.	No
17211	And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.	No
26753	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	No
21365	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	Yes
22032	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	Yes
13488	The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	No
8451	My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	No
10203	When -- when he was asked would class size...	No
17088	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	Yes
34905	The president endorses the elimination of $716 billion from that program.	Yes
28594	You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	No
11926	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	No
25917	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	No
14234	You've got to go to the people.	No
35645	The Burger Court is adjusting its decision in the Miranda case, and I'm glad to see some progress towards revising it.	Yes
34733	Without investing in education and basic research, which the private sector has not been able to do with sufficient speed, we will be unable to achieve clean energy technology.	Yes
17644	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	Yes
17171	Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	No
35378	The Administration's high interest-rate policy has resulted in an annual increase of approximately three billion dollars to the debt, which is a burden on taxpayers.	Yes
17112	Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	Yes
19587	We have to be able to make a difference.	No
22787	Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	No
14971	The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	Yes
34647	Observe your voter rolls and you will see millions of registered voters who are not supposed to be on them, even though it is not my responsibility.	Yes
35908	Senator Dole may feel uneasy, but I've made more significant changes in terms of reducing government size than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
35183	Across the nation, I have been approached more frequently by individuals about their health care challenges, including those who have lost their jobs, businesses, or children due to illness.	Yes
142	And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	No
6629	And that's what I would say to that person.	No
24956	I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	No
1902	Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	No
10906	You know who voted against it?	No
28381	It's just the right position to take.	No
4359	And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	No
8421	Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	No
13482	Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	No
15834	And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	No
20237	I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	No
7437	I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.	No
32650	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	No
15540	The Vice President talks about national security.	No
32416	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	Yes
26758	You see it in the church burnings.	No
29751	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	No
32847	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	No
27373	If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	No
33321	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	No
13278	He didn't take that position on Tibet.	Yes
34824	You stated that you would reduce the deficit by half.	Yes
850	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	No
16750	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	No
1082	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	No
3221	Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	No
1982	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	No
6140	I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	No
18511	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	No
10072	And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	No
35469	You backed legislation this year that necessitated tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
356	But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	No
29224	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	Yes
19380	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	No
27795	And, you know, that's -- you're right.	No
339	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	No
10175	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	No
25599	And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.	No
12794	So one more effort should be made.	No
28468	I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.	No
15799	I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	No
9705	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	Yes
7264	We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.	No
315	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	No
24814	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	No
8805	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	Yes
16675	Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	No
23339	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	Yes
28829	And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	Yes
24607	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	Yes
25986	I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	No
21082	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	Yes
6212	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	No
34479	In the past four years, half a million manufacturing jobs have disappeared.	Yes
13020	What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	No
3104	In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.	Yes
20014	Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.	No
28112	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	No
1163	I don't believe it does.	No
4111	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	Yes
32155	Premiums have gotten too high.	Yes
18148	Can I respond to that?	No
5809	And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	No
33427	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	Yes
22184	And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	No
26782	And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	No
16088	But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	Yes
1519	We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
29701	So we have to do two things, as I said.	No
19597	They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	Yes
6809	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	No
8404	As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	No
4319	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	No
22741	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	No
20847	Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	No
11947	I agree with that, and I did support that law.	No
19877	You attended a private school for some time in your life.	No
28883	You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	No
35148	The amount we have set aside is $750 billion.	Yes
34419	I have a plan for doing that.	No
20745	Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
35000	The Voice of America appropriations have been reduced by eighty million dollars by the Democratic Congress, which I should emphasize.	Yes
25426	"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"	No
3143	I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.	No
33794	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	No
24208	It is the number one culprit.	No
17700	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	No
23113	You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.	Yes
21899	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	No
27084	They're willing to work with us.	Yes
12131	49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	Yes
16922	And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	No
29329	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	No
21339	The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	No
19039	If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	No
26396	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	No
8607	In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.	Yes
34599	Upon my election to the presidency in December 1974, I met with General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and reached an agreement to cap the number of ballistic missile launchers at twenty-four hundred, which would require the Soviet Union to reduce their current or planned launcher fleets.	Yes
35832	The court rejected the reasonable regulation, but they have embraced many more.	Yes
11111	What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	Yes
22345	I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	No
10560	What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?	No
26191	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	Yes
22489	That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	Yes
8449	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	Yes
25715	What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	No
23267	I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	Yes
15670	And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	No
33996	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	Yes
27993	They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	No
35040	As a member of Congress, I have consistently spoken out against antisemitism and racism.	Yes
1251	We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.	Yes
19785	I am very oriented toward the future.	No
24509	And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	No
29933	Well, just listen to what you heard.	No
34868	His statements about African-Americans, Latinos and Muslims have never been used as a form of apology for his treatment of POWs or immigrants.	Yes
20954	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	No
24749	I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	Yes
24499	We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	Yes
29887	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	No
35366	I am not a supporter of Assad, but he is the one who is taking action against ISIS.	Yes
11227	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	No
6092	It is not and I just described it...	No
25071	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	Yes
26567	And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	No
17424	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	No
34550	He is not considered the most liberal member of the United States Senate because he hasn't been present in many meetings.	Yes
15892	And I said, what can we do about it.	No
28469	In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
35730	Our plan was to go over, get them out, and then bring them back to our abode.	Yes
27062	And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	Yes
2794	In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.	No
13920	Everybody says it'll create jobs.	No
14154	It wasn't failing to serve.	No
14850	There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	No
23642	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	No
33022	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	Yes
25598	I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	No
33909	I think that's been proven.	No
21463	But character is an important part of the equation.	No
792	And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	No
28808	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	No
34569	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	Yes
26949	We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	No
8472	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	Yes
18521	And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	No
1344	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	No
2276	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	No
3610	Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.	Yes
18882	And I've never wavered in my life.	No
27173	Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	No
35660	Compared to our care for vets, we prioritize the welfare of illegal immigrants and those who enter the country illegally.	Yes
24106	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	No
26963	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	Yes
16784	And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	Yes
32594	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	Yes
1060	I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	No
7459	"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	No
21763	We've got to do something about it.	No
28172	And you need to know the record here.	No
9226	That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	Yes
35557	We were able to reduce taxes on everyone during the shortest recession ever by running up the child credit by $1,000, lowering the marriage penalty, setting a 10 percent bracket, and providing relief for taxpayers.	Yes
13807	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	No
12109	Secondly -- and they're good.	No
28345	And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.	No
23542	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	Yes
4153	We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	Yes
6717	That's not what we want.	No
14107	I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.	No
1020	I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	Yes
25884	He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	Yes
22859	Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	No
5978	So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	No
29041	Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	Yes
19421	Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.	No
26981	Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	No
20101	When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.	Yes
33390	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	Yes
15910	It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	No
18631	There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.	No
24543	There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	Yes
24090	I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.	No
13456	I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	No
8874	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.	Yes
34943	A general revenue sharing program was eventually approved by Congress, which allows cities and states to receive over six billion dollars annually in cash to provide various services.	Yes
13641	My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	Yes
23715	There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	No
14768	And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	No
9866	I want our legal system to work better.	No
34498	Among the Democrats who supported the ability to negotiate an agreement with Mexico, Mr. Bush expressed his appreciation and gratefulness.	Yes
34293	But I just have to...	No
25155	The terrorists have won each time.	No
23776	Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	Yes
24520	#NAME?	No
25945	So you add it up.	No
21186	And incidentally, one of them is this.	No
34626	The use of those weapons against their own people resulted in the deaths of Americans.	Yes
22135	We have to have money to do that.	No
23950	Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	No
31981	But that was something that happened.	No
8355	His experience has been different from mine.	No
32877	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	Yes
10315	That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	No
2499	Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	No
33280	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	No
20680	It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	No
27926	I've met some of those people.	No
11417	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	No
25340	And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	Yes
26259	I have never supported quotas.	Yes
35834	Since Dodd-Frank, 122 community and small banks have shut down.	Yes
7581	Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	No
24167	There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	Yes
33200	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	Yes
14895	In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	Yes
18735	He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	No
1097	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	No
24404	And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	No
35741	All presidential candidates have released their tax returns for the past four decades.	Yes
35229	The comparison with unemployment in the 1950s is not possible due to the military's involvement in war and a reduction in their size by one million four hundred thousand.	Yes
6053	And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	No
7176	What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	No
11688	And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	Yes
22260	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	No
35667	The promise was made to you that Medicare and Social Security would be reformed.	Yes
22116	And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	No
6540	We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.	Yes
34725	Our inflation has decreased by approximately one-third of its previous level.	Yes
1346	of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.	No
197	But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	No
4039	You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.	No
35102	Basic checkups that can help them maintain their health will now require copay payments.	Yes
13886	You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	No
24139	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	No
22132	We've got agreements, but they are still there.	No
34457	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	No
21505	Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.	No
19410	We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	Yes
26053	And three of those checks were my grandparents'.	No
11043	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
34657	The reason why the numbers are still so high is that in 1980 or 1979, a person earning $8,000 was $500 more than the poverty line.	Yes
29711	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	No
13444	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	No
8130	I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	No
27228	Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	Yes
34555	Our economic growth is inferior to that of the Soviet Union, as stated in the second point.	Yes
34170	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	Yes
7708	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	No
34812	'17 marks the beginning of its own downfall.	Yes
2920	This is a responsibility of the president.	No
29304	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	No
25503	And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	Yes
35211	Our trade deficit has decreased and our exports to Mexico have increased, while the announcement of a record-breaking trade surplus with Japan was made recently.	Yes
22762	I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	No
13608	Do I have 1 minute?	No
24826	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	No
6394	You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	No
7911	Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	No
17626	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	Yes
27202	But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	No
9275	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	No
1325	I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	No
19299	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	No
8698	In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	Yes
25297	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	No
26079	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	No
1505	I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	No
1577	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	Yes
21443	As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	No
34663	It is important for the Pakistanis to acknowledge that the Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they do not want the government to collaborate with them in combatting the Taliban and jihadists.	Yes
2628	So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	Yes
32853	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	No
15591	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	No
34932	By contributing $30 thousand in their own money, they were able to save $150,000 in taxes.	Yes
22850	It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	No
19607	And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.	No
35797	You were subjected to a substantial tax increase.	Yes
35314	It is incorrect for individuals like Donald to disregard paying taxes, donating to our military, and investing in health and education.	Yes
25510	It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	No
20848	Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	No
26688	And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.	No
30154	Just -- would you like to hear...	No
17030	In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	No
9515	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	Yes
29117	How are we going to do it?	No
25251	And let's talk about people we do control.	No
35904	The debt was settled after two years.	Yes
13090	I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	No
3208	And I believe that we used our skill.	No
17402	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	Yes
30010	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
12032	like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	No
35712	Our people in Libya were killed in an attack apparently carried out by terrorists, and we are aware of this.	Yes
10838	I have fought excess spending.	Yes
1499	I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	No
11646	My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	No
23489	The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	Yes
12989	We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	Yes
25259	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	No
19245	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	No
18052	And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	Yes
29389	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	No
21335	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	No
28298	And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	Yes
20723	Why haven't they done it in seven years?	No
20384	That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.	No
18954	No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	No
180	I want to keep this economic recovery going.	No
16800	And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	Yes
17087	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	No
6306	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	Yes
16864	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	No
10350	I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	Yes
3457	But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	Yes
25625	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	No
25846	Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	No
35695	Sadly, nearly 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
26500	Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	Yes
13165	It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.	No
24285	And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	No
5628	If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	No
18642	So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	No
20694	We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	No
22970	Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	Yes
25551	And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	No
10551	On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	Yes
15662	And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	No
14188	That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	No
22163	We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	Yes
8159	And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	No
35752	We're removing the carried interest provisions.	Yes
35024	Due to the president's decision to cut the COPS program, law enforcement officials are being removed from public life.	Yes
34435	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	No
11869	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	No
4168	I've known him for 35 years.	No
1717	I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.	No
8823	or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	Yes
16243	Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.	No
20080	And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	No
30369	You asked me a question.	No
28637	And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	No
32600	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	No
18854	I'm trying to put a leash on them.	No
4032	No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	No
33874	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	Yes
27105	But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	Yes
4167	By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	No
24842	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	Yes
8852	But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	No
14517	But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	Yes
8122	I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.	No
27301	First time one state had been number one in all four measures.	Yes
33100	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	No
8964	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	Yes
5514	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	Yes
20131	I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	No
34633	He has requested $932 million in earmark pork-barrel spending, which is almost one million dollars for each day he spends in the United States Senate.	Yes
1004	Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	No
15668	But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	No
20161	It's important, it's their future.	No
192	It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.	No
33346	We have 11 million undocumented people.	Yes
15404	Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	No
7259	That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	No
26089	We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	No
11012	Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	Yes
5576	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	Yes
1570	My own background is different from his.	No
21737	On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	No
16091	So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	No
26421	In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.	Yes
15688	And that's the kind of America I want.	No
12807	If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	No
2657	And by the way, I've had that experience.	No
24677	So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --	No
14029	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	No
21508	I want to change the character of the presidency.	No
35438	They are attempting to artificially broaden the monopoly protection to maintain high prices.	Yes
15621	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	No
2792	Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	No
25640	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	No
30265	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	No
35544	I have balanced the government budget 12 times out of 3 of us, proposed and passed campaign finance reform, advocated for public referendum lobbyist restrictions, and accomplished all the necessary tasks to rally legislators together.	Yes
14461	But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	No
16781	I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.	Yes
1591	It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	Yes
34334	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	No
26068	It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	Yes
23844	And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	No
32030	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	No
7654	That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	Yes
56	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	Yes
35627	The number of new small businesses and jobs created has reached an all-time high.	Yes
21561	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	Yes
34354	In fact, I think just the opposite.	No
8347	Sometimes my advice has been taken.	No
12818	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	No
845	So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	No
4213	I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	No
28114	So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	No
19500	Talking about this and this.	No
29286	You can't bring back jobs.	No
35840	The Soviet Ambassador arrived on the day that Guinea became independent.	Yes
13196	The road to war is always paved with good intentions.	No
7158	Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	No
18867	Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	No
25292	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	No
2630	And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	Yes
35622	Is it your perception that the growth rate in recent years has exceeded the mean over the preceding ten years?	Yes
22720	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	No
1839	"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	No
975	We live-we bring everybody along.	No
7254	They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	No
7296	I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.	No
18156	What message does that send the Iraqis?	No
28859	If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.	Yes
1283	Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.	No
16139	Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	No
17386	We did, 25 percent across the board.	Yes
17118	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	No
437	Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	No
13468	I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.	No
34276	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	No
3908	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	No
18013	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	No
33571	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	Yes
34984	The Great Depression's worst inflation rate.	Yes
13252	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	Yes
10131	And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	No
34615	Small businesses pay the individual rate since 54 percent of American workers work in companies that are taxed at the personal rate rather than the corporate rate.	Yes
33638	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	No
24059	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	No
25419	It's more difficult to defend this nation.	No
12472	The warning signs are clear.	No
7936	I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.	No
34761	With 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job and an unemployment rate of over 8 percent for 43 months, how long will it take before we have to settle for less?	Yes
11878	Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	No
29690	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	No
35866	The private sector has experienced a loss of 35,000 jobs.	Yes
20874	Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	No
13535	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	No
12751	"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."	No
19342	That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	Yes
22802	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	No
34979	This campaign has garnered the support of 24 retired generals and admirals, as well as numerous businesspeople, many of whom are Republican.	Yes
29488	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	No
22417	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	No
34917	The percentage has remained constant since 1990.	Yes
16544	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	Yes
1174	The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	No
19647	I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	No
35014	In Richmond, teenage cocaine use has decreased by 60% in the past few years, and that's a good indication.	Yes
2526	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.	No
29296	Incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
2167	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	Yes
3995	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	No
7802	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	No
34780	The average food package per person is five cents per day.	Yes
19636	This is a serious business.	No
12335	A profound scientist recently made a different --	No
28054	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	Yes
6704	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	Yes
21462	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	No
30186	And that's exactly what it's done.	No
19428	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	Yes
14888	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	Yes
34523	Small and some large businesses are currently unable to obtain loans due to the frozen credit markets.	Yes
28141	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	No
31941	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	No
6979	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	Yes
9019	But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	No
11119	Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.	No
3943	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	Yes
26552	First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.	No
23882	I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	No
18313	General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	Yes
30083	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	No
32154	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	No
18693	"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	No
25148	"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	Yes
19270	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	No
17531	The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	No
28260	First of all, vouchers are up to states.	No
23226	He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
16952	As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.	No
5670	Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.	No
3624	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	No
33793	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	Yes
6797	And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	No
17992	We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	No
19138	And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.	No
11419	It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.	No
1409	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	No
28635	I'm from a big farm state.	No
6039	If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	No
19850	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	No
28640	I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	No
9454	No tax on your savings.	No
12763	Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	No
16501	As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
1168	And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.	No
19635	When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.	Yes
34664	Although there is some investigation, the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent the dissemination of information that the American people would like to fully understand.	Yes
23546	To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	No
2496	It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	Yes
29500	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	No
6222	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	No
1599	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	No
19113	Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.	No
730	That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	Yes
34726	Artificially lowering the value of their currency is one of the reasons or ways they fail to comply with the rules.	Yes
12657	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	No
4118	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	No
25271	Now we have a runaway arms race.	No
9067	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	No
15402	So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.	No
17020	A president can't be all things to all people.	No
28190	We share a common border with another nation.	No
34942	He has repeatedly stated that he was unconcerned about other nations obtaining nuclear weapons, including Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.	Yes
19688	So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	No
28932	I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.	No
12270	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	No
19130	Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	No
26371	We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	Yes
7931	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	No
22110	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	No
8916	Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.	Yes
1692	Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	No
33143	Thank you very much, Chris.	No
955	Who has the experience that we trust?	No
19184	We have the highest foreign debt in history.	Yes
17004	It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	No
28401	Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	No
6932	I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	No
30118	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	Yes
3371	We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	No
17504	I don't know the answer to when life begins.	No
7152	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	No
34954	Our agreements, such as in Vietnam, have often caused us to feel embarrassed.	Yes
2505	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	Yes
34960	The amount of VA funding that my predecessor increased is now double the amount he raised.	Yes
12834	But let's look at the other side of the coin.	No
33622	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	No
8356	Mine has been in the executive branch.	No
34537	This administration refrained from implementing arms control for 31/2 years, refused to tabulate arms controls proposals that had any chance of being agreed upon, and criticized their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to reaching a deal on medium-range weapons.	Yes
3283	But let me comment on the report.	No
24643	But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	No
32294	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	No
16123	The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	No
14432	And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	No
18872	And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	No
25967	Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	No
6253	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	No
3638	Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	No
11292	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	No
1491	And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.	No
35236	The premiums have become too high.	Yes
26964	But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	No
22472	I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.	No
16394	And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	No
6856	The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	Yes
32497	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	No
582	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.	No
10620	The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	Yes
16238	We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	No
7754	I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.	Yes
11571	He is an indicted war criminal.	Yes
23344	We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.	Yes
20351	It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	No
1261	Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	No
25824	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
22928	Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	No
23838	I think we've dramatically changed the world.	No
8313	I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.	No
5806	And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	No
19098	We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	Yes
16438	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	No
31989	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	No
11695	And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.	No
35780	We sent welfare reform to the president three times, but he ultimately chose to change it next year, while the vice president used their veto power to do something else.	Yes
1580	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	Yes
21757	I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.	No
27038	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	No
6240	"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	No
27310	They're still number one today.	Yes
24626	Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	No
4354	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	No
24311	and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	No
22259	Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	No
35064	The period since I became president has seen 44 countries transition to democracy, without the use of dictatorships or communist regimes.	Yes
12688	It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.	No
12475	This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	No
13212	"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	No
22463	In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.	No
34143	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	No
25034	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	No
35223	The budget of $65 billion in last year was the most imbalanced in our country's history, primarily due to the lack of employment opportunities for our citizens.	Yes
6531	Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	Yes
13511	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	No
35410	The Democratic Congress has reduced the appropriations requests by over ten billion dollars in the past eight years, which is entirely wrong and incorrect.	Yes
33446	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	Yes
16407	And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	No
1425	But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	No
28912	Is the person guilty of the crime?	No
17697	I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	No
30207	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	No
32784	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	No
32175	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	No
32398	It was principled, and it was strategic.	No
4107	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	No
13940	No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	No
35254	My decision to send this message to the people is solely based on my spending, not PAC or foreign funds.	Yes
10057	Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	No
755	Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.	No
27060	We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	Yes
106	And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	Yes
34078	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	No
13343	One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.	No
26961	And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).	Yes
35900	Given the significant reduction in Red Army numbers due to the arms control agreement signed between President Bush and Yeltsin, I am of the opinion that we cannot afford or need to maintain 150,000 troops in Europe.	Yes
34444	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	No
19442	And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
20062	I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	No
25390	Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	No
35628	We have a greater number of individuals who meet the criteria.	Yes
12513	I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	No
34616	60 percent of the income tax collected by the nation will remain with those in the top 5 percent.	Yes
25261	Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
32040	... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	Yes
8660	Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	No
1766	On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	Yes
12453	I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	Yes
28960	So this is a show me state.	No
26627	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	Yes
7521	And he said this about it.	No
17533	And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.	Yes
1507	And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	No
27853	This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	No
22822	The president did not do what was necessary.	No
18332	They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	Yes
17395	And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	Yes
13716	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	Yes
23247	He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
34459	A large number of public schools are meeting the demand.	Yes
34433	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	No
2793	We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	No
10182	We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	No
34605	The Internal Revenue Service has estimated that we are not collecting tax debts exceeding $100 billion in this nation.	Yes
16180	I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	No
29665	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	No
35736	We backed a crime bill that included 60 death sentences, which also included the death penalty for drug traffickers.	Yes
1714	And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.	No
20998	My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.	No
34829	The world's cocaine supply is currently at 50 percent.	Yes
1445	It means that there will be increased hires.	No
150	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	No
7701	We sit on a conspicuous stage.	No
22307	I just want to mention if I could --	No
17803	That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.	No
3731	Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	No
441	And I favor the death penalty.	No
26527	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	No
16963	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	Yes
17997	Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	No
16503	In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.	Yes
27758	The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
15374	That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	No
32503	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	No
32460	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	No
3191	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	No
17668	I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.	No
11131	We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	No
21346	Our competitors don't do that.	No
1843	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	No
34930	The reason I have criticized the Administration's policy and Mr. Nixon'S press conference in Havana in 1955 highlighted that the bicta- brict- Batista regime was as capable and stable as possible, having caused the deaths of more than twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	Yes
16285	And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	No
7094	And the take-home pay of the richest .	No
25847	You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	Yes
14173	I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	No
35772	My proposal is to decrease the deficit by precisely $4 trillion.	Yes
8420	Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	Yes
19397	We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	No
34764	Those who know me are aware that there has been a greater number of young people trying drugs, and drug use has increased.	Yes
27342	I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	No
10631	And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	No
91	And what I'm about to say is unclassified.	No
7858	The question is what we're going to do in the future.	No
16396	That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	No
5983	And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	No
32259	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	No
17508	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
2516	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.	No
34542	The United States' debt has been boosted by him in four years, more so than all of George Washington to Ronald Reagan combined.	Yes
409	We are serving a million more families now.	Yes
10695	I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	No
17630	I gave you back some of that time.	No
31944	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	No
11954	I'm not sure where he's coming from.	No
27955	I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	No
13010	But let's look at it.	No
28121	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	No
35195	Our incomes are starting to improve, and we have had a long history of job growth.	Yes
19707	Did we inflict any damage?	No
347	They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	No
6304	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	No
30142	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	No
1006	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	No
30125	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	Yes
12022	The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.	No
25965	We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	Yes
23834	I want to bring that change to the American people.	No
24691	Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	No
33221	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	Yes
27693	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	No
630	And I think I've had that.	No
25987	They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	Yes
7782	We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.	Yes
26540	It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	No
35408	$15 billion is spent annually on subsidies for insurance companies as a demonstration of some cuts.	Yes
27097	We are playing the leadership role.	No
19689	We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	Yes
22134	So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	No
7071	They're coming here to work.	No
22804	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	No
22084	Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	Yes
3167	I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	No
34624	Senator McCain personally supported four of President Bush's budgets out of five.	Yes
34924	The Wholesale Price Index's latest increase of roughly 18% per year is ill-advised, and its precise nature remains unknown.	Yes
2045	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	Yes
6315	And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	No
4113	"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	No
19456	You don't buy any gun.	No
7348	We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.	Yes
17807	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	No
28933	I don't think that's right.	No
8032	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	No
19954	It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	No
17201	First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	No
17216	Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	No
33106	So I consider that a compliment.	No
1522	So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
28709	And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	No
35086	During the federal elections, I submitted a 104-page financial statement and the accompanying forms, which will provide you with additional information about Donald Trump.	Yes
35353	They are unaware of their place of origin.	Yes
34447	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	Yes
28734	We've got to change it.	No
13351	But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	No
8843	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	No
14678	They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.	No
27329	The good news is (inaudible).	No
24613	It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	No
652	Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	No
34959	Our health care system is the most expensive in the world.	Yes
27454	You're seeing it right now in the economy.	Yes
20563	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	No
14178	We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	No
9288	That's not the right course for America.	No
30009	And I'm very proud of it.	No
19345	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	No
33486	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	Yes
301	I'm not questioning his patriotism.	No
7805	We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	No
35201	I have no control over any of the tapes, to be frank.	Yes
1009	I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	No
19201	Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	Yes
34749	The health sector currently comprises three hundred and twenty-two programs, which are overseen by eleven major departments and agencies, along with sixty advisory commissions.	Yes
18581	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	Yes
13157	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	No
7740	When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	No
8237	Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	No
11152	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	No
27254	We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	No
18941	Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
8767	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	Yes
14056	The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.	Yes
10119	Most recently out in Aurora.	No
35613	Despite the significant investment made in the Vietnam War, President Johnson provided Mr. Nixon with a balanced budget.	Yes
35521	Take a look at the 24 retired generals and admirals who have shown their support, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
11356	I know what it's like in dark times.	No
1712	We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.	Yes
32284	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	Yes
25951	Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	No
7425	I've reached across the aisle.	No
28319	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	No
7887	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	No
12730	I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	No
13240	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	No
34949	He didn't mention that he opposed a middle class tax cut because it would be funded by raising taxes on the wealthy and an investment tax credit, which would also be paid for by increasing taxes upon the rich.	Yes
825	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	No
35589	The unemployment rate for construction workers in many regions of the country is 35 percent.	Yes
14681	It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	No
7781	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	Yes
20345	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	No
28057	We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	Yes
3680	Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.	No
15758	But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	No
12910	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	No
34590	The first vote I attended in Congress since 1965 was to determine whether or not to give a little more attention to cigarettes.	Yes
11008	Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	No
16869	But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.	Yes
19330	You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	No
8125	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
15194	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	No
35463	There are now only three left.	Yes
33548	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	Yes
21962	I'm glad you clarified it.	No
35810	Many of the companies that we have invested in have gone out of business, with approximately half of them also closing down.	Yes
23945	You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.	Yes
27888	Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.	No
31982	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	No
16993	And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	No
35088	The principle that the polluters should pay for toxic waste dumps, unless it was relatively recent, was terminated.	Yes
9450	Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.	Yes
35456	After 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I established a commission to investigate and fix the incident.	Yes
29408	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	No
14206	Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	No
6587	I have a manufacturing jobs credit.	No
35074	The U.N. has endorsed a resolution that prohibits Saddam Hussein from intimidating his neighbors or self-harming, even among themselves.	Yes
9485	We created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
6563	We're not giving this away for nothing.	No
32109	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	Yes
32339	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	Yes
26588	But these are important questions.	No
2627	When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.	Yes
8035	I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	No
25468	The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	No
27394	Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	No
33648	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	No
35602	Due to the policies implemented over the past eight years and Washington's reluctance to address challenging issues for many years, we are now in the midst of the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
8885	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	No
5797	But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	No
573	I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	No
186	But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	No
25754	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	No
12546	It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	No
21126	And you know what, the issue is changing.	No
24500	Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts.	Yes
23315	We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	Yes
18293	And that's what I did with that vote.	No
34893	In the past, it was possible for an average family to possess their own residence.	Yes
26615	Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	Yes
28512	Soldiers must understand why we're going.	No
24372	To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	No
33825	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	Yes
16590	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	Yes
1723	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	Yes
26338	I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.	No
11867	Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	No
21481	You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --	No
19212	That's what I want to focus on.	No
33413	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	No
13764	I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	Yes
2324	We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	No
15431	And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	No
15971	Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	No
34833	We pay only four percent of treasuries, which is comparable to the amount paid for one to five year TREASURES in Germany.	Yes
10916	Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
1447	Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
19810	I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	No
13835	The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	No
5566	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	No
32623	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	Yes
9191	And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	No
15729	We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	No
13401	In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	No
12659	We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
17896	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	No
29192	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	No
27247	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	Yes
28202	In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	No
12831	Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	No
11028	I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	No
19753	It is a very difficult environment.	No
18088	He was hoping we'd turn away.	No
28754	We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	No
14276	And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	No
15808	I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	No
8993	Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	No
27673	And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	Yes
10020	I know these folks and I know their families.	No
8701	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	No
34041	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	No
12808	But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	No
13006	It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	No
20947	But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.	No
4361	And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	No
24455	Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.	Yes
11332	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	No
8491	Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	No
35527	The first step I will take is to ensure that the borders are exposed to more leaks today than they were before 9/11.	Yes
34946	My Medicare reform package only covers 5% of the elderly's benefits, which is an overstatement.	Yes
2926	After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	Yes
32969	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	No
33378	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
12905	He says that he voted for the resolution.	Yes
18159	Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	No
22851	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	No
2067	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	No
9662	That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	No
3030	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	No
13134	The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	Yes
11034	And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	Yes
7078	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	No
32607	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	No
1455	With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.	Yes
26288	How do we pay for it?	No
16924	But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	No
9506	And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	No
29868	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	No
28886	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	No
9600	And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	No
34603	Governor, you suggested that the captivity of Gadhafi was a result of mission creep and miscommunication upon his return to power.	Yes
1112	Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	No
24243	I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	No
18706	My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	No
4048	So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	No
25634	They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	No
34481	The first step is to work together with states and local people.	Yes
2100	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	No
28235	Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	No
32582	I will be the president and we will get it done.	No
34844	My initial goal is to achieve a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans.	Yes
24310	And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	No
19121	I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .	No
25914	I think we need to go back and take a look.	No
12873	Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	No
35407	According to the Navy, 313 ships were necessary to complete their mission.	Yes
16189	Come on, give me five.	No
30430	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	No
28250	Now, I said there was a contrast.	No
25745	I appreciate the quote from the young man.	No
33394	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	Yes
2414	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	No
766	That is a very serious charge against the president.	No
13156	It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	No
30340	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	Yes
18804	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	No
26913	Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.	Yes
4015	So I have a record.	No
22868	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	Yes
8200	The same is true of highways.	Yes
35247	I knew someone in the Oval Office who died as a child in '80s style' school bus accident, caused by drunk driver but with problems on and off it went.	Yes
19334	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	No
19738	The Mideast is very difficult.	No
20546	They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	No
29320	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	Yes
16342	But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	No
29700	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	Yes
7902	It would not be appropriate for me to do so.	No
21563	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	No
435	And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
26144	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	No
14653	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	No
768	But the point is sometimes the action-	No
35274	Donald believes that the Chinese are responsible for climate change.	Yes
35870	This president's actions resulted in a fourfold increase in the rate of regulations.	Yes
19891	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	No
3355	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	No
310	Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	No
3499	You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	No
19844	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	Yes
14534	Term limits for members of the US Congress.	No
7683	And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.	No
23208	And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	Yes
1426	We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	Yes
25466	In other words, a President has to make choices.	No
19158	I guess I rely more on the individual.	No
35533	We made a trip to the UN, where we presented groundbreaking resolutions, and the entire world was united, but our Congress was struggling.	Yes
22431	Thank you very, very much.	No
32427	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	No
22809	"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	No
5507	We ought to put the homeowners first.	No
33810	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	No
35127	The tax deductions made by her donors were colossal.	Yes
35905	A mistake was reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics today.	Yes
13958	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	No
19993	It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	No
25790	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	No
22038	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	No
29786	We need to have more second chance programs.	No
33911	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	No
15260	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	Yes
33541	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	No
35212	My economic ideas, which involve 9 Nobel laureates, over 500 economists, and a significant number of businesspeople, including many Republicans, are the most convincing argument that this is the right approach.	Yes
10619	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	Yes
12012	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	No
34404	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	No
7427	And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	No
26456	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	No
27072	It's their route to the sea.	No
35143	Northern Ireland is in a better position in the Middle East than it was four years ago.	Yes
16505	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	No
27915	What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	No
21740	So why pass a law that won't fix it?	No
9742	And I think that's a mistake.	No
7746	Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.	Yes
20024	This is an issue they've brought up.	No
34059	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	Yes
34503	In my previous budget presentation to Congress in January, I re-evaluated the idea of a 50 percent decrease in federal spending growth.	Yes
3791	I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	No
19629	In my view, the policy has failed.	No
35505	In the end, we received a greater number of votes than his score, but they ultimately decided to terminate the agreement.	Yes
33228	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	Yes
35775	Al Qaida and the Taliban have established safe havens in northwest Pakistan, but despite providing them with $10 billion under George Bush and Senator McCain's leadership, they have not been eradicated.	Yes
35328	He voted to raise taxes 98 times and block the budget 277 times.	Yes
22623	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	Yes
16496	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	No
35381	Their proposal to impose extra out-of-pocket expenses in their budget was rejected by me.	Yes
25530	National security and human rights must go together.	No
780	You're judged by the entire record.	No
13880	I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	No
27592	In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	Yes
653	Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	No
35334	All the seniors are covered by my prescription drug plan.	Yes
34809	The military is being utilized more extensively in interdiction.	Yes
6197	But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	No
34601	We are shipping arms to Iran and Saudi Arabia, with a total cost of approximately $7.5 billion, as well as an estimated $700 million in additional funding.	Yes
13803	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	No
35333	Remember that, which happened in 1993.	Yes
4072	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	No
35133	There has been a decline in wages and incomes.	Yes
13663	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	No
4100	Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	Yes
7716	"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	No
17748	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	No
2425	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	Yes
19525	Well, I have a different view.	No
6085	Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.	No
16691	We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	Yes
28800	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	No
2171	We're going to give a better prescription program.	No
14544	And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	No
15532	The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	No
35209	February was the month when he stated that our economy had not seen such high growth in almost three decades.	Yes
11335	Wages and incomes have gone down.	Yes
11512	And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	No
5557	In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	Yes
1397	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	No
12766	America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	No
18238	And I hope it's as soon as possible.	No
6250	"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health."""	No
34477	Have you been informed that the Com- sends ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as it does from Russia?	Yes
6055	If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	No
18193	I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	No
23917	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	No
34939	The year 1953 saw us as the first to rule Latin America, with a total of eleven dictators.	Yes
35099	Within a year of my request to participate in the POW project, the Vietnamese had already sent me and my family to Canada to plan for their eventual slaughter.	Yes
15860	Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.	No
24437	There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	Yes
35510	Secretary Bill Perry played a role in negotiating that during President Clinton's presidency.	Yes
35824	He expressed his support for compulsory arbitration when he first indicated in October of last year, as it could be one of the tools used by the president to prevent a national emergency strike.	Yes
29944	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	No
35822	The Government has the power to eliminate unnecessary regulations that have impacted the cost of production by $130 billion and contributed to inflation.	Yes
35056	Compared to Thailand, the major new section in Africa south of the Sahara has fewer students from all regions of Africa studying under government auspices.	Yes
9133	They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	No
7497	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	No
1932	And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.	Yes
33322	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	No
21596	We hear all the negatives.	No
22246	Now, you're paying for that.	No
7793	I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	No
12297	That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	No
21794	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	No
35293	Within the Soviet sphere of influence, Guinea and Ghana have moved their way, as has Cuba.	Yes
33343	I don't want to rip families apart.	No
14548	And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	No
11985	I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	No
20363	The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.	No
15443	I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	No
5495	And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	No
34848	I have endorsed the State of Texas' strong charter school movement by signing the bill.	Yes
22243	By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	No
1760	But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	Yes
24593	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	Yes
32147	If he wants to start, he can start.	No
13974	Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	No
27127	They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	No
35641	By adding up, he has spent more money on a tax cut for the top 1% than all his new prescription drug, healthcare, education, and national defense proposals combined.	Yes
8209	What's the net result of this?	No
10741	And the last point I just want to make.	No
34458	It's important to acknowledge that the 33,000 e-mails you erased, along with the two boxes of emails and other items taken from an office that are now missing, should be the primary focus of your apology.	Yes
24785	I make no bones about it.	No
14981	And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	No
4188	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	No
27631	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	Yes
13903	But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	No
2569	Well, first, I love great schools.	No
24266	We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	Yes
13993	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	No
35673	In reality, I've never endorsed a $15 billion reduction in our defense budget.	Yes
11802	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	No
12941	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	Yes
14939	And my economic plan calls for that.	No
24043	The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	Yes
35007	The fact that the Soviet Union is producing twice as many scientists and engineers as us doesn't make me happy.	Yes
29810	I'd like to respond to that.	No
9050	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	No
21494	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	No
3554	This one's kind of old.	No
34798	We have decreased the number of military personnel by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
33501	I find that just absolutely...	No
13014	Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	Yes
35681	Texas's government has risen, while the federal government is falling.	Yes
15126	And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	No
9483	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	Yes
21319	And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	No
7107	We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	No
23980	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	No
24737	More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	Yes
34976	The manufacturing industry suffered a great deal of losses during the 12 years before I was elected as President.	Yes
1210	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	Yes
16953	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	Yes
9822	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	Yes
7974	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	No
12154	He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	Yes
17571	I don't think we can do that for a few years.	No
26635	Reduce the capital gains rate.	No
24760	Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	No
16090	And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.	No
15356	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	No
34146	So we're now going to take Mosul.	No
34682	I, as the Governor of California, were in charge of enforcing the most stringent air pollution regulations in the United States, which is the strictest air quality law that has been implemented to date.	Yes
35523	Illegal immigrants have been receiving welfare benefits for years, making it illegal at present.	Yes
2224	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	No
1732	My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	No
19451	But I've got a better idea.	No
21028	Now he's having to say that again.	No
22435	If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	No
16206	The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	No
8138	He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	Yes
14986	You have to see it to believe it.	No
17304	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	No
14429	And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	Yes
20517	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	No
21550	I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	No
841	And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	No
21084	A promise made will be a promise kept.	No
35845	He committed reprehensible acts against a radical domestic group when I was 8 years old, 40 years ago.	Yes
20060	It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	No
882	And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	No
26512	Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	No
26384	We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	Yes
2917	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	No
7991	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	Yes
14657	Also I got a philosophical difference.	No
35307	The fact is that our trade imbalance with China is much greater than it is with us, and it's only going to get worse every year.	Yes
12722	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	Yes
24058	And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	Yes
8236	It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
261	He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	Yes
35373	He has declared that he will replace Obamacare and make sure that all the positive aspects of it are included, leaving you to worry.	Yes
35739	That has increased by $2,500 annually.	Yes
195	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	No
22732	I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	No
11851	It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.	No
35185	Our goal is to ensure that our aid goes directly to those who require it, by setting a limit of 130 percent.	Yes
20019	And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	No
6590	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	No
2145	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	No
18894	I did a lot of work on this.	No
21891	That's the way the game's played now.	No
33823	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	No
20983	And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	No
8012	But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	No
35354	HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, which I support, and the Dingle-Norwood bill that the Governor opposes.	Yes
16306	Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	No
27801	And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	Yes
31858	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	No
839	And I believe that he will be outstanding.	No
10804	He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	Yes
35409	A person who does not veto a bill that provides investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, and research and development tax credits, like Mr. Bush did.	Yes
22240	Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	Yes
16261	I am concerned about what that does to our future.	No
2416	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	Yes
7682	Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	No
3681	We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	No
32088	She got it from the United States Congress.	Yes
22177	I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.	No
2638	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
34813	The budget may be impacted by $900 billion, according to projections.	Yes
4125	And you know what happened?	No
15237	The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	Yes
32002	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	No
10678	We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.	No
35034	The secretary of defense referred to the trillion-dollar military budget cuts as devastating, not my own.	Yes
3430	How's it going to affect my house?	No
1330	Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	No
3955	So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	No
22089	Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	No
22	And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.	No
8143	I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	No
19585	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	No
11896	The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	No
25054	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	No
33633	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	No
35675	The game refuges have been expanded by millions of acres in the wilderness lands.	Yes
33747	I have fought against that as a senator.	Yes
34907	The war was not my favorite topic of discussion.	Yes
20615	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	No
6898	The government doesn't require you to do anything.	No
10908	I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.	No
3356	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	No
21761	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	No
35008	Our plan is to promote democracy in Pakistan, increase non-military aid to facilitate cooperation with them, and pursue the militants.	Yes
19475	There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	Yes
5653	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	Yes
17594	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	No
28367	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	No
2999	Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	Yes
8473	And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	Yes
3808	The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.	No
21042	Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	No
10381	Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	No
34521	They conveyed nuclear secrets to nations like Syria, potentially.	Yes
2424	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	Yes
22200	And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	No
22724	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	Yes
1421	Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	Yes
23614	But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	No
35271	He has a deficit that is four times larger than the one Mr. Nixon had on his own.	Yes
21201	I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	No
34740	According to Congressional committees, it is necessary to allocate roughly $10 billion for this purpose.	Yes
28200	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	No
13192	That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	Yes
138	So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	No
26231	To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	No
24134	I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	No
28784	That's the best way to get people back in the system.	No
25573	I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	No
1601	There are no magic answers to do it.	No
32764	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	Yes
23820	I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.	Yes
20849	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	No
11649	But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	No
8341	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	No
35325	On May fifteenth, the Vice President signaled that flights were still being operated after the U-2 flight was canceled by the Administration and the President on May twelfth.	Yes
35399	According to a Gallup Poll conducted in February of this year, the majority of respondents from eight out of nine countries predicted that the Soviet Union would be ahead militarily and scientifically by 1970.	Yes
18835	My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	Yes
22497	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	No
33069	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	No
31891	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	No
15210	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	No
24040	Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	Yes
14662	And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.	No
10832	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	Yes
29326	You were totally in favor of it.	Yes
28538	But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	No
1064	I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	No
35601	Following President Carter's election, the National Education Association was honored for sending delegates to the Democratic convention, providing 99.5 percent of their money, and supporting the President. Additionally, many teachers choose to send their children to private or better public schools.	Yes
1938	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	No
12841	Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	No
33598	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	No
13255	I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	No
13669	Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	Yes
19273	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	No
34492	Despite the fact that we have the largest generation of public school students in history, there is now a smaller percentage of voters consisting of parents with children due to our ageing population.	Yes
4033	And we honor all the service that they've provided.	No
17238	Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	Yes
18680	I'd have made a better choice.	No
16270	And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	No
10500	Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.	No
2859	The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	No
13925	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
27397	Bob, I just need to comment on this.	No
7050	It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.	No
2337	It wasn't thought through properly.	No
34573	The people are the ones who have to take care of that, right?	Yes
35782	The current record shows that America is a peaceful and resilient nation, with an increase in employment opportunities for ten million workers, higher incomes, reduced criminal activity, and welfare payments.	Yes
17279	I have a deep religious faith.	No
19556	Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	No
14934	We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	No
9573	"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	No
1205	I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	Yes
13274	Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	Yes
29951	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	No
3963	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	No
19320	How does he avoid conflict?	No
21226	Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	No
16132	It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	No
27476	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	No
25073	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	No
23973	We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	No
1720	So all of this is possible.	No
17654	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	No
15703	They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	No
34033	I think they're going to see through it.	No
29289	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	No
35119	I thought I had no idea, but after consulting with experts, they informed me that it would cause disruption for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
7795	And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	No
33461	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	No
11836	And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.	No
32839	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	Yes
21611	But there's going to be a new Congress.	No
21647	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	No
14685	They don't want us talking about each other.	No
8247	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	No
362	We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	No
15770	And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	No
22087	What do we have to do?	No
21260	You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	No
3116	Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	Yes
15629	I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.	No
29487	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	No
6734	And that's to be honored.	No
21203	I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	No
19528	But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	Yes
1358	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.	No
32437	I have no loans from Russia.	Yes
28923	If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	No
9823	How about the growth of the economy?	No
22572	The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
16235	Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.	No
35805	My state has achieved a greater reduction in crime than any other industrial state in the United States, which is one of the reasons why.	Yes
34963	In our five-year plan for leasing offshore lands, we proposed to drill more land than was previously available for drilling since the program began in 1954.	Yes
26629	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	No
35389	He is currently troubled by the current deficits, despite his belief that an increase in the deficit would lead to economic growth and lower unemployment rates, which was previously estimated at $52 billion.	Yes
30219	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	Yes
15554	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	Yes
22448	Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.	No
12639	I have seen us ignore Africa.	No
7876	Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	Yes
6206	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	Yes
21999	Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	No
3700	We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	No
5862	We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.	Yes
16956	It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	No
16564	So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	No
18569	You have to close the borders.	No
2328	But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	Yes
12604	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	Yes
35100	The extent of Senator Obama's connection with ACORN, who could be committing serious frauds and jeopardizing the fabric of democracy in this country is something we should not forget.	Yes
81	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	Yes
546	We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	No
5687	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	Yes
18445	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	No
34606	He resorted to deporting undocumented workers for underpayment, as many employers do when they complain about their pay.	Yes
3765	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	Yes
34974	During the Bush administration, the Kurdish people were present at the State Department to negotiate and work on their differences.	Yes
26168	I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	No
18963	I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	No
13085	We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	No
28324	We need to have accountability.	No
20303	The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.	Yes
3750	We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.	Yes
2829	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	No
12993	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	Yes
9653	Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	No
34929	He expressed his belief that Saddam Hussein was a significant danger and now regrets the decision to overthrow him.	Yes
10759	I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.	No
8858	The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	Yes
9214	And we would have lost a million jobs.	Yes
12543	It encourages them to begin a war.	No
514	I know what strong political leadership is.	No
12454	I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	No
22129	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	No
29857	I'd just like to respond.	No
27102	When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	Yes
19956	Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	No
28935	I think it is a deterrent.	No
27772	We want a world that's stable.	No
24498	Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	Yes
1851	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	Yes
3020	And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	No
35281	According to him, Arkansas is a state with low economic growth.	Yes
34660	A more efficient and comprehensive approach will be necessary to help prevent terror and Islamic extremism from affecting the world.	Yes
15182	And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	No
1704	Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	No
27630	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	No
23915	"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago."""	No
6571	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	No
27872	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	No
24775	But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	No
27527	And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	Yes
6254	But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	No
8786	And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	No
31909	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	No
19992	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	No
32031	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	No
15539	More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	Yes
19292	We worked too hard to lower it.	No
16662	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	No
34845	Our troops will be back home at that time.	Yes
17224	Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.	No
14332	That gets to the national honor.	No
16846	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	Yes
34816	As a senator, I have put up resistance against that.	Yes
32813	She doesn't get it done.	No
9889	We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.	No
29600	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	Yes
35178	The project will take place over a period of several years.	Yes
14618	I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.	No
32103	And so please, go to...	No
5721	First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.	Yes
1370	But that's as far as I would go with it.	No
22337	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	No
28448	We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	No
17206	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	No
1343	The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	Yes
7251	I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	No
17098	So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	Yes
13298	And that's my view now.	No
3828	But we have to use our military wisely.	No
12303	That's not the way I would have done it.	No
27536	And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	No
35801	Convince oneself that Arkansas is terribly inadequate in terms of its surroundings and support for law enforcement.	Yes
35376	According to the CBO, a $2 trillion gap in Social Security could be created if the president's proposal is approved, as most current workers contribute to this system for retirees.	Yes
6940	Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	No
35508	He served two terms in the Senate, one of which was his second term.	Yes
17892	Will our children be better off?	No
16844	Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	Yes
10234	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	Yes
14400	Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.	Yes
17814	And the result is exactly what we see.	No
16167	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	Yes
12221	And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	No
34574	The president's troops were transferred, resulting in an additional 10 times more troops in Iraq than in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is located.	Yes
29486	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	No
897	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	No
27668	Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	No
26912	Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.	No
31889	I apologize to my family.	No
1757	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	No
21812	So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	No
11030	My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	No
15687	We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	No
16191	But I'm not going to do that.	No
2377	Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.	No
14760	Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?	No
21233	I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.	No
6144	Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.	No
1922	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	No
18737	We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.	Yes
34205	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	No
2199	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	Yes
12155	There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	No
8783	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	Yes
5547	He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.	No
9810	In fact, he doubled it.	Yes
9216	But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	No
14646	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	Yes
34818	The President has done this for the first time in the 20th century, and therefore, I don't want to see the deficit being sunk by a tax program that cannot be paid for, which will result in higher interest rates and payment of what you actually get from fewer taxes. Therefore, we need to continue expanding the markets.	Yes
16449	There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	No
33048	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	No
945	The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	No
34967	The program was utilized by approximately fourteen to fifteen thousand people.	Yes
21213	And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	No
7947	And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	No
1250	Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	No
17352	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	No
12519	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	No
8158	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	No
21510	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	No
28262	I strongly believe in local control of schools.	No
22580	The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	Yes
21877	He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.	Yes
3105	He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
16454	Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	No
241	We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	No
869	I've picked a lot of people.	No
1970	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	No
13520	Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	Yes
2296	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	Yes
21645	So you've got to create jobs.	No
20616	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	No
20539	I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	No
35362	He granted you the most substantial tax increase ever and attempted to take control of your healthcare system.	Yes
13405	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	No
20571	It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	No
12066	But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	No
32589	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	No
19269	Well, the people need it, that's the point.	No
24099	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	Yes
35108	Despite efforts, the US Senate Republicans once again prevented the passage of a crime bill that would have addressed some of these issues.	Yes
35259	It was a personal decision for me and others to attempt to identify the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, which holds great significance in my religious beliefs.	Yes
13449	They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.	Yes
8992	But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.	No
35268	By overriding my vetoed bills, Congress has contributed approximately $13 billion to the federal deficit and expenses.	Yes
13419	The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	Yes
32188	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	No
18142	More in July than June.	Yes
13393	I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	No
21875	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	No
19153	Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.	Yes
6829	And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	Yes
19116	I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	No
19157	We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	Yes
20600	Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	No
1033	"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	No
11207	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	No
8869	Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	Yes
23473	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	Yes
7068	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	No
19828	I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	No
25984	But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	No
29927	But let me just tell you.	No
22610	After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	No
10992	Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	No
35640	In Texas, I worked with the legislature, comprising both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that ensured admission to college for those in the top 10% of their high school class.	Yes
18128	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.	Yes
14325	We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	Yes
23990	I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	No
24295	Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	Yes
30227	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	No
7958	I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	No
35352	The majority of active-duty Army divisions, 9 out of 10, are either in Iraq, on a tour of duty, or have returned from war.	Yes
34744	The government's takeover of health care was not the case.	Yes
12928	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	Yes
8446	But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.	No
5976	We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.	No
28639	Every day is earth day if you own the land.	No
16291	Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	No
27910	That will not help us compete with China.	Yes
7101	Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.	Yes
8599	The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.	Yes
3824	We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	Yes
7977	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	No
3887	And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	No
34989	The national unemployment rate is at an all-time low, despite the emergence of 22 million new jobs.	Yes
26599	Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	No
2161	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	Yes
749	We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	No
12199	The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	No
2651	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	No
23023	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	No
34451	Our inner cities are a disaster.	No
7330	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	No
21231	It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.	No
22823	Didn't bring in enough nation.	No
6036	That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	No
23089	And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.	Yes
10447	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	No
2147	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	Yes
15121	And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.	No
6742	I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.	No
1322	But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	No
5659	Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	No
22124	And only the US could do this.	No
26127	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	No
27455	It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	No
34499	I have a fundamental deviation from the current administration, as with many other matters.	Yes
300	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	No
12020	He is for registration of guns.	Yes
11564	I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.	No
14818	I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	No
6754	And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.	No
35872	The budget of $15 billion was sought to be reduced by him in 1975.	Yes
8084	It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	No
20272	He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.	Yes
10864	And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.	No
1387	Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	Yes
7208	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
16542	But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.	Yes
16766	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	No
35608	We constructed 84 new mental health treatment centers.	Yes
26822	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	No
12634	The rest either abstained or voted against us.	Yes
34654	I vetoed the budget you passed, which included $30 billion in education budget cuts, to ensure that our children receive better education opportunities.	Yes
20082	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	No
13750	I want the line-item veto.	No
17188	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	No
34611	Mr. Movers has made it clear that a tax cut is not the case now, and with the onset of renewed inflation, he called for restraint on Federal spending. He also proposed an emergency excise tax on gasoline 15 months ago.	Yes
33376	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	Yes
24825	This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	No
34485	Although President Ford is respected, he should not be embarrassed to make the same statement since we have the highest unemployment rate in history.	Yes
27452	I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	No
29778	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	No
17036	The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	No
18104	The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.	Yes
35547	Second, I'm annoyed because we should be protecting them and giving us the amount agreed upon by treaty and contract.	Yes
29431	They're going to expand their companies.	No
6995	I will not cut the benefits.	No
12925	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	Yes
3095	Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.	Yes
27246	The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
4253	And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
23145	The federal government is going to run it.	No
33216	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	Yes
19192	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	Yes
20573	He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	No
11984	But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	No
11990	In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	Yes
23764	And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	No
29528	And in a way, I should be complaining.	No
33702	They're growing at 8 percent.	Yes
2661	This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	No
16794	Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	Yes
35551	If India were to lose her battle, with three quarters of the world's population living within her borders, I believe that our forces could be weakened.	Yes
35292	It's peculiar that he made the decision to decrease the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion after 1993.	Yes
3635	It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	No
13598	I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	Yes
22369	I hope a lot of --	No
31852	Well, I actually agree with that.	No
15538	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	No
22113	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	Yes
19616	I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	Yes
35250	I'm confident that it's achievable and will result in a decrease in inflation, as I did in California.	Yes
5891	Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
7337	This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	Yes
22963	I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	No
4003	Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	No
23861	I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	No
34755	I've witnessed instances where abortions were used as a form of birth control, for goodness' sake.	Yes
9522	Getting us to a balanced budget.	No
3058	And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	No
16560	It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	No
30276	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	No
11469	The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.	No
35186	My e-mails were subject to a year-long FBI investigation.	Yes
29692	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	No
442	I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.	No
8484	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	No
9354	Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	Yes
35689	This is the most significant turnaround in the country's history.	Yes
7739	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	No
12645	And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	No
26062	You got two years to look for a job.	No
35055	We are in a mess with an outstanding debt of $20 trillion.	Yes
27098	We organized the Friends of Syria.	No
4227	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	No
19976	So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	No
12969	It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.	Yes
11239	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	No
34957	Eleven of them have been overturned.	Yes
24131	I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.	No
35725	The housing market has begun to see an increase.	Yes
2584	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	No
24110	And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	No
8826	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.	Yes
22181	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	No
3684	There are some things that I think have to be done.	No
13621	And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	No
25435	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	No
21983	It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.	No
25823	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	No
34506	In Detroit, Michigan, the black unemployment rate is 56%, indicating significant progress made by Government spending.	Yes
28901	I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	No
13625	But not by raising taxes.	No
19669	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	Yes
34288	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	No
4279	I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	Yes
14231	We can't get anything done.	No
23063	We're not talking about third-world drugs.	No
18964	And so I've told him my opinion.	No
34617	Medicare will offer prescription drug coverage to seniors for the first time in 2006.	Yes
15493	And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	No
18132	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	No
17717	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	No
20898	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	Yes
16381	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	No
17326	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	No
6150	Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	Yes
13349	He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	No
34862	The significance of Pell Grants is undeniable, at 6 billion dollars.	Yes
28302	Look, we're in an information age.	No
24094	People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	Yes
28847	Are you for it without quotas?	No
24361	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	No
18184	I believe in protecting America first.	No
26286	If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	Yes
24201	Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	No
16830	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	Yes
795	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	No
25529	We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	No
19025	I believe we can be successful.	No
168	Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	No
20940	Start asking the question, what do you know?	No
35164	It is my opinion that this Administration has not met the will of most members of Congress on two separate occasions through the implementation of bills.	Yes
16970	So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	No
19959	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	No
3437	And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	No
8999	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	Yes
7136	We're not allowed to vote on it.	Yes
29502	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	Yes
35838	The parents of a young man who died serving our country, Mr. and Mrs. Khan, were targeted by him because they were religious.	Yes
345	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	No
17232	So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	No
3424	I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	No
8830	Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	No
7806	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	No
23447	And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	No
24377	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	Yes
34892	China's control over North Korea is far greater than our own.	Yes
27034	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	No
10312	I want high wage, high skill jobs.	No
35536	Despite the fact that six Democrats and five Republicans lost their jobs due to economic struggles, this president was the only one who managed to avoid such problems.	Yes
18099	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	No
32265	They'll never be the same.	No
13125	Now, that is the issue.	No
26323	This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	No
14715	That is my commitment to you.	No
18056	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	No
11245	We haven't been doing enough of that.	No
13404	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	No
12797	But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	No
723	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	No
35341	In the second quarter, we had a Consumer Price Index that was around 12%, as per my understanding.	Yes
13966	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	Yes
16461	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	Yes
16253	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	No
12346	That's an interruption, by the way.	No
25198	But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	Yes
10561	This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	No
35256	Their population includes 4 million children who are citizens of the United States and 15 million individuals.	Yes
4065	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	No
16630	When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	Yes
28552	I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.	No
15489	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	No
20326	I believe we ought to give seniors more options.	No
35355	Lynn Martin is battling against the glass ceiling and doing an outstanding job.	Yes
25253	I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	No
24417	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	No
19356	He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.	Yes
25585	I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	No
23727	Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	No
19820	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	No
8912	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	No
29515	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	Yes
34246	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	No
25058	I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	No
34964	I vetoed $16 billion in new spending, among other things.	Yes
32379	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	Yes
16111	That is absolutely not true.	No
4104	Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	No
23721	"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off."""	No
17847	Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	No
1827	That is, I want to bring down rates.	No
2804	The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.	No
21363	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	Yes
15637	And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
19167	But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.	No
33055	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	Yes
3944	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	Yes
24109	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	No
23825	The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	No
604	I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	No
24030	And I don't want to do that.	No
2759	The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.	No
351	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	No
29204	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	No
8937	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	Yes
34568	There will be a scarcity of oil in world markets due to at least five credible studies, including one from the American Petroleum Institute, which indicate that the total global demand for oil will exceed the available supplies by the end of the decade.	Yes
19202	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	Yes
34689	The Kurdish people have been our most trusted allies in Syria and Iraq.	Yes
1186	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	No
7069	After all, I was a border governor for a while.	No
24456	Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption.	Yes
18687	No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	Yes
28142	The governor talked about Medicare.	No
4246	That made no sense whatsoever.	No
6119	And this is your plan, John.	No
2944	And let me cite several examples.	No
20480	And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	No
299	You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.	No
5492	They're hurting, and they're angry.	No
6755	I think we have to respect that.	No
27164	Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.	No
1602	But I believe together we can make great progress.	No
10716	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	No
35396	The dear leader's health status is unknown today, but we do know that the North Koreans have violated all agreements they made.	Yes
19661	So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	No
15191	It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	No
7231	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	Yes
32831	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	No
22219	And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.	No
15970	In other states, we've done it.	Yes
13168	We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	No
2557	We use something called Race to the Top.	No
25415	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	No
23407	If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	No
22486	This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	Yes
7627	I believe we should have a stronger military force.	No
17978	All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	No
23305	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	No
8212	But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	No
5899	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	No
20536	Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.	No
26462	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	No
24435	I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	No
12512	Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	No
8019	We should come to its defense.	No
23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	No
3131	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	Yes
35524	They are currently present in 32 countries.	Yes
28711	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	No
15180	I am not talking of scrapping.	No
35868	More than a decade ago, I made the decision to postpone the production of the F - 14, and I will explain why.	Yes
30432	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	No
658	We ought to say this is good.	No
89	I asked for and received the same briefing.	No
8875	And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	No
19187	Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
1874	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	Yes
17763	And give us a plan.	No
17793	Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	No
14992	"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	No
23947	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	No
19683	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	Yes
4327	We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	No
2973	And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	No
16572	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	No
29645	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	No
18012	We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	No
32135	And it hasn't been finished at all.	No
33270	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	No
14066	All these things take a few minutes.	No
35230	We're settling into a single conflict.	Yes
34880	Families with no financial limit were still able to obtain low-interest college loans during the previous administration.	Yes
15908	Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	No
25762	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	No
23079	I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.	No
31984	His was what he's done to women.	No
10792	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	No
19296	I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	No
16597	When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	Yes
14055	But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.	No
13423	He suggested that we aid distressed areas.	No
18880	I have no intention of wilting.	No
18237	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	No
3639	Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	Yes
14876	But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	No
34516	More than $100 billion in tax reductions and incentives have been given to him.	Yes
23680	And I'll take responsibility for them.	No
26347	We had a better idea.	No
7465	When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.	No
20703	We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	No
20740	I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	No
465	As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	Yes
31979	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	No
33742	I'll be against it when I'm president.	No
35550	My state has become the sole nation to offer universal health care, thanks to the support of business, labor, and healthcare professionals, as well as from virtually all areas of the state.	Yes
6787	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	No
35375	The point is that we have finally witnessed Republicans and Democrats negotiating and coming to a package.	Yes
9736	You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	No
31845	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	No
29925	He should have produced it a long time before.	No
14084	We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	Yes
21264	There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	No
12998	America has not been standing still.	No
33616	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	Yes
26355	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	No
1734	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	No
10708	I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	Yes
14586	He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
9967	You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	No
34398	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	No
14421	Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
17222	The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	Yes
22918	And they're over there, not over here.	No
26453	Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	No
30406	Where did you find this?	No
13216	I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	No
15518	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	Yes
29781	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	Yes
17852	I promised a new beginning.	No
18258	You've got to help us over there.	No
2456	Let me make one last point.	No
12115	I think that's the very best way to go.	No
23911	Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	No
3615	But, again, I want to return.	No
26661	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	No
4192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	No
20067	And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	No
34335	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	No
3900	We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	No
19638	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	No
21499	So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	No
28780	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	No
8581	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	No
2246	That's -- that's a big topic.	No
2380	And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	Yes
2517	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	No
3256	Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	No
15767	The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	No
7119	And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	No
6117	Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.	No
6636	Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	Yes
22303	It ought to be tried.	No
20005	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	No
33361	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	Yes
7467	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	No
17590	Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	No
35751	He thinks that it makes him look more attractive than me because I voted for it.	Yes
15713	And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	No
16710	When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
1487	But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	No
31843	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	No
13518	Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	Yes
1917	And we talk about evidence.	No
27263	And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
19369	All 50 states did it.	Yes
22034	There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	No
3238	Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	Yes
2967	(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	No
29584	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	No
3922	He did not say that.	No
29850	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	No
35192	Four years ago, when I was present, I declared that I would decrease taxes for middle-class households.	Yes
23298	Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	No
24642	2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	No
2549	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	No
23507	Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.	No
1172	I'd say, several hundred of them.	No
34715	The Guards and Reserves are performing two distinct functions.	Yes
17327	But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	No
21856	You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	No
77	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	Yes
25227	A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	No
23495	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	No
24271	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	Yes
5872	Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	Yes
12140	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	Yes
29822	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	No
30124	And I think that's great.	No
14247	I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	No
35846	The defense budget has been raised, of course.	Yes
34004	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	No
16616	Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	Yes
13696	I'll give you an example.	No
34536	Despite being an agency that was once highly responsible and sought after for home ownership, FHA experienced a six million dollar decline in revenue last year.	Yes
22082	I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	No
2492	Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.	No
2826	We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	No
23929	Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	No
27390	I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	No
35896	The federal government is funding only 7% of the total education cost, as an example.	Yes
18920	And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	No
34584	The government has been reduced in size by over 300,000 people in the past few years, and I am now leading this project of reinventing government.	Yes
15407	Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	No
35217	He declared that he would initiate military operations in Pakistan.	Yes
21015	We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.	Yes
23641	My opponent was against that.	Yes
19045	We will continue to stay on the offense.	No
35239	The treaty does not mandate the United States to defend anything other than Formosa and the Pescadores, or to deal with any acts against that region.	Yes
7084	And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	No
2984	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	No
22845	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	No
32171	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	Yes
21214	I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	No
18944	It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	No
18362	Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	No
20496	I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	No
7881	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	No
20143	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	No
26084	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	No
24427	This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	No
20405	And here is the simple difference.	No
18213	We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	Yes
29582	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	No
3962	You don't say that out loud.	No
2111	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	No
34992	I believe my record is a solid one, considering my opposition to sending the Marines to Lebanon, supporting our efforts in Kosovo, Bosnia, and the first Gulf War.	Yes
28584	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	No
16157	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	Yes
13428	This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	Yes
30309	Words matter when you run for president.	No
7091	The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	No
24409	But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	No
35017	The book authored by Vice President Gore included a suggestion to tax excessive energy taxes to ensure environmental sustainability.	Yes
18748	With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	Yes
15059	There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	No
15454	This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	No
7729	And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	No
35160	It has been four years, but we are now closer to achieving a nuclear Iran.	Yes
14690	Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
448	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	No
32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	No
9035	And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	No
17870	Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	Yes
32855	To go back to the very, very first question.	No
20868	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	No
18338	Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	Yes
21866	You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.	No
18531	I think my plan is better.	No
12075	But I feel very strongly about that.	No
17588	Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	Yes
33886	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	Yes
24038	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	No
19094	Four years ago you took me on faith.	No
35906	What about the drugs that have experienced a surge and double digit growth in the past 44 months?	Yes
13766	I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	No
8506	It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	No
19599	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	No
29231	And that's a big, big factor.	No
7988	And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	No
28348	We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	No
28772	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	No
13872	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	No
29939	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	Yes
14176	There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	Yes
25154	And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	Yes
22641	He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.	Yes
29275	So I will tell you this.	No
23102	It's in my health-care proposal.	Yes
35391	The reason they favor it is that it doesn't meet the requirements for remitting decisions to doctors and nurses, providing access to emergency room services without an HMO, or necessitating calling 911, and having bipartisan support.	Yes
24369	We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	Yes
7830	But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	No
2494	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	Yes
17860	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	Yes
35718	Medicare is designed to help seniors, particularly those on a fixed income, rise out of poverty.	Yes
25584	This evening we talked about national strength.	No
2862	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	No
23620	And I have to make that judgment.	No
22793	General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	Yes
34504	The President affixed it.	Yes
16778	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	Yes
3270	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	Yes
35387	Unlike my opponent, he is an expert in national defense and helped modify the INF treaty to ensure a sound deal when discussing freezing.	Yes
13640	This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.	No
619	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	No
29390	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	No
34500	Delaware's laws on credit cards are very relaxed, which is why everyone goes there.	Yes
14387	And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	Yes
23070	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	Yes
14912	At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	Yes
6661	Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.	No
12153	And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	Yes
32423	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	No
35265	In the next 10 years, we anticipate spending approximately $43 billion on enhancing our nation's transportation infrastructure through the windfall profits tax.	Yes
1915	My priority is putting people back to work in America.	No
2680	We cut taxes 19 times.	Yes
1829	And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	No
19821	I'm not some extremist out here.	No
20730	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	No
3716	And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	Yes
17727	That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	No
27120	And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	No
7157	It's to make sure we raise standards.	No
1972	And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.	Yes
6048	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	Yes
21046	I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.	No
15097	These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	No
2644	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	Yes
11686	During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	No
19626	We have not been firm and strong.	No
16353	But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
17426	I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	No
35491	The Nobel laureate in South Africa stated that the government is seen as working alongside its oppressive regime, just two days ago.	Yes
29175	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	No
25944	And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.	Yes
9342	And so what we did was take away those leases.	No
35448	The assault weapons ban in the Senate was met with strong opposition from Senator Dole, who nearly quashed the crime bill by opposing it because the National Rifle Association opposed it, much like they did with the Brady Bill.	Yes
26188	And so let me just say this.	No
17277	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	No
20665	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	No
15639	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	No
32706	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	No
33362	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	No
18059	I don't believe the United States did that.	No
19467	They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.	Yes
24331	We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	No
35299	We were able to elevate our schools to the level of excellence in my state.	Yes
3010	It's a matter of being strong.	No
26113	Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	Yes
24000	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	No
12515	And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?	No
25693	Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	No
19196	And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	No
7755	They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.	Yes
1889	But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.	No
11326	It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	No
7402	I think we've got a lot more work to do.	No
31945	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	No
29373	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
2478	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	No
29827	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	No
26258	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	No
14346	I'd like to see those written instructions.	No
20027	And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	No
2909	In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	Yes
13251	Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	Yes
574	I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	Yes
20711	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	No
16009	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	No
793	And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	No
28161	That adds up to 44 million people.	Yes
28139	And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	Yes
3874	And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	No
16149	And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	No
27840	Let -- let -- let's...	No
28827	And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.	No
22476	Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	No
15863	I thank you for that.	No
8975	The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.	Yes
29102	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	No
14819	I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.	No
27387	We're now at under 285.	Yes
35779	For every $15 you've saved, there's $1 left over.	Yes
4203	You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	No
32964	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	No
13325	He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	Yes
1566	But our country is innately very strong.	No
24930	We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.	Yes
711	We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.	Yes
31	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	No
9730	And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	Yes
6741	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	No
19991	I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.	No
22493	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	No
881	And I'm very very proud of that choice.	No
20283	I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	No
35130	Are there any plans for Guinea and Ghana to become independent countries in Africa, given their recent voting with the Communists?	Yes
32743	How -- why would these people stay there?	No
12630	I don't think they do, enough.	No
26455	In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.	Yes
8864	What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.	No
18672	And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	No
25550	Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	No
9880	The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.	No
20338	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	Yes
7123	We could speed it up.	No
20636	And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	No
2892	I've talked to them and I've listened.	No
35540	I want to point out that Senator Dole's vote resulted in a $900 billion increase in taxes.	Yes
33951	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	Yes
12528	We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	Yes
21120	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	No
18571	But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	No
8199	We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.	Yes
29001	Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.	No
33687	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	No
525	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	Yes
15816	He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	Yes
5501	Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	No
729	We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	No
35548	I voted against it, but Senator Obama supported it.	Yes
35867	My state's drug education and prevention program is a source of pride for the nation, as stated by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.	Yes
34147	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	No
25051	We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	No
22999	I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	No
17154	"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	No
12099	It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	No
16476	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	Yes
25882	I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	Yes
24107	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	No
926	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	No
1169	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	No
21211	And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.	No
7526	And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	No
29962	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	No
7603	Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	No
8089	And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	Yes
24029	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	No
15072	In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	Yes
25948	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	No
35198	Prime Minister Rabin has stated that the Soviet Union's position in the Middle East is weaker now than it has been for many years.	Yes
35167	There have been many talented women in our history for a considerable duration.	Yes
5664	But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.	No
24981	But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.	No
2733	I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.	No
15593	That's not what we are going to do.	No
18834	There's nothing wrong with that.	No
16629	There's no way to get the answer to a question.	No
848	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	No
1061	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	No
26825	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	No
11509	When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.	No
34863	Since the completion of our economic plan, the average family income has increased by more than $1600.	Yes
3296	But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.	No
22306	Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	No
15852	But he's in the arena.	No
25315	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	Yes
9015	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	No
12927	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	Yes
7841	We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
6981	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	Yes
15893	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	No
11742	I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	No
28801	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	Yes
923	In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	No
32464	Well, why didn't she change it?	No
15341	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.	No
35493	The allocation of Federal funds for enhancing education has increased by 73%.	Yes
19550	And institutions are beginning to function.	No
17909	These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	No
34805	He foresees that deficits will be nearly as high as those in the next four years.	Yes
447	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	No
20090	President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.	Yes
14174	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	No
16024	I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	Yes
8616	As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	No
20348	Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	Yes
11032	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	No
18235	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	No
20827	It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	No
12565	We must have a great goal.	No
35276	Senator D'Amato, who is also the co-chair of Senator Dole's campaign, has stated that he must cut Medicare to cover the expenses.	Yes
35777	The total funding for Head Start would be around 5 billion.	Yes
17684	The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	No
32074	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	No
8620	And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.	No
13819	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	No
29746	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	No
34403	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	No
5943	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	No
35831	To aid humanitarian relief efforts, we dispatched troops to Rwanda.	Yes
10736	It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.	Yes
14820	I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.	No
18068	My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	Yes
17150	And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.	Yes
23872	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	No
27031	...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	No
19889	If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	No
2432	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	Yes
33739	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	No
3704	Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	Yes
18101	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	No
15784	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	No
16625	But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	No
14245	Now, I think that's going back to where we started.	No
35573	I believe that the use of special forces and trainers in Iraq, which has yielded positive results, is in line with my personal preference.	Yes
32116	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	No
23186	Right, thank you for that.	No
32725	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	Yes
33013	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	No
7862	Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	No
24142	Now, we can do better.	No
8162	I want us to recapture that image.	No
15934	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	No
3186	The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	No
26003	Let's talk about them separately.	No
34650	We're once again engaged in a battle for control over Mosul.	Yes
9936	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	No
19486	Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.	Yes
26365	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	Yes
2340	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	No
35685	Senator Obama has authorized the storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
28116	That's part of an overall overhaul.	No
14958	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	No
21748	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	No
14915	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
7984	It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.	No
28837	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	No
25169	We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.	No
27708	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	Yes
16126	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	No
35121	When you assumed office, there were 32 million food stamp recipients.	Yes
34625	There was no indication of any US weapons found on the battlefield during the search.	Yes
471	It's as simple as that.	No
20146	And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	No
35085	Nevertheless, it will take into account pre-existing ailments.	Yes
31932	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	Yes
19893	You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	No
24204	This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.	No
21423	And everybody says they take responsibility.	No
27155	But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	No
28451	That's what a leader does.	No
12636	I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	No
27360	And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	No
16541	It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	No
15209	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	Yes
13105	Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	No
5611	I haven't made a promise about...	No
12445	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	No
15308	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	No
34641	Nevertheless, she does not indicate that President Obama has deported millions of people in the current state of affairs.	Yes
30419	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	No
3697	Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.	No
8448	Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.	No
29828	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	No
11038	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	No
32739	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	Yes
28251	Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	Yes
8872	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	Yes
24282	I have number 1 and 1A.	No
1302	And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	No
34769	The Congress of the United States authorized a sum of sixty-seven million dollars, which was more than what the President had intended for use up until last week.	Yes
8807	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	No
25162	First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.	Yes
6493	But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	No
20695	Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	No
13024	Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	Yes
19757	I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.	Yes
3800	I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	No
16665	At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	Yes
2218	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	No
22957	The when I can't tell you.	No
21376	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	Yes
14846	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	No
19193	So some may be better off.	No
13350	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	No
11677	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	No
3189	The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.	No
2513	I -- I have to respond to that.	No
35275	The number of Americans without jobs has increased by 5% in the current year compared to three months ago, and since Mr. Ford's first two years as president, unemployment has surged by 50%, from five million to two and a half million people out of work.	Yes
19944	I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	No
32611	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	No
26660	We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.	Yes
7794	This goes to our survival.	No
34053	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	No
1093	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	No
19159	I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.	No
27672	But we have some work to do.	No
26117	I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	No
11484	Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	No
19370	It took three and a half years.	Yes
18061	And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	Yes
7153	I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	No
35005	Governor Bush's budget proposal was less than half the amount I have allocated for this objective in my ten-year plan.	Yes
34064	This is -- this is a mindset.	No
32910	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	No
3100	But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	No
13458	Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	No
29732	And we have to be very strong.	No
17208	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	No
16741	These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	No
17387	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	Yes
13844	When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	Yes
25837	We need to help people who are between jobs.	No
70	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
8153	And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	No
19395	They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	No
13160	But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.	No
17680	I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	No
6324	That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	No
2112	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	No
18009	This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	No
34982	Alf Landon was against Social Security and President Nixon warned that John Kennedy's proposals would cause the country to go bankrupt, doubling its cost.	Yes
846	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	No
35496	The fact that black and Hispanic youth in cities are experiencing 55% youth unemployment is a significant concern.	Yes
355	And we've got to attend to them.	No
20310	If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	Yes
17532	Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.	Yes
2582	That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	No
23299	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	No
35295	Senator Obama is a newcomer, having requested $932 million in spending projects.	Yes
15410	But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	Yes
505	Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.	Yes
11857	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	Yes
4244	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	No
12881	They want to be free.	No
19695	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	No
2819	Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	Yes
1787	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	Yes
10171	What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.	No
28038	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	No
20987	In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	No
11237	But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.	No
20104	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	Yes
17186	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	No
8425	We need higher teachers' salaries.	No
16234	But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.	No
26604	It's something you might consider.	No
1476	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	No
21657	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	No
4085	They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	Yes
26369	He said it was a mistake.	No
12821	I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	No
19791	And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.	No
23370	Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	No
8329	But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	No
15241	The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	Yes
5930	And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	No
21556	But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	No
8979	And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	Yes
7591	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	No
34941	He affirms that he gave his consent to the resolution.	Yes
24676	And they will make those sacrifices.	No
26350	Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.	No
26925	And that's what we've done over the last four years.	No
34754	Taxing individuals who are above $200,000 will not result in a tax bill of $150 billion.	Yes
18334	My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	Yes
107	First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	No
22891	And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	Yes
3869	I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	No
20631	That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	No
12635	More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	Yes
35600	I voted for border security, and there are...	Yes
13849	We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.	Yes
19846	I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	No
34674	It is worth mentioning that there are 33,000 fatalities caused by guns each year, in hindsight.	Yes
19160	Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	No
34259	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	Yes
34468	We have exhausted our recovery funding for the addicts who are recovering.	Yes
28265	But here's what I said.	No
21948	It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	No
21620	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	No
35888	For the first time in history, you receive roughly 40 percent of your earnings.	Yes
13592	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	Yes
35776	By his own choice, the misery index has risen above 20% today, which I believe indicates something.	Yes
25927	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	No
5793	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	No
35795	Annually, trade grows at a rate of around 12 percent.	Yes
8459	It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	Yes
17321	And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	No
23331	Look at the record of the man running for the president.	No
28793	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	No
33462	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	No
11729	It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	No
30123	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	Yes
34588	His speech highlights a significant concept: convening ect to solve the problem in Iraq.	Yes
17494	It's been a good instinct.	No
27	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	No
35707	The majority of Americans, specifically 98%, are receiving a tax reduction and health care benefits.	Yes
29814	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	No
7997	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	No
1778	So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.	No
28849	Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?	No
32477	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	Yes
22496	We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	No
18605	The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.	Yes
23246	After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	Yes
21110	If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	No
1887	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	No
18157	No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.	No
19054	We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	No
3850	But that's Senate inside baseball.	No
13023	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	No
34935	The Black Congressional Caucus has not been represented by this president.	Yes
11288	The tensions will be ratcheted up.	No
8557	And I think we have a powerful country.	No
16910	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	No
26978	They don't happen to be accurate.	No
28904	Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	No
35860	After Japan, it is the second largest surplus.	Yes
32874	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	Yes
25504	And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.	Yes
21747	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	No
30075	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	No
8150	A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.	No
13972	Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	Yes
26645	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	No
2869	As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.	Yes
35113	The price of gasoline has surged by roughly $.50 per gallon since then, and a significant portion of it has been diverted to OPEC oil producers.	Yes
28102	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	No
22765	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	No
3081	So strong economy is very important.	No
24081	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	No
11812	But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	No
14518	Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.	No
27512	I think they noticed that as well.	No
22589	And that sends a confusing signal to people.	No
22264	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	No
17560	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	No
29693	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	No
26750	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	No
6535	All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.	Yes
22407	May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.	No
1219	Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	Yes
488	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	No
6270	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	No
4404	You know, my father came from Kenya.	No
12390	And so I think this is an issue.	No
15420	As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	No
23510	Now that's not a flip-flop.	No
29777	Property crime is down 40 percent.	Yes
28861	If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	No
11405	I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	No
7617	And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.	Yes
7893	I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.	Yes
17722	But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	Yes
3149	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	No
23335	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	No
23101	And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	No
23414	I have a plan to cover those folks.	Yes
18038	And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	No
34598	This year, he refused to approve tax cuts for the middle class.	Yes
19483	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	Yes
12257	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	No
35227	We have a debt of $4 trillion.	Yes
19983	It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	No
58	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
1298	There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	Yes
14466	Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	No
18559	The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	No
20982	I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.	No
7661	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	No
12553	It can and will grow even more in the next four.	No
8389	The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	Yes
21031	The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.	Yes
19888	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	No
19926	We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	Yes
33308	We have no country if we have no border.	No
26659	But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	No
3622	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	Yes
27080	We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.	No
20011	Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	No
32596	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	Yes
35111	Despite their faster growth than us, our total gross domestic product is only 40% of ours today.	Yes
10925	It is breaking family budgets.	No
6060	We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	No
15170	There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	Yes
35745	We informed him that we wouldn't intervene in his border dispute and refrained from revealing Ambassador Glaspie's papers from the 25th of July.	Yes
26788	The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	No
8602	I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.	No
31994	But it is things that people say.	No
13261	Now, why did they reject it?	No
13616	Government -- he says invest government, grow government.	No
17524	There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	Yes
557	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	No
2479	This is the private market.	No
19328	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	No
6799	I think it's important to promote a culture of life.	No
32211	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	Yes
6472	I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	No
25432	But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	No
35296	The violence has begun to dissipate within the last 24 hours.	Yes
20257	It's a difference of opinion.	No
21846	A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.	No
9310	With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	Yes
9010	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	No
6032	And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	No
2631	And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	No
15419	And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	No
1711	First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	Yes
9941	Instead let people make their own choice.	No
26354	We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	No
24565	In athletics, we know it.	No
34887	The governor has referred to Medicare as a government HMO.	Yes
35020	There have been a few cases where the Burger Court has issued technical rulings that led to an evidently guilty person being found guilty.	Yes
1058	If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.	No
7983	Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	No
26424	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	No
1608	And we have not set an example for our own people.	No
1462	There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	No
20229	I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.	No
886	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	No
3586	It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.	No
20084	And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	No
2898	Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	No
4325	Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	No
3670	Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	No
24685	Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	No
25969	That's what drug it out.	No
2617	But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	Yes
19630	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	No
16642	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	No
34653	The top 1% receives 223 of the new spending, which is significantly higher than the current 445 billion.	Yes
19606	Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	Yes
12305	But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.	No
35398	The increase in spending was halved by us.	Yes
34510	As you may have known, I received support from the ICE and Border Patrol agents last week.	Yes
26804	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	No
24368	We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.	Yes
3544	It's completely out of control.	No
17128	What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	No
8665	I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	Yes
18455	My opponent just said something amazing.	No
19864	And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	Yes
19645	Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	No
17797	As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.	No
35918	Despite this, he denounces my vetoes, which have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and potentially another $13 billion.	Yes
6516	Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.	Yes
16802	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	Yes
29132	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	Yes
35655	Seventy-five percent have been prosecuted.	Yes
17355	They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	Yes
20960	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	No
5623	Programs that we need, we should make them work better.	No
7132	It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.	No
1029	If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	No
5956	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	No
35546	The majority of American workers are employed by those businesses, accounting for 25%.	Yes
6952	We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	Yes
35011	The number of Americans without health insurance in the United States is forty-seven million.	Yes
7513	I ask you for your help.	No
3359	Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?	No
851	I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	No
14719	I know we can do better.	No
24292	When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	No
18064	The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	Yes
3078	And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	No
35157	It was the same Government that declared in 1920 that we had sufficient oil for 13 years, and then announced 19 years later that there was enough left for another 15 years.	Yes
149	And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	No
8745	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	No
32010	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	Yes
6127	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	Yes
11808	I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	No
22434	If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.	No
3846	He raised a whole bunch of them.	No
34600	When you first assumed office, you initiated the stimulus package and declared $16 billion in pork to be distributed throughout America.	Yes
35873	Under the tax code, if you are a single mother with two children and earn $22,000 annually, your marginal rate will be higher than that of someone earning over $200,000 per year.	Yes
9468	It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.	No
14468	The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	Yes
16701	But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	Yes
34006	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	Yes
478	I respect his right to disagree with me.	No
6230	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	Yes
335	I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	No
28255	I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	No
18594	The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	No
5500	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	Yes
3911	But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	No
26936	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	No
26390	We're going to do that with an economic package.	No
29942	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	No
8694	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	Yes
23504	This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	No
12977	I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	No
15048	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	No
10155	Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	Yes
17558	That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.	Yes
21196	This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	Yes
16676	He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.	Yes
9569	If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	Yes
28220	One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	No
1247	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	No
29376	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	No
30316	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	No
33959	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	No
11415	I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	No
20205	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	No
14743	To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.	No
1231	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	Yes
35228	He claimed that our opponent had already imposed sanctions on Iran, as per his own words.	Yes
19804	I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	No
154	But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	Yes
21165	I want to focus on results.	No
34821	I believe that it is present in more than three states, totaling 40.	Yes
20429	I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	No
6716	We have more people who qualify.	Yes
24687	And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	No
1367	I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	No
2872	After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.	Yes
12697	We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.	No
2618	When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	No
25285	That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	No
8216	And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	No
17556	In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	Yes
12124	So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	No
4377	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	No
3510	Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.	No
19881	And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.	No
24675	The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	No
4320	But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	No
8695	I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	No
27274	That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	No
32286	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	No
11475	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	Yes
35311	We've never witnessed anything like this happening in our elections before.	Yes
29775	Now, I believe in community policing.	No
10445	We've got to make sure that works properly.	No
29235	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
17220	We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.	No
24681	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	No
8603	Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	No
3285	And let me make another observation.	No
9916	I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	No
17037	The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	No
35166	Our oil imports account for approximately 44 percent.	Yes
8055	I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.	No
16686	Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
24083	These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.	No
27789	And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	No
11513	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	No
24033	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	No
34872	They are being crushed, and a significant number of them are going bankrupt due to health care.	Yes
35300	The only other action I will not take is to withdraw $29 million from his state pension fund, which is equivalent to taking out the Social Security trust fund at the federal level.	Yes
26050	On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	Yes
7724	Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.	No
17374	As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.	No
6500	I don't really think about him very much.	No
29517	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	No
35098	All individuals experienced a rise in their income.	Yes
5918	Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	No
20108	The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.	No
7675	These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	No
22457	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	No
13312	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	No
11300	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	No
35045	Today, American planes are providing assistance for humanitarian relief in Sarajevo.	Yes

1362	And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.	No
26263	Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.	No
28717	But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	No

8204	But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	No
29884	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	No
34779	Let me clarify: I did not vote to reduce COLAs.	Yes
15754	And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	No
8503	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	Yes

30145	And you're going to stop them?	No
27143	The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	No

19553	But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	No
26766	So we want to end discrimination.	No
14016	Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	No

754	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	No
5537	And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	No

35790	"Every scientist in the country will immediately state that the stem cells provided are ""insufficient"" due to their contamination by mouse cells and the limited number of contaminated cells, which is only 11 to 20."	Yes
24550	This is a relevant question here tonight.	No
13644	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	No
18111	The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	No
34931	Despite my belief that the assault weapons ban should be extended, I was informed that it would not be implemented due to opposition from both Republicans and Democrats.	Yes
5511	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	No

29354	But you have no plan.	No
25593	That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	No
15528	And so I'm proud of my choice.	No
5852	And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.	No
29965	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	Yes
13275	Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	No

23035	And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	No
28848	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	No
6923	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	No
19827	So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	No
10766	You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.	Yes
17204	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	No

3185	The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	No
9650	You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	No
27598	And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	No
16705	I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	Yes
1407	I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.	No
9177	Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	No
14683	"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."	Yes
21551	So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.	No
11088	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	No
27852	We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	No
4093	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	No
33528	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	Yes
1296	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	Yes
24670	Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	No
26057	You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	No
33195	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	Yes
8689	conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	No
311	Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.	No
34752	It is my opinion that an agricultural policy of this administration should not incur the 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars per year that has been incurred over the past three or four years.	Yes
16594	I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	No
26712	When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.	Yes
24847	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	Yes
4020	"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	No
24823	I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	No
13422	The Vice President suggested a number of things.	No
24542	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	No
15705	I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	No
11071	We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	No
31995	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	Yes
27884	...you've had the floor for a while.	No
17157	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	Yes
3687	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	Yes
27538	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
963	They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	No
13229	If you'd pass that message on to him.	No
494	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	No
34981	The auto emission standards were agreed upon by UAW and automobile industry leaders, with collaboration from management to modify them.	Yes
24244	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	No
7778	The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	Yes
35411	The private sector is responsible for creating jobs.	Yes
32137	It's nice to -- one on three.	No
11883	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	No
34575	He stated that the FBI was rigged and concluded that there was no case.	Yes
33594	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	No
1209	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	No
24448	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	No
2830	You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.	No
11738	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	No
33273	Well, I think it's terrible.	No
2063	And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	No
20033	But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	No
24360	So I would be firm.	No
12559	Again we turn to the past.	No
19805	But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	No
16148	I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.	No
12326	It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	Yes
16409	And I will be a good president.	No
32841	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
25033	There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	Yes
35042	None of the six countries has a diplomatic representative representing the United States.	Yes
2208	And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.	Yes
17507	And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
13273	It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	No
35019	It is my opinion that I had 49 percent, while President Ford received 39 percent.	Yes
17819	Many people are predicting a recession.	No
22706	"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	No

25642	We have met young America.	No
15533	And he could do the job.	No
31961	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	No
13636	And we are bleeding arterially.	No
272	But I salute him for his passion.	No
34501	The governor's proposal is based on the Medicare actuaries and it suggests that if you kept the same fee for service as Medicare, your premiums would increase by 18% to 47%.	Yes
13323	Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	No
9509	I want to get America's economy going again.	No
28453	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	No
11079	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	No
12610	We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	No
34814	We've extended Pell Grants to millions of students, including young women, across the nation.	Yes
1266	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	Yes
5789	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	No
6974	It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	No
16288	We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	No
19746	I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	No
35060	The Dorgan Task Force, a bipartisan study, estimated that we could earn approximately $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, and an additional study revealed even more.	Yes
18843	But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	No
19107	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	No
16885	For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	No
7679	What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	No
16137	There are we certainly ought to be able to	No
21762	For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	Yes
8086	They do stand for something.	No
9248	That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	Yes
9448	The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	Yes
29241	Five million people lost their homes.	Yes
17786	Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	No
1788	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	Yes
8219	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	No
28776	There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	No
84	And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	No
1520	If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.	No
1208	The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	Yes
20833	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	No
2198	And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	No
605	I can tell him some I'm against.	No

19436	And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	No
1758	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	No
1935	One, of course, is to raise taxes.	No
19476	And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	Yes
16764	In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	Yes
7267	In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.	No
35514	The Government has taken out millions of acres of public lands that were previously used for exploration of minerals and other resources, in the last year or so.	Yes
35313	In 1987, when President Reagan was still in office, he made a $100,000 advertisement in the New York Times and expressed that we were the world's laughingstock, just like NBC had previously stated.	Yes

26342	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	No
35068	At the beginning of the Korean War, Secretary Acheson gave a well-known speech at the Press Club, indicating that South Korea was beyond the United States' defense perimeter.	Yes
28612	I would like our farmers feeding the world.	No
15294	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	Yes
6492	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	No
8740	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	No
7690	Secondly, as an executive leader.	No
30338	I will go very quickly.	No
17762	It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.	No
1189	I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	No
6693	If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	Yes
719	Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.	No
34819	He recognized the sense of it, but when the Democrat primary arrived, Howard Dean, who opposed war, gained an advantage, leading him to change his position.	Yes
22740	That was the right place.	No
33871	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	No
34865	A massive grain embargo has caused a 20 percent decline in farm exports due to these economic policies.	Yes
4257	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	No
22490	You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	No
26035	I told them in early '95.	No
35856	On the other hand, just 1 percent of the wealthiest individuals in our nation receive 25 percent from all tax reductions.	Yes
6322	And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	No
13493	If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	No
23678	And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	No
15663	And in the process the negatives began.	No
1999	But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.	No
13714	We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	Yes
34877	A study conducted by Princeton University, as per Mr. May, indicates that American cities are currently in worse shape than they were in 1960.	Yes
11708	That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.	Yes
22138	I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	No
18736	On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	No
17477	I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	No
4074	This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.	No
24928	I have ordered an investigation.	Yes
14592	Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	No
12442	Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.	No
16144	He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.	No
2172	That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.	Yes
35652	Russia's actions towards Assad and Iran, which resulted in the most foolish deal in history, were enough to fill this room with money.	Yes
11966	I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	No
34790	The largest deficit ever in our country's history was caused by a $65 billion deficit last year, which was more than what we had during the eight-year period of President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
34561	She speaks in support of the rebels.	Yes
34951	A $2,500 increase in health insurance premiums has been observed.	Yes
7498	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	No
24357	Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	No
5813	And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	No
28874	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	No
33311	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	Yes
23038	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	No
4163	"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	No
22019	I agree with the governor.	No
25195	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	Yes
1170	And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	No
6850	Let me give you a prime example.	No
8063	"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	No
13724	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	No
18447	And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	No
12123	"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."	Yes
2332	Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	No
14532	Well, how about this for a government reform policy?	No
35665	The government is now spending 42 percent of our economy.	Yes
19248	I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.	No
2341	You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	No
13135	They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.	Yes
18365	And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	No
21932	I love my grandchildren --	No
2388	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	Yes
32926	I'm shocked to hear that.	No
22450	And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	No
19653	They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	No
15312	Well, that just isn't true.	No
5660	I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.	Yes
34742	A 40 percent reduction in property crime has been observed.	Yes
18575	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	Yes
13659	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	Yes
31906	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	No
27705	And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	Yes
35477	We dispatched troops to the globe on fifty occasions.	Yes
25538	And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.	No
35161	Our surprise was due to their superior number of submarines and 20 percent more bombers with the ability to carry nuclear missiles than us, which outnumbered them by 64 to 36.	Yes
17242	And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	Yes
185	And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	No
1515	That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	No
29299	Will they create jobs in America?	No
20568	If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.	No
12835	If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	No
12561	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	No
193	So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	No
640	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	No
3607	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	Yes
21003	I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.	No
34772	The fact that tens of thousands of people are locked up in our institutions for crimes or mental illnesses receive disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all their needs and care is disgraceful.	Yes
7606	Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	No
7792	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	No
31846	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	No
1975	And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	Yes
35526	It has come to our attention that this is one of their preferred methods of creating chaos and collecting information.	Yes
883	You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.	No
14713	And it's not tax and spend economics.	No
11743	We've had some disagreements about that.	No
26817	We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	No
30068	She's been doing it a long time.	No
19092	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	No
19591	When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	No
34678	He now joined forces with Iran, whom we had made a very strong allies.	Yes
35261	This is the first time we're bringing Japanese rice from California to our table.	Yes
25940	My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.	Yes
7110	They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	Yes
34267	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	No
13693	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	Yes
26230	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	No
24461	Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	No
24451	I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	No
35606	They are leaving our country to retrieve their money, as they face difficulties in bringing it back due to bureaucratic obstacles and inability to form alliances.	Yes
25480	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	No
8240	It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	No
24367	Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.	Yes
13433	The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.	Yes
2915	And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	No
8582	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	No
29512	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	Yes
12752	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	Yes
9037	Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	No
35361	The Social Security Trust's rate of return is twice the amount that was previously reported.	Yes
24104	I don't think we need to do it.	No
33481	It's pretty clear you won't admit...	No
14932	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	No
34765	She chose not to respond, as Ambassador Stevens...	Yes
6370	And it's great to be with you again.	No
24412	And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.	Yes
8034	And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.	Yes
18914	This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.	No
19580	There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.	Yes
5578	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	No
7906	I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	No
1665	And housing has begun to rise.	Yes
6507	We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	No
15147	But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	Yes
527	Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	No
23628	And I truly respect it.	No
24750	I'm tired of being told we can't.	No
7951	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	No
23527	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	No
35484	The fact of the matter is, we went in alone.	Yes
13410	He's been traveling in some other country.	No
16795	And still he talks about - uh success.	No
35021	The cuts that the president had promised were not included in our budget, and he then doubled the amount.	Yes
25414	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	No
9637	This is what I have done.	No
27410	And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	No
1389	But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	Yes
10267	Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.	Yes
35633	The national debt would reach nearly $20 trillion if the president were to be reelected.	Yes
22156	And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	No
1730	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	Yes
6723	As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	No
34044	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	No
33098	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	No
19450	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	No
24156	We've given away whole industries.	Yes
15096	And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	No
15021	We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.	No
3059	There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.	No
15520	We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	No
35467	The public schools that serve 90% of our children require improvement in their standards and progress through programs like those outlined in this campaign.	Yes
354	A lot of them are mentally sick.	No
16790	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	Yes
16591	We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	No
34928	The president made it clear that he would not increase taxes in New Jersey, but Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesperson, stated within a day that the pledge was not guaranteed.	Yes
20459	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	No
27364	We need to be talking about space.	No
21315	If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	No
33782	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	Yes
7279	I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	Yes
20913	Let me give you another example.	No
35131	My state has been the top performer in job growth, manufacturing, income growth and poverty reduction, ranking 4th in the nation this year.	Yes
17377	Well, again, I'm running on the record.	No
26757	We still have some of that hatred inside us.	No
9389	I'm all for oil production.	No
2756	You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	No
21633	My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.	Yes
35871	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has stated that your proposal will result in the elimination of 700,000 jobs.	Yes
19340	Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.	Yes
32762	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	No
25913	We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.	Yes
6673	They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	No
13539	We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.	No
35837	Fisher House was the recipient of the money that was invested in building homes for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
24955	A President must know these things.	No
30064	We will take out ISIS.	No
20831	Here are the key ingredients.	No
14411	Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	No
12198	That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	Yes
1569	A lot remains to be done.	No
34867	He was denouncing President Reagan.	Yes
35177	The number of Americans without health insurance in this country is five million.	Yes
12602	It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.	Yes
5703	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	Yes
14875	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	No
34785	We have allocated five times the amount that was approved by the previous Administration for Latin America, as well as two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank and a new billion-dollar bank.	Yes
7639	This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.	No
32647	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	No
2365	I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.	No
26533	I think that would help.	No
6320	Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	No
35432	"On the day when I was in the Situation Room, watching the raid that resulted in Osama bin Laden's arrest, he hosted the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	Yes
32446	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	Yes
24323	And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	No
29022	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	No
20448	Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	No
33307	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	Yes
8747	I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	Yes
3654	You've got to look at our records.	No
35595	The health care that is funded by them is government-funded.	Yes
28055	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	No
17446	Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.	No
26309	He won't tell you because he can't.	No
27042	But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	No
4138	I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.	No
16232	I've spelled out my position.	No
32193	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	No
3487	We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	No
11172	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	No
2043	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	No
16554	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	Yes
17149	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	Yes
35377	The way I did this involved significant downsizing of personnel in specific areas.	Yes
35566	The curriculum is being expanded in schools to include forced teaching of math and science, among other subjects.	Yes
19618	Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	No
24283	One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	No
34850	The level of political violence in Haiti is much lower compared to the past.	Yes
35330	It appears that the governor has made several missteps in the last eight years, as if they have not been followed through on any of my previous commitments.	Yes
26255	We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	No
35880	A recent inquiry was conducted on the number of people in Texas who received concealed weapons permits despite having records.	Yes
23040	And we're doing just that.	No
8968	And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	No
35657	They were convicted by a jury.	Yes
35699	After conducting business with Gadhafi, he advocated for the actions we carried out in Libya and demanded his removal.	Yes
34564	We have frozen Medicare and Medicaid, making them a mess.	Yes
15285	There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	Yes
23640	In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	Yes
22653	I would have brought our allies to our side.	No
24103	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	No
6782	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	No
17983	We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	No
21454	Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.	No
32599	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	Yes
35372	We were informed of the danger to our embassy, and we could have either strengthened our security or removed our personnel before the kidnapping and takeover.	Yes
19978	They're having a hard time making ends meet.	No
8068	It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	No
10769	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	No
35881	The annual cost is $20-25 billion, and I am eager to see it reduced.	Yes
12727	The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	No
12541	Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	No
7198	The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	Yes
22002	But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	No
12877	But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	No
35609	The success of Mayor Giuliani's stop and frisk strategy in Chicago was mirrored in New York.	Yes
26066	It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	No
31962	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	Yes
25399	And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.	No
2682	We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	No
35584	At the beginning of the Nixon-Ford Administration, this was 10 percent.	Yes
28865	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	No
393	But that, too, will require some choices.	No
14583	That's what worries me --	No
14390	I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	No
10122	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	No
22025	You have a raging debate about those plans.	No
29691	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	No
20936	Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	No
3872	I was honored to be there.	No
30053	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	No
24777	Let's get on with it.	No
26537	We'd have that trouble all over America.	No
875	I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	No
6669	This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.	Yes
16772	Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.	No
34054	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	No
27929	I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	No
8351	All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	No
20646	And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	No
2654	I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	No
22888	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	No
35598	Iraq alone incurred $200 billion in casualties and expenses, with the majority of it going to healthcare, schools, construction, and prescription drugs for senior citizens.	Yes
29703	We have to work with the police.	No
3500	President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.	No
23636	My opponent voted against the ban.	Yes
9194	If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.	Yes
25537	Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	Yes
10139	And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	No
15940	So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	No
17761	Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	No
12401	And I'm going to try to do better.	No
19044	The military will be an all-volunteer army.	No
35697	The number of children without health insurance in Arizona is 223,000.	Yes
23171	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	No
12116	It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.	No
27276	We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	No
31922	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	No
29954	I don't think you can deny that.	No
17184	It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	No
22935	It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	No
25153	Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	Yes
32895	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	No
16671	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	Yes
8946	And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.	Yes
34620	The affordability of college education has surpassed the ability of many young people, which will help them remain competitive in the market.	Yes
13841	I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	No
19800	We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	No
20935	That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	No
21398	I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	No
17202	In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	No
29913	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	No
35310	Iran has a choice thanks to the work we've done with sanctions.	Yes
29729	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	Yes
28843	You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	No
20120	And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	Yes
13680	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	No
17350	They don't want this arms race.	No
22421	I'm just not going to do that.	No
1181	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	No
17323	Let's take the example that the President cites.	No
26574	But maybe there ought to be more debates.	No
2873	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	Yes
4332	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	No
6905	Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	No
21921	But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	No
3091	But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	No
19933	The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	Yes
15267	I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	Yes
4340	That's going to be critical.	No
35636	During Watergate, an individual who was hired as the bouncer in a bar to gather files by hiring security officers ended up with 900 files, and they were later imprisoned for checking one file and then investigating another file.	Yes
25016	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	No
19152	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	Yes
15649	And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	No
34135	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	No
34364	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	No
16018	Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.	No
3005	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	No
28162	That is a national outrage.	No
30312	It is essential that America's word be good.	No
34604	Even though there is no shortage of dollars, many countries are still swapping against our products.	Yes
20852	And so does Michael Feinberg.	No
13823	And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	No
9438	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	Yes
35768	During my tenure, we were faced with a bureaucratic nightmare similar to the one in Washington today, consisting of 300 agencies, departments, and commissions that were fully funded or partially funded, yet still had conflicting tasks to oversee.	Yes
32985	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	No
20081	The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	No
8002	Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	Yes
32405	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	No
35112	The Duelfer report disclosed their work to us and the entire world yesterday, Mr. President.	Yes
8305	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	No
15382	When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	Yes
34659	I voted in favor of adding 26 years to Medicare's lifespan through a tie-breaking vote.	Yes
15153	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	No
11171	I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	No
34464	The prison labor deal was negotiated with us.	Yes
28557	There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.	Yes
21804	I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.	Yes
3132	Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	Yes
26362	I only have 30 seconds.	No
33632	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	No
30112	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	No
22679	And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	No
7235	And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	No
15766	I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	No
23177	We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	Yes
6148	You all just heard my plan.	No
4284	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	No
20981	I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	No
28665	I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	No
381	We went out and built housing.	No
24379	And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	No
34822	It's worth noting that during my presidency, I vetoed fifty-six bills in the two years that followed.	Yes
1297	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	Yes
28185	It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	No
23482	As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.	No
25139	I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	Yes
35332	I was faced with a T trillion deficit upon entering the Oval Office.	Yes
7897	And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	No
18364	And I honor their sacrifices.	No
1463	Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	No
8155	I think we can do a better job.	No
17099	And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.	No
27627	So our troops will come home at that point.	Yes
4353	We seem to come full circle again.	No
6170	And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	No
25531	But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.	No
16245	So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	No
20741	I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	No
14603	We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	Yes
10124	So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	No
26924	Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	No
13921	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	Yes
2241	One last point I want to make.	No
29155	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	No
32932	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	Yes
15857	Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	No
30421	I was going to say something...	No
14037	I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.	No
8148	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	No
12380	And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	No
32774	I would go after Baghdadi.	No
24807	There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.	No
1567	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	No
6271	Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	Yes
25325	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	No
11328	I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	No
29989	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	Yes
30119	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	Yes
34795	The number of manufacturing jobs lost has reached 357,000.	Yes
23248	And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	Yes
26391	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	No
20720	We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	No
598	And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	No
34428	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	No
13508	Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	No
17765	Whose taxes will you raise?	No
34920	July twelfth of this year, we granted full permission for the publication of that report.	Yes
35789	For the first time in six years, California surpassed the national average in inflation and unemployment.	Yes
25989	Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	No
4115	"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	No
26655	We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	Yes
32241	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	No
11559	It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.	No
2602	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	No
29377	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	No
3556	I will make them famous.	No
6865	Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	No
35358	The Treasury has imposed an increased tax burden on farmers, resulting in the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
9809	He hasn't done that either.	No
23001	This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	No
25123	But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	Yes
33404	We either have a border or we don't.	No
2460	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	Yes
35669	The idea of reducing taxes for the wealthy has not been successful.	Yes
35096	Through the United Nations, we initiated diplomatic protests against the Cambodian government.	Yes
22052	I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	No
6836	That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	No
20409	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	No
35054	The first half of 1984 has seen an 81/2 percent increase.	Yes
3001	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	Yes
24793	We've got to change the system.	No
18660	We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	No
24344	But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	No
23175	Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	Yes
20091	He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	No
25864	What service are you in?	No
2480	These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	No
4357	All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.	No
9246	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	No
19424	But it seems to me the record is clear.	No
35329	He asserted that he was unfairly favored in the Republican primary.	Yes
16177	I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	No
34420	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	No
14809	I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	No
34685	Recently, there have been allegations that I had a covert plan with the hostages.	Yes
25219	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.	Yes
817	A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.	Yes
33233	So I'm very honored by all of that.	No
13124	"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	Yes
7421	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	No
1855	And I think that would be a mistake.	No
610	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	No
18550	Now that's what we have to do.	No
13382	And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	Yes
20122	There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	Yes
29634	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	No
20993	On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	No
7895	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	No
35137	Currently, I come across youths throughout the nation who have either chosen to avoid college or are burdened with debt of $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, and $60,000, making it difficult for them to pursue careers in basic science research.	Yes
22773	And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	No
6099	You won't pay a fine, because...	No
16803	There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.	Yes
1980	Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.	No
25828	But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	No
15023	We also are pursuing housing programs.	No
15458	All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.	No
17272	First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	No
5568	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	Yes
22424	I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	No
28135	We want them to continue that.	No
35216	As per my proposal, a crime bill was passed that would have stationed 100,000 police officers on the streets, banned assault weapons, and addressed issues related to capital punishment, including drug trafficking.	Yes
17394	I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	Yes
15943	And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	No
35196	If someone is caught with marijuanaweighing less than 125 pounds while living in San Diego, they may be compelled to return to Mexico, according to Mr. President.	Yes
15625	Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	Yes
12705	The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.	No
35770	She lied during the last debate because she claimed to have never mentioned the gold standard, as hinted.	Yes
26200	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	No
35053	Our country is the richest in the world, and we are the only industrialized nation that didn't do it.	Yes
14419	In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	Yes
8066	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	No
1320	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	No
29668	I'll give you an example.	No
17275	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	No
25719	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.	No
12450	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	No
6478	Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.	No
15263	As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.	Yes
15833	And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	No
22036	See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.	Yes
35013	We're sending 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
7804	We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	No
2013	That doesn't get the job done.	No
30198	I know how to win.	No
24810	And then I think of the older people who are retired.	No
33094	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	No
12891	This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	No
19818	I've reached out to people all my life.	No
29825	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	No
34212	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	No
28767	I think it's the tone.	No
11400	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	No
8213	A record is never something to stand on.	No
15523	And so I have great confidence in him.	No
26682	There are American jobs that are being lost.	No
35424	It's not the right time to separate from a country that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on track to double them in the future, while also facing significant danger from terrorist groups within its own territory, as I previously mentioned, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	Yes
1785	And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	No
23609	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	No
7061	I see it as a serious problem.	No
1305	And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	No
35756	He suffered a loss of 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
20465	This is a major problem facing America.	No
30404	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	Yes
11160	So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.	No
28571	They're aimed at the real problem.	No
34820	Doctors are recommending treatments through prescription, but HMOs and insurance companies are overstating their recommendations.	Yes
34804	An 87 percent increase in medical expenses during the Carter-Mondale administration may have contributed to the problem.	Yes
3207	So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	No
21486	I don't want to --	No
16059	And I'm very proud of it.	No
8485	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	No
23140	Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.	Yes
14148	He got a notice or he didn't.	No
35563	It's important to keep in mind that we have been negotiating for several months to get tests checked and come to an agreement.	Yes
34792	Despite mimicking and mocking the reporter on national television while our children were watching, he never apologized to them.	Yes
15016	When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	No
3766	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	No
1256	We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	Yes
27083	But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	No
14887	Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	No
5826	We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	No
33274	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	Yes
6579	We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.	No
16619	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	Yes
32566	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	No
27411	And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	No
23098	He wanted to give people rights.	No
6618	We talk about fiscal matters.	No
34966	In this country, there are hundreds of thousands of people who rely on public assistance.	Yes
13106	I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	Yes
18745	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	No
35819	A typical example, similar to many others, is the overthrow of an elected government and the establishment of a military dictatorship by this administration.	Yes
33040	They'll pay off our national debt.	No
6562	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	No
6464	Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.	Yes
35532	The government charges $7,700 per family for the cost.	Yes
35441	Senator Dole and his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, have argued that the $550 billion tax plan is too risky and requires cutting Medicare and Social Security to avoid it.	Yes
12961	And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	No
12735	Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	No
7283	And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	Yes
15193	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	No
27241	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	No
21347	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	No
1013	Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.	No
28134	They discover great new cures and that's great.	No
10660	My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	No
460	And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	No
1662	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	No
23452	I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.	No
23635	It's one way to help reduce abortions.	No
2875	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	Yes
27855	This is a company, this isn't basic research.	No
27076	And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	Yes
21717	I am not for national registration of firearms.	Yes
15069	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	Yes
21013	And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	No
35820	I believe that the reduction in expenses will be more understandable to many of our citizens who examine the events surrounding the Truman Administration's overspending and the erosion of savings due to inflation.	Yes
13366	Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	Yes
19915	I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	No
2744	I'll get incomes up again.	No
30247	It's not an accurate one.	No
1111	I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	Yes
12060	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	No
7327	It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	No
23148	That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.	No
21555	I make those charts you see on television.	No
35158	In that situation, I believe they would not force us down as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
25168	"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	No
20810	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	Yes
34597	He fails to remember that he opposed or was recorded against an amendment during the debate on the Formosa resolution, which resulted in its passage through the Senate by seventy-to-one votes.	Yes
8623	I think we're ready to move.	No
8589	But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.	No
15272	the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	Yes
5775	And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	Yes
700	We know where they're cutting.	No
12833	Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	No
34934	I don't think that's too extreme; however, the House of Representatives saw a vote of almost two-thirds to three-quarters against the proposal.	Yes
6578	I'm going to change that.	No
22440	Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	No
28791	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	No
13130	Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	Yes
14389	This goes on night and day.	No
1027	Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.	Yes
34990	In November 1975, Governor Carter proposed a $15 billion reduction in the defense budget.	Yes
24591	I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.	No
21817	I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	No
20736	I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	No
11754	I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	No
26628	Now none of that will happen anymore.	No
34900	There are 11 million people who lack documentation in our country.	Yes
13481	Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	No
32520	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	Yes
19623	We have to be firm and strong.	No
14950	I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.	No
29042	You ain't seen nothing yet.	No
35764	Senator Dole opposed student loan programs, voted against Headstart and opposed the creation of the Department of Education.	Yes
34721	The outcome has not been disclosed, including whether it will be deemed addictive.	Yes
3967	I can see how tough that terrain is.	No
2305	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	No
17028	It was a superb occasion.	No
16667	But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	No
360	And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	No
30046	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	No
20787	As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	Yes
25623	The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.	No
35728	It is known that he committed to building a coalition for the United States.	Yes
8914	Well, we've seen what has happened.	No
34338	So we have to use our great people.	No
25043	He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.	Yes
32818	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	Yes
2877	Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	No
3829	And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	No
35260	The European Community is now capable of paying a significantly higher amount than before.	Yes
35082	Taking into account the number of individuals who left the workforce, the unemployment rate could be computed at 10.7 percent.	Yes
11840	I think these crimes are different.	No
12814	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	Yes
22269	That's the only way we got him back.	No
2564	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	No
32475	And she never will change.	No
13299	I disapprove of the issue.	No
26818	But beyond that we need to address the economy.	No
20007	Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	Yes
23295	That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	Yes
35363	During my grade school, my best friend, who is now a computer software salesman, shared with me that it took him nine months to transfer his 401K plan from one job to another.	Yes
2452	And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.	No
2977	He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.	No
21614	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	No
33191	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	No
35219	Governor Romney's definition of a small business is that it includes millionaires and billionaires.	Yes
34623	I never suggested that Medicare receive a $20 billion budget, but I recommended that the program be addressed with this specific issue.	Yes
34533	He acknowledges that the administration has been conducting business with Noriega.	Yes
3224	On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	Yes
8463	Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.	Yes
4090	Now here's what we need to do.	No
13033	See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	No
12173	So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	No
12247	We have a very different outlook.	No
32723	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	No
17910	That's not fair for our future.	No
24647	Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	Yes
3357	Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	Yes
35841	The federal government provides community development funds to cities, amounting to approximately three billion three hundred million dollars.	Yes
13166	It's a question of who they are.	No
8713	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.	Yes
16492	So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.	No
18197	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	Yes
24351	I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	No
12884	And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	No
3873	I was honored to speak to those troops.	No
8047	I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	No
35802	The number of people and children required for cover is approximately 20 million.	Yes
2748	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	No
12395	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	Yes
34926	Our country has a 3 percent share of the world's oil reserves and uses 25% of it, but Senator McCain emphasizes the importance of drilling.	Yes
7042	And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	Yes
5549	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	No
24355	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	No
35124	He was informed by General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, that he would require several hundred thousand.	Yes
18610	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	No
33375	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	Yes
35335	ISIS is being taken down by Iran.	Yes
171	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.	No
25382	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	No
25892	I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	Yes
27450	It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	Yes
22195	The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	No
10721	We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	No
74	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
15673	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	No
12041	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	Yes
28987	And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	Yes
12059	It's really a matter of culture.	No
24335	I mean, that's been done.	Yes
35847	The discretionary domestic budget has undergone its largest reduction since Dwight Eisenhower.	Yes
7435	But Washington is a tough town.	No
25576	And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.	No
23728	I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.	No
3565	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	Yes
7085	If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	No
4103	Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	No
21401	We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	Yes
35604	I have been advocating for criminal justice reform since the beginning of my campaign.	Yes
24583	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	No
20160	And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.	No
96	Panama is a friendly country.	No
15589	There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	No
13515	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	Yes
25291	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	No
21842	People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.	No
533	But it takes presidential leadership.	No
6719	You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
11919	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	No
25214	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	Yes
14845	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	No
12077	But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.	No
13865	Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	No
18641	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	No
24617	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	No
22998	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	No
7848	Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.	Yes
7917	That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	No
19352	And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	No
28373	And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	Yes
35190	Taxes on the most affluent Americans have been significantly reduced, despite an increase in their income.	Yes
33591	I want us to do more to help small business.	No
14745	This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	No
29666	And that's what I do.	No
28404	If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.	No
14963	In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	Yes
26403	We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	No
13542	In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	No
708	We're not making those choices.	No
10271	The problem is they'll be in china.	No
21367	But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	No
24698	Costs will continue to spiral.	No
461	And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	No
29658	I built an unbelievable company.	No
11106	They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	Yes
13225	They may - are not my style.	No
17384	We have, to one-third of what it was.	Yes
10158	For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	No
34972	In 1959, he repeated the same mistake in his speech.	Yes
15435	And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	No
25228	Different people with different views fight with each other.	No
17009	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	No
10266	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	No
20342	Let me give you one quick example.	No
26149	You should expect that from both of us.	No
25421	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	No
34247	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	Yes
18467	I don't think he was misleading.	No
2801	We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	No
12852	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	No
29020	Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.	No
8592	Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	No
1345	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	No
21148	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	No
1593	The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	Yes
427	It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.	Yes
22270	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	No
2728	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	No
29164	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	No
14565	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
35637	I have a plan to allocate $20 billion every year for the next four years to support new transportation, communication, environmental clean-ups, and innovative technologies in the 21st century.	Yes
34399	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	No
13267	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	Yes
15494	We've had great success in my own state.	No
35559	The Administration was the first significant nation to resist abuse in Tiananmen Square.	Yes
34478	Every farmer is aware that net farm income has decreased by 50 percent in the last 3 years.	Yes
14404	I said well, this is simple.	No
17975	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	No
30231	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
19197	One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	No
32129	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	No
17432	The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.	Yes
34175	We need to go after the leadership.	No
29963	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	No
33227	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	No
34554	While campaigning in North Pittsburgh, I observed that the city's water mains had started leaking and there was no money available to fix the leakage.	Yes
27467	I would indict him for it.	No
21559	I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	No
10324	Government does not create jobs.	No
29058	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	No
17226	[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.	Yes
33324	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	No
34482	Despite the ongoing meetings, he ultimately supported the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, which was one of the most tragic and misguided foreign policy decisions in our country and encouraged hostage-buying.	Yes
19702	We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
20823	Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	No
21782	I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	No
27970	I want to see growing peace in this country.	No
19582	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	Yes
32852	This is the only one country he's ever known.	No
35734	"Helen, I think that people are more likely to ask questions about trust when they observe Governor Clinton's tendency to use the word ""trust"" as a way of appeasing one group and then try to appease another group."	Yes
62	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	No
15307	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	No
94	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	Yes
911	And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	Yes
18590	When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	No
33644	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	Yes
33388	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	No
34720	I declared my commitment to ensuring the safety of women who take the drug.	Yes
22314	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.	Yes
15176	First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	No
16568	I do not agree with that point of view.	No
6980	Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.	No
13878	That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	No
16038	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	No
23166	I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	No
32989	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	No
11746	And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	No
12364	We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	No
1253	That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.	Yes
33101	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	No
28691	I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.	No
34128	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	No
21496	Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.	Yes
389	But governors are ready; mayors are ready.	No
31872	And this is happening on a weekly basis.	No
1740	This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	No
12590	I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	No
20566	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
15776	And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	No
265	"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	No
14252	And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	Yes
24963	I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	No
20904	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	No
17039	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	No
11553	And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	No
35384	Even though he speaks about No Child Left Behind, the president refused to invest $28 billion in the program to aid young people.	Yes
13915	I do understand creating jobs.	No
785	Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	No
20931	You don't test every year.	No
19816	So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	No
4191	They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	No
8854	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	Yes
16868	My average in two years is twenty-six.	Yes
18652	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	Yes
16624	In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	Yes
35027	We refrained from raising sales taxes, income tax, or property tax.	Yes
16791	I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.	No
8115	But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	No
34786	I've outlined a comprehensive plan for clamping down on crime at home and overseas, increasing the number of drug enforcement officers, holding upcoming hemispheric summits with democratic neighbors and allies after January 20th to work together.	Yes
9053	That we must cut back.	No
8762	Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	No
35280	If the majority of middle-class individuals were accurate, the tax cuts offered to them would be lower than the one provided to the wealthiest 1% under his proposal.	Yes
33693	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	Yes
3012	Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	No
19458	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	Yes
25958	Cocaine use up 160 percent.	Yes
19748	Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	No
20553	It's very clear to me.	No
17095	We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	Yes
29287	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	No
29964	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	No
27539	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
7765	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	Yes
29796	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	No
29725	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	Yes
2509	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	No
25341	And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	No
33412	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	Yes
35656	For several weeks, Donald resorted to insulting and attacking them for their religious beliefs.	Yes
22981	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
25380	We'll even give it to you.	No
7652	Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	No
7726	Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	Yes
13421	But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	No
35094	The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines in Korea had a combined number of 3 million five hundred thousand young men.	Yes
34858	My proposal to the Congress, given a budget ceiling of 395 billion dollars, resulted in an additional $25 billion in tax reduction.	Yes
3264	I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	No
34815	The fact that I was re-elected in New York by a much larger margin than my first attempt made me extremely proud.	Yes
10734	I believe in the need for increased oil production.	No
34830	The repeal of Obamacare is expected to result in the loss of health insurance for approximately 50 million individuals.	Yes
30073	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	No
24570	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	No
28387	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	No
14430	And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	Yes
3176	So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	No
2315	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	No
9514	We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	Yes
8733	possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	Yes
3182	Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	No
13137	This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	No
11770	The governor mentioned it earlier.	No
27481	And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	No
13152	Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	Yes
18986	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	Yes
8218	I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	No
29516	You know what that is?	No
873	I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	No
19447	We need to do this together and we can.	No
35743	I had to veto two civil rights quota bills because I don't support the notion of limiting people's participation in government or higher education.	Yes
10259	I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	No
35318	We distributed $5.7 billion to the California residents through tax rebates, tax credits, and tax cuts.	Yes
34529	When a presidential candidate repeatedly declares the United States as second in space, Senator Kennedy has seen us score twenty-eight successful shots and fall short in education.	Yes
24260	I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	No
17579	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	Yes
25775	They were presidents at historic times.	No
34113	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	No
11013	And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	No
26805	We should have more debates.	No
22272	It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	No
14962	This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.	No
19419	I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	No
33575	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	No
21095	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.	No
27464	Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	No
1052	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	No
34194	If they did it by surprise...	No
14476	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	No
25388	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	No
27703	Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	No
19994	And not about personal things.	No
25701	And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	No
31990	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	Yes
26174	Of course the president will take credit for that.	No
21598	Everybody's running against the incumbent.	No
1921	It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.	Yes
21728	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	Yes
4172	Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	No
20657	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
16902	We will make some gains in the United States Senate.	No
26616	So we need to preserve the system.	No
840	And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	No
19413	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	Yes
6696	A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	Yes
23708	That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	No
35577	Our progress had reached the point where the Lebanese Government had organized meetings in Geneva to negotiate a peace agreement with the hostile factions.	Yes
682	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.	No
22007	But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	No
18968	And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	No
23199	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	Yes
23772	We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.	No
10954	Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	Yes
8702	their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	Yes
1886	That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	No
35434	A man I hold in high esteem, Congressman John Lewis, made an accusation last night that Sarah Palin and I were connected to the worst chapter of American history, which was segregation and church bombings.	Yes
32111	What about the other 15,000?	No
472	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	No
8151	Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.	Yes
7786	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	No
27692	We haven't done that yet.	No
15321	I'd like to change that.	No
30076	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
15846	It's gotten a little nasty.	No
25167	We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	No
27678	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	No
3915	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
29461	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	No
31993	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	No
8163	I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	No
11304	And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	No
14953	Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.	Yes
19297	I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	No
15991	The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	No
34414	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	No
35168	I am aware that my opposition to air pollution laws in California is widely accepted, but the President may be advocating for a law that the Federal Government attempted to enforce that would prevent individuals from driving vehicles within or outside of city limits.	Yes
6911	I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	No
19244	In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	No
27287	And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	No
8280	You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	No
11446	So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	No
6097	And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.	No
35324	It's a good question, Sander, and the answer is that we were peaceful for 40 or so years.	Yes
23894	So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	No
17575	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	No
26922	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	Yes
20144	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	No
16684	I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	Yes
13522	A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.	Yes
34666	I was at the forefront of the campaign to impose 100,000 police officers on American roads.	Yes
11989	So I favor closing the gun show loophole.	No
24829	Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	No
162	So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	No
2507	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	No
3036	It's for their security as well as ours.	No
34788	The announcement made this week indicates that the annual rate of constructing new houses will be around one million, eight hundred and several thousand, which is a significant increase from last year and notably from the earlier part of this year.	Yes
35022	Within a span of eight years, the federal government's contribution to education has been reduced by 30 percent.	Yes
7193	But let me go a step further.	No
15109	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	No
14754	"The ""we"" is you and me."	No
25683	I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	No
1763	But not due to his policies.	No
35317	We formed a historic alliance, defeated him, and eliminated the fourth largest army.	Yes
34882	As a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	Yes
3602	But let's go back to the original point.	No
27266	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	Yes
28697	And so I don't support censorship.	No
8690	We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	Yes
5945	That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	No
1512	Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	No
34466	I must have had a different experience than the vice president because this administration has cut programs for children, nutrition, and other areas that can help young people lead healthier lives.	Yes
8027	I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	No
30216	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	Yes
34131	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	Yes
13935	Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	No
34855	It has been four years, but we are now closer to achieving a nuclear Iran.	Yes
33662	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	Yes
29562	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	No
20662	If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	No
34637	He expressed that if a nuclear war were to break out in East Asia, it would be acceptable...	Yes
14648	It doesn't work that way when you're president.	No
4130	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	Yes
6333	By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	Yes
33	And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	No
17615	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	Yes
6510	No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	No
14750	Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.	No
22305	Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.	Yes
19350	That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.	No
1678	I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	No
28392	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	Yes
15809	I agree with the Governor on athletics.	No
7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	No
35564	You cast your vote for tax hikes on 98 occasions.	Yes
11063	If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	No
7849	Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	No
32936	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
4173	We do that all the time.	No
21850	That means keep government out of it.	No
29847	Look, one murder is too many.	No
28631	The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	No
19250	He doesn't fix it for ten years.	Yes
27870	And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	No
28721	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	No
23204	We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	Yes
3231	This has not been an ancient history story.	No
8923	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	No
20504	I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	No
19687	I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	No
20110	Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.	Yes
25955	You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	No
19670	I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	Yes
15501	You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	No
18071	The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	No
11200	It is the same overall strategy.	No
565	But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.	No
4145	The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	No
17582	And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.	Yes
8871	Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	Yes
27256	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	Yes
9717	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	No
35844	"The ""Los Angeles Times"" has reported that the budget I've published will result in government spending being a zero percent reduction from GDP, marking the lowest level in 50 years."	Yes
13831	I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.	Yes
11055	And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.	Yes
19833	It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	No
16821	Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
12316	I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	Yes
21364	So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	No
6635	This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	Yes
1404	And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.	No
27218	I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	No
33872	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	Yes
12976	I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	No
27812	Nothing could be further from the truth.	No
920	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	No
26300	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	Yes
34768	The majority of the tax reductions were directed towards low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
19807	But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	No
35869	He tallied 98 votes for tax hikes.	Yes
34232	Take a look at it.	No
12139	It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	No
25916	I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.	No
13772	I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	Yes
28296	It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	Yes
8900	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	Yes
22611	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	No
10569	But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	No
32308	So he would have been alive today.	No
30367	You have -- wait a minute.	No
29848	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	No
29122	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	No
2815	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	No
26092	$500 per child under 18.	Yes
16679	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	No
23456	Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	Yes
12622	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	No
7953	I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	No
19861	And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.	Yes
2232	And private insurers have to make a profit.	No
1579	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	Yes
35117	Until at least the third decade of the next century, Social Security remains unchanged, as you pointed out.	Yes
474	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	No
20206	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	No
6786	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	Yes
20170	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	No
29220	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	No
1155	This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	No
12845	He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	No
11995	Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	Yes
4230	So, this is a very difficult situation.	No
23961	Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.	Yes
34416	Your husband disagrees with you.	No
6622	They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	No
33600	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	No
1349	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	No
19868	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	Yes
26944	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	No
13501	Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	Yes
14970	The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	Yes
34474	The situation concerning steel and the cost of steel, coupled with China's dumping of significant amounts of it throughout the United States, is having devastating consequences for our steelworkers and companies.	Yes
1781	Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	Yes
34548	In a remarkable move, 10 individuals who have had that great responsibility have expressed their disbelief in Donald Trump's ability to control the nuclear codes or pressurize the button.	Yes
18195	Anyway, that's for another debate.	No
25014	I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.	No
7010	The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	Yes
5551	Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	Yes
2074	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	No
16443	Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	No
8444	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	Yes
22372	A message just won't do it.	No
35370	Despite some reservations by teachers unions, I increased the number of charter schools in Illinois by two-fold.	Yes
21378	Here's some thing that'll help.	No
14940	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.	Yes
25563	Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	No
35033	During the president's invasion, thirty-five to forty countries in the world were more proficient at producing weapons than Saddam Hussein.	Yes
3802	And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	No
8538	The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	No
35485	The crime rate in Houston has decreased by 15 percent in the last year due to the mayor's efforts to increase the police force.	Yes
273	We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	No
28421	You talk about eight years?	No
22183	We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	No
6205	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	No
16094	And I have made some good sound proposals.	No
14469	These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.	No
25711	We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	Yes
26466	That would be my answer to this question.	No
19558	We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	No
7593	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	No
24187	The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	No
19646	We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.	No
19904	I feel strongly about education.	No
2174	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	Yes
8797	As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	Yes
3341	One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	Yes
33744	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	Yes
3297	And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	No
14089	And we're in real trouble on that.	No
21488	I get wound up because I feel strongly --	No
1049	I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	Yes
14700	First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	No
6574	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	Yes
8664	Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	Yes
27628	I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	No
32306	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	Yes
7645	And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	No
28317	The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.	Yes
3033	In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	Yes
14388	So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	No
32166	But we've got to get costs down.	No
19208	The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	Yes
21263	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	No
7972	In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	Yes
16809	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	Yes
34340	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	No
13703	So we've got to do that.	No
35400	The President's economic strategy calls for raising taxes to the extent that it will allow us to take away a significant amount of money from the public and balance the budget in that manner.	Yes
491	I think it is good.	No
9047	And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	No
16516	If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.	Yes
11238	Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	No
17967	But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	No
35284	The current facilities we're arranging for veterans to live in are being aligned.	Yes
26942	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	No
30210	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	Yes
17601	With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.	No
1493	As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	Yes
32977	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	No
8223	We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.	No
32009	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	Yes
17130	Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	No
13397	It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.	No
14747	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	No
34753	My opposition is due to their apprehension that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who pay the highest rates, which they fear.	Yes
434	The question is who makes the decision.	No
6321	And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	No
3941	And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.	No
17005	I don't claim to know all the answers.	No
26932	But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	No
28050	I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	No
9734	And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	No
444	And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	No
23709	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	Yes
11530	I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	No
2128	You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.	No
8614	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
32158	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	No
13004	It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.	No
23785	We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	No
19499	Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	No
22712	He came to see me.	No
16888	We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	Yes
28085	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	No
12261	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	No
1542	What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.	No
34692	The economy is still experiencing a slowdown in growth.	Yes
13959	And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	No
7502	We can lift our schools up.	No
8574	Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.	Yes
16208	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	Yes
4341	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	No
19953	Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.	Yes
16994	For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.	No
13282	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
24221	Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	No
35041	The President dispatched a team, headed by Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to convince Chiang Kai-shek to retreat from the two islands in the spring of fifty-five due to their vulnerability.	Yes
20838	They went to Austin High School.	No
19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	No
24774	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	No
32011	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	Yes
13007	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	No
22160	I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	No
35502	By nineteen sixty-one, two and three, they will be ahead of us in terms of missiles.	Yes
9041	Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.	No
26004	Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	Yes
24637	And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.	No
35498	The economy has been under the control of the president, resulting in the loss of 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
199	But, George, that's no answer.	No
27788	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	No
34630	Employers who are below 50 years old are not included.	Yes
35684	In my travels, I've come across countries where the governments have either enforced abortions or encouraged childbirth, similar to China and Romania.	Yes
17534	It's been a big failure.	No
14398	Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.	No
10251	The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.	Yes
25757	I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	No
27179	Our military is second to none in the world.	Yes
7651	And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	Yes
2724	And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.	No
29817	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	No
35830	Five million people were displaced from their homes.	Yes
21714	I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	No
34362	It may be because of our experiences.	No
29282	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	Yes
28111	So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	No
6748	And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	Yes
11363	I believe in its greatness.	No
35816	The NAACP has not been in touch with this president, making him the first president to do so.	Yes
20118	He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	No
30363	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	Yes
24327	National security, economic strength, democracy.	No
16064	And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	No
18078	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	No
7940	That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	No
23380	I'm going to be a president who believes in science.	No
17600	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	No
20115	Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	No
14418	But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	No
14771	To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	No
528	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	Yes
27530	So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	No
5810	That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.	No
12965	Why didn't we bring students over here?	No
4077	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	No
1030	The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	No
26503	And I think right now we got to go back.	No
2487	That's the wrong way to go.	No
163	And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	No
538	This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	No
23659	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	No
19279	So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	No
810	25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	No
25295	And one of those dreams is justice.	No
25786	We don't talk about it.	No
35630	One million barrels have been imported from Saddam Hussein by us today.	Yes
35152	The view held by Governor Romney is that we can achieve better results by cutting taxes, favoring the wealthy, and reducing regulations.	Yes
6659	"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	No
13005	It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	No
29317	And I have been a secretary of state...	No
24309	Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	No
11220	I said before, watch Ukraine.	No
11202	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	No
26292	The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	Yes
22280	Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	No
6342	Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.	No
35285	The issue is whether your priorities are in line with the current policy that has been imposed by lobbyists and special interest groups in Washington.	Yes
21085	You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.	No
24699	And just remember this, folks.	No
10757	That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.	No
28447	It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.	No
9291	Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	Yes
35671	Despite some initial clashes in the Senate committees, the Treaty has never been brought to the floor for debate or vote.	Yes
19260	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	Yes
235	Well, we're on the right track.	No
27599	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	No
9709	I came through small business.	No
27166	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	No
21238	I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	No
24297	It's a very unstable situation.	No
32944	We are back on the right track.	No
17817	Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	Yes
25351	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	Yes
26061	You can be on welfare.	No
16317	I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	No
30088	How do we protect our people?	No
29048	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	No
6316	It's not going to happen on its own.	No
23385	And I just told you the facts, sir.	No
17122	We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	Yes
14569	And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	Yes
29240	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	Yes
4044	You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	No
8039	It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	No
9986	His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.	Yes
24985	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	No
10053	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	No
26052	And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	No
23144	You know what it is?	No
34936	The John's lack of experience in executive positions is not entirely apparent.	Yes
24034	Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	No
17349	The American people want arms control.	No
683	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	No
11027	But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	No
6549	That costs the government $7,700 per family.	Yes
13015	Not one of them selected a Communist government.	Yes
23105	And you'll find a tort reform plan.	No
11082	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	No
15375	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	No
21029	They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	No
20851	What I care about is children.	No
35401	The growth rate exceeded the Federal Government's spending, and it was more than doubled.	Yes
21725	We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	No
4273	And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	No
13254	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	No
35197	During my two terms as the president of the United States, I have averaged more than one meeting per month with both House and Senate committees.	Yes
21254	And we have a very important decision to make.	No
188	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	No
1572	I served an a hospital authority.	No
30012	I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
27698	Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	No
34649	Nonetheless, it constitutes less than 1 percent of the total cost of healthcare.	Yes
8362	There's no certain road to the presidency.	No
13253	I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	No
415	I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.	No
24384	They didn't go over to coddle.	No
8070	The people have to make up their minds.	No
24242	Give me a chance to do that.	No
12800	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	No
28685	Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.	No
3008	These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	No
10872	And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.	No
21845	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	No
784	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	No
29479	... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	No
17142	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	No
26410	That's what we will do.	No
14010	Or do you just keep lunging in at will?	No
15894	We took the child to New York.	No
8920	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	Yes
15178	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	Yes
20023	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	No
34475	It is widely known that he mentioned the non-existence of nuclear materials in his state of the union message to Congress.	Yes
16582	But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	No
4007	Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	Yes
17656	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	Yes
35235	There is no reason for Americans to die, as Afghans are capable of defending their own country.	Yes
1881	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
30109	They were choking on the sanctions.	No
6529	It's not working for the American family.	No
14847	In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	Yes
35349	A number of government agencies were aware that he was prioritizing military aid over developing weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
22198	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	No
19957	Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.	No
3210	He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	Yes
27065	And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	No
11751	Well, I mentioned Third World debt.	No
12315	China and India were exempted from that treaty.	Yes
27916	That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	No
34870	A person who earns income in the range of 10, 15, and 20 is subject to paying taxes on their total gross earnings, even though they have already paid income tax on that sum.	Yes
25065	Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	No
5888	If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	No
2329	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	No
34486	Our agreement with Latin America, which included the establishment of the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, is one of five treaties that we have committed to not intervening in the internal affairs of any other American country, and they have also agreed to do the same.	Yes
24125	I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.	No
12273	People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.	No
26521	How many of you like it?	No
28407	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	No
18517	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	No
9217	And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	No
30169	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	Yes
29223	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	Yes
17123	It was $200 billion deficit instead.	Yes
17584	Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	No
12691	Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.	No
859	I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.	No
6070	Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.	Yes
1249	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	No
33285	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	No
9603	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	No
17730	It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.	Yes
34898	I have an average of twenty-six points in two years.	Yes
26716	Why should they be rifling through your files?	No
16134	So that's not where we ought to go.	No
18697	Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	No
3988	And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	No
18819	I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	No
3567	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	No
746	We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	No
34528	We eliminated the middleman part of the student loan program by taking $60 billion from banks and lenders.	Yes
24905	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	Yes
7671	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	No
35035	I plan to allocate 1.6 trillion dollars towards defense until 2002, with a budget gap of less than 1 percent between my and the Republican budget.	Yes
33090	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	No
21852	It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.	No
13146	Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	No
22885	The all- volunteer army works.	No
14626	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	No
25011	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	No
32494	And that's, like, no growth.	No
26417	We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.	Yes
1666	But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.	No
12212	We're working hard to sign up children.	No
13368	So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.	No
25497	And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	No
15304	As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.	No
12577	Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.	Yes
35184	As poverty levels rise, the number of people who are eligible for a roll (i.e.	Yes
28517	Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	No
19982	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	No
13203	Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.	Yes
34904	A board that can inform individuals of their treatment options was not established.	Yes
18746	If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	No
19674	There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.	No
8388	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	Yes
4170	And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.	No
12138	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	Yes
1759	And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.	No
1552	We have peace with freedom.	No
11447	But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	No
33417	We will not have open borders.	No
25069	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	No
15756	That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.	No
35709	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills per year as Mr, Nixon did.	Yes
5837	And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	No
20462	We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.	No
1747	Middle-income families are being crushed.	No
12248	And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	No
2847	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.	Yes
15363	Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	No
20151	And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.	No
28809	So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	No
35374	The increase in people's work has resulted in a decrease in personal income.	Yes
34465	I have recommended that the president be provided with additional weapons to safeguard the national interest in the event of national emergency strikes beyond the Taft-Hartley Act's injunction provision.	Yes
26335	Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	Yes
9625	But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	No
22729	I know how these people think.	No
18464	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	No
18526	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	No
17813	This administration seems to run that every morning.	No
16331	Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.	No
23830	But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	No
13109	This is the history of dealing with dictators.	No
35252	Under this leadership, new business has reached its lowest point in 30 years.	Yes
645	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	No
12051	Let me say something about Columbine.	No
907	Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.	No
29036	I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.	No
29990	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	Yes
6522	I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.	No
23549	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	Yes
21359	Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.	Yes
24505	And he went out and he did it.	No
25074	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	No
24317	We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	No
35144	Medicare will cover all expenses, imposes a $25 premium, and offers benefits that are unattainable in the private sector, particularly for those living in families with low income or with high costs.	Yes
35283	We are the ones lowering the barrier to products through Carla Hill's negotiation.	Yes
8529	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	No
13741	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	No
33381	We either have -- and by the way...	No
31847	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	No
13327	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	No
2535	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	No
128	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	No
16379	Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	No
14264	And I just had to work that in.	No
7833	So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	No
33892	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	No
28833	This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	No
22730	I meet with them all the time.	No
7194	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	No
16334	His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.	Yes
2990	I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.	No
7663	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	No
9939	Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	No
3014	And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	Yes
2998	Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.	Yes
19848	I've supported all the education programs.	Yes
715	That's-at least that's what I read.	No
22909	Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	No
3616	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	Yes
18499	Her husband PJ got killed.	No
19859	Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	No
12040	I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	No
14619	You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	No
12879	This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	No
15563	I hear this talk about a blank check.	No
20637	I would take the use of force very seriously.	No
32629	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	No
11577	Now, have I got that wrong?	No
21407	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	No
15666	And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	No
23590	So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	No
8154	It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.	No
24902	To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	No
26529	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	No
92	Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	Yes
13155	We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	No
14496	You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	No
19955	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	No
21256	One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	No
30233	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	Yes
8888	Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	No
25597	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	No
29225	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	No
16057	I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	Yes
24633	Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	No
17303	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	No
34796	The report I cited also revealed that Saddam Hussein was using the oil-for-food strategy to eliminate sanctions.	Yes
575	But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.	No
22905	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	No
13154	The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.	No
16378	We can do better than that.	No
34999	The President's bill proposed to provide more assistance to Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and West Virginia areas that are in dire need, compared to the ones Senator Kennedy was advocating for.	Yes
13364	I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	No
23853	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	Yes
7461	And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	No
7218	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	Yes
7896	I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	No
14672	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	No
35221	When I was in the early 1990s, I backed Nunn-Lugar while many of my colleagues didn't.	Yes
25687	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	No
22394	How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	No
7619	We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	Yes
24735	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	Yes
22920	We're going to build alliances.	No
29960	It was very easy to do.	No
12563	But all this by itself is not enough.	No
2965	As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	No
20453	I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	No
23228	This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	Yes
22654	I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.	No
8242	I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.	No
21383	And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	No
21876	A senator runs every 6 years.	No
32271	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	Yes
9583	And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	No
22430	I hope I'm that person.	No
14097	There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.	No
11543	I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	No
13679	And I said I make a mistake.	No
9302	And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	No
35385	Throughout my 24 years, I have never been intimidated by the major drug manufacturers.	Yes
909	But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	Yes
8166	I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.	No
28684	Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	No
17659	So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	Yes
35492	The administration and Congress have not assisted him in carrying out his task.	Yes
14057	If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	No
35392	It took him almost eight years to double it, and he achieved it in seven-and-a-half years, partially to be precise.	Yes
15786	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	No
15755	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	No
19238	But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.	No
23225	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	Yes
7242	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	No
8960	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	No
32580	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	No
14566	If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	No
2228	And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	Yes
14314	And we got some very good Republican women running.	Yes
22948	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	No
20054	I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.	Yes
29599	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	No
35445	The average deductible for American families has increased by 30 percent, as per a recent report.	Yes
20142	Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.	No
22033	Everybody knows how to fix them.	No
35069	Your donors and special interests are following my lead, but with more frequency.	Yes
23584	No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	No
18984	Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	No
6346	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	Yes
8621	I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	No
26787	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	No
16618	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	No
35863	The president, or Congress, has the authority to allocate one-third of the president's budget, which involves appropriating every penny and advising Presidents on their spending.	Yes
346	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	No
33804	Take a look at the migration.	No
14183	I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	No
13128	That is the present American position.	No
9081	We've got to stop drifting.	No
14342	And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	No
18417	And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	Yes
20388	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	No
2215	So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	Yes
16405	I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	No
28758	Tell you what I hear.	No
11821	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	No
23500	A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	No
8011	We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	No
10669	My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
14720	It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	No
11047	So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	No
23138	First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	Yes
23085	That's what leadership is all about.	No
24470	And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	No
12772	Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.	No
13593	The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	Yes
16823	Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.	Yes
19562	It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	Yes
20136	We are better off than we were four years ago.	No
21336	And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	No
13596	It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	No
34644	Are you aware that Senator Obama has voted for and is now proposing $860 billion in new spending?	Yes
8950	But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	Yes
1589	Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	No
35658	He had the facts that were made public today right after the Mayaguez incident.	Yes
22105	NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.	No
20882	The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	Yes
8317	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	No
350	I'd say around 30 percent.	No
5529	We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	No
12526	And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	Yes
14952	We've had the Central Accounting.	Yes
123	But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.	No
12065	And we can enforce law.	No
14843	Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.	Yes
21771	Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	No
13417	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	Yes
1431	The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	Yes
17178	There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.	No
20125	In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	Yes
17845	"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"	No
1995	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	No
20545	I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	No
3782	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	No
17396	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	Yes
1458	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	Yes
35687	Their accounts of the war were completely different from their statements during August, September, and October when they testified at the end.	Yes
4021	And this was August, a year ago.	No
27296	... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	No
1543	As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	No
34738	Despite not wanting a free trade agreement with our regional best friend, Senator Obama wants to sit down with Hugo Chavez, the man who has been supporting FARC, without any preconditions.	Yes
8393	And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	No
14011	I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.	No
3879	And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	No
23317	We ought to be shutting those down.	No
17977	We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	No
12467	I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.	No
11846	We've got one in Texas.	No
1395	Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	No
24516	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	No
18876	But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.	No
34339	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	No
18002	I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	No
9708	Our party has been focused too long.	No
15310	That is the way it will stay.	No
29514	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	No
22915	It hurts the middle class.	No
34297	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	Yes
884	The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	No
15968	The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	No
31912	And I was embarrassed by it.	No
20994	I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	No
21632	But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	No
2075	And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	No
14448	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	Yes
34634	The statement mandates that insurance companies must provide rebates if they are spending more on administrative expenses and profits than on actual healthcare services.	Yes
7669	Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	No
23316	We've got all kinds of giveaways.	No
19463	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	No
4408	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	No
18236	And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	No
761	And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	Yes
22148	And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	No
23951	I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	No
30244	It well describes the problem.	No
25137	The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	No
29372	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	No
27124	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	No
17689	Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.	No
8508	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	Yes
20296	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	No
20285	And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	Yes
14717	I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.	No
16153	We ought to have rural enterprise zones.	No
35642	A greater share of the total tax burden is being paid by the wealthy.	Yes
32336	And we need to do our part.	No
34643	We are responsible for paying about 73 percent of NATO's expenses, so I believe we should be entitled to it.	Yes
34387	No, it's going to totally help you.	No
28165	Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	No
35122	Our country has a solar company that we have invested in.	Yes
12667	We want to be stronger.	No
18270	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	No
35808	We're providing them with more funding than ever before, and we'll continue to do so.	Yes
16610	This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	No
20262	I take him for his word.	No
35308	We remained loyal to democracy in Egypt.	Yes
23342	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	Yes
728	I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	No
21457	In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	Yes
15328	Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	No
18276	I think it's worthy for a follow-up.	No
26917	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	No
33634	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	Yes
11561	Now, there's more work to do.	No
34729	I recently visited the oldest American Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they are planning to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year and have generated 700 new jobs.	Yes
612	And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	No
24743	Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	Yes
33289	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	No
18326	"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	Yes
6783	Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	No
29430	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	No
30190	You didn't hear what I said.	No
4238	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	No
32401	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	No
297	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	No
19701	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	Yes
24339	the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	No
11216	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	No
21418	The dollar's gone through the floor.	No
29385	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	No
2021	And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	No
13239	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	No
13986	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	No
3049	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	No
855	No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	No
21380	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	Yes
19274	This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	No
33389	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	No
179	One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	No
27770	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	Yes
13143	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	No
20754	There is a huge difference in this campaign.	No
25851	And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.	No
11873	And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	No
19870	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	No
22414	No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	No
9934	I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	No
18138	And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	No
15405	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	No
24098	We've got to invest and grow.	No
35488	In numerous instances, they are illegal immigrants who have arrived here unlawfully.	Yes
29704	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	No
16651	We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.	Yes
4307	But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	Yes
30371	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	No
4305	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	No
35282	Figures from September 1980 suggest that there may be a shortage of approximately 104,000 individuals in the ranks between E-4 and E-9, as I have seen.	Yes
34980	The 28 nations of NATO agreed to join us in battling terrorism after 9/11, and they are still supporting us.	Yes
35785	The Burger Court's ruling has confirmed the controversial and fundamental decision made by the Warren Court.	Yes
16556	I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	No
7329	If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	No
8088	That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	No
2903	So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	No
11428	We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.	Yes
6534	223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.	Yes
22310	Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	No
7393	And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	No
1470	And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	Yes
19566	That would be my position.	No
28426	Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	Yes
27751	We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	No
27652	You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	No
20017	I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	No
34545	I was honored with a Good Guy Award from the Natl Women's Political Caucus for my efforts in supporting women in high-level government positions, and I have appointed more minorities to these positions than any other governor in my state' history.	Yes
24776	Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	No
2018	Well, the economy is still growing slow.	Yes
6391	The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
26353	And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	Yes
2371	Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	Yes
29688	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	Yes
12924	Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.	No
30249	I agree with her on one thing.	No
8197	We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	Yes
29930	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	No
35057	Two years ago, I mentioned that we are dealing with a sub-prime lending crisis.	Yes
34549	It is certain that there has been an increase in violent acts against Jews in France and Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations in recent years.	Yes
17198	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	No
21629	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	Yes
5768	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	Yes
22145	I'll close on this point.	No
16740	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	Yes
27118	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	No
29279	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	No
27505	I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	No
3559	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	Yes
15364	I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.	No
35344	The budget's domestic side has not seen any increase in spending over the past four years, as measured in constant dollars.	Yes
24969	I'm sure that you appreciate that.	No
33754	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	No
622	But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	No
28502	And I'm happy to tell you that we have.	No
14596	"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."	No
35886	The United States government is collaborating with the private sector to provide funding for innovation that can be exported to countries like China, which has set up one coal power plant per week and requires alternative solutions.	Yes
27280	And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	No
16506	As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	Yes
35367	Today's announcement revealed that we've experienced a rise of 1.9 million new jobs in the past 13 months.	Yes
35200	In 1980, the individual had dropped $500 from the poverty line.	Yes
17719	Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.	No
34986	The number of women living in poverty has increased by 3.5 million since the president's tenure.	Yes
939	I want to keep this expansion going.	No
35242	Within a year, you granted $90 billion in subsidies to the green energy sector.	Yes
13623	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	No
24759	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	No
20839	And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	Yes
34560	The Bureau of Census reports indicate that during Governor Carter's term as governor of Georgia, spending and employee spending increased by more than 50 percent.	Yes
35784	He paid a 10-fold increase, in reality.	Yes
25323	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	No
16573	As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	No
8936	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	No
18602	He has more of the same.	No
1079	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	Yes
12889	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	No
110	Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.	No
27518	They must not develop nuclear capability.	No
28186	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	No
35452	Laos received more military aid and per capita than any other country in the world, indicating a shift from neutralism to Communist rule.	Yes
1609	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	No
15305	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	Yes
21414	People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	Yes
15200	And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.	No
18025	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	No
33663	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	No
15248	We have the sources here.	No
7706	They set a low standard of materialism.	No
23488	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	Yes
13427	And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	Yes
16336	And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.	No
26428	We have a good, stable economic policy.	No
22901	Now, forget all this talk about a draft.	No
10564	And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	No
34469	Although hitting base camps is a common practice, the president's observation of Muammar Khadaffi'S state-sponsored fingerprints on American deaths led him to target Libya.	Yes
2155	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	No
6265	So we've got to get our education system right.	No
35701	I voted in favor of this legislation.	Yes
35537	You were pursuing him and even sent pictures of him dressed in a particular outfit, which were highly regarded.	Yes
23679	He shouldn't have made that decision.	No
27977	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
35255	The Congress's special session, chaired by Mr. Kennedy, rejected both that and the government contracts provision.	Yes
31933	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	No
25852	Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	Yes
10130	They're using cheap hand guns.	Yes
6175	"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	No
27995	I'm convinced we'll do it.	No
16640	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	Yes
16380	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	No
34787	The defense budget saw a 37% reduction in seven out of eight years.	Yes
7067	And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	No
28925	And in some cases may be still at large.	No
32479	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	No
3076	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	Yes
32207	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	No
9055	That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	No
25609	America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.	No
23161	Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	No
12740	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	No
26028	I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	No
13308	It must be a test of a man.	No
21886	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	No
3337	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	Yes
18691	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	No
16999	We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	No
33170	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	No
21450	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	Yes
14082	And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	No
13170	Yes, we should make a great effort.	No
1516	At the present time we're at peace.	No
12406	And we need to do something about that.	No
18392	We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.	Yes
35798	The passing of HOPE, the home initiative passed by Congress, is a positive step towards encouraging people to own their homes instead of living in these lethal tenancies.	Yes
450	I do not favor abortion.	No
3373	We can be once again.	No
8720	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	No
6863	That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.	Yes
17653	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	Yes
24657	I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.	No
21099	There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.	Yes
22613	But 9/11 changed it all.	No
28555	If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	No
17720	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	No
18774	Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.	Yes
25038	To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	No
3011	It's a matter of being consistent.	No
13613	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	Yes
35890	On average, President Roosevelt vetoed fifty-five bills per year, as per the records.	Yes
6505	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	No
33954	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	Yes
27404	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	Yes
12725	I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	No
1394	Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	No
22820	The military's job is to win the war.	No
25487	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	No
9058	But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	No
28740	Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	No
35468	What is more ethical in foreign policy than allowing the administration to lead the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974, where the United States committed six million metric tons of food, with over 60% of it going to underdeveloped countries?	Yes
29344	So is it President Obama's fault?	No
16061	I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	No
17267	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	No
12016	But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	No
14900	So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	No
21705	In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	Yes
2586	And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	No
20419	It's an issue I know a lot about.	No
25515	Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	No
5564	You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	No
16348	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	No
34511	He also pursued a disabled journalist, ridiculed and impersonated him on national television.	Yes
3997	"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	No
19971	And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	No
10576	My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	No
35047	You won't see a tax increase for someone earning less than $250,000, which is equivalent to one-quarter of your annual income.	Yes
33870	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	Yes
34008	You should have changed the law.	No
11582	I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	No
21980	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	Yes
29867	Well, I -- I do think...	No
10679	Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.	No
23863	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	Yes
10696	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	No
2588	And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	No
8849	What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?	No
32298	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	No
24801	Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	No
15873	I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	No
23010	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	No
35621	Our credibility in Pakistan was eroded due to our actions.	Yes
7048	Sure, there's more work to do.	No
14368	So that's what I'll do as president.	No
6251	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	No
5938	You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.	No
9394	That's not an energy strategy for the future.	No
5747	Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.	No
3523	The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	No
18347	They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.	No
18039	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	Yes
333	I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	No
8116	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	No
13256	And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	No
35159	Among the ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and Governor Reagan has repeatedly stated that it is the primary reason for unemployment.	Yes
20685	My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	No
1508	And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.	No
3957	I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	No
10475	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	No
15839	And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.	No
34636	The defense budget was reduced by $3 billion due to Pentagon pressure, as evidenced by his own testimony in front of the Office of Management and Budget.	Yes
34280	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	Yes
11566	When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	Yes
16966	It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	No
14184	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	No
7812	We must stand for our ideals.	No
8028	But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.	No
16482	And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	Yes
23230	They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	No
21860	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	Yes
9195	But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	Yes
20029	But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.	No
24354	That was their response to that sort of action.	No
35382	Senator, it's worth noting that I faced significant backlash from the teachers association in my home state when I advocated for teacher testing.	Yes
19813	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	No
21937	Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	No
24447	America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	No
13257	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	No
3293	Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	No
3070	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	No
3365	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	No
9713	I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	No
21163	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	No
12724	There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.	No
1050	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	Yes
1055	I don't know how to deal with it exactly.	No
24135	With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	Yes
7321	They don't reach those goals.	No
677	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	No
13729	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	No
3045	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	Yes
11650	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	No
1282	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	Yes
26416	Let's look at the facts.	No
876	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.	No
13732	I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	No
18800	We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.	Yes
26085	One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	No
17014	I believe that we can work together.	No
24934	But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	Yes
19777	That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	No
34977	350 teachers have been laid off in St. Louis alone.	Yes
20085	Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	Yes
1752	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	No
34684	Our gross domestic product is expected to increase by approximately 6 percent this year as the economy improves.	Yes
14868	I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	Yes
12223	But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.	No
24467	And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	No
13869	So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.	No
7832	I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	No
17699	I think the business community wants to get involved.	No
1962	This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.	No
3543	Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	No
6239	And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	No
35075	We've not only signed three trade agreements to expand our market reach, but we're also establishing a trade task force that targets businesses and workers who exploit unfair competition and lack fairness.	Yes
8497	And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	No
22593	He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.	Yes
27236	We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	No
29503	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	No
20771	Let me give you one example.	No
16622	I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	Yes
18884	He needed to be disarmed.	No
34713	In addition, we allocate $4.7 billion annually to the uninsured in Texas.	Yes
7278	Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.	No
11337	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	No
30035	It is -- it is a huge problem.	No
25459	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	No
3347	I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	No
10686	Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	No
28991	There was a chance to get this done.	No
10084	I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	Yes
35882	"The president's assertion that weapons of mass destruction were present, ""Mission accomplished,"" and that the war could be won without significant financial resources was not supported by any factual evidence."	Yes
20037	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	No
28398	So I want to do something about that.	No
4346	And this is the greatest country on Earth.	No
5984	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	No
7703	We have to practice what we preach.	No
6526	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	No
16553	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	Yes
25481	Let's take your warhead principle.	No
35912	I've been lending a hand to those and understand how to improve the economy, cut down on our dependence on foreign oil, and avoid sending $700 billion overseas each year.	Yes
35444	The majority of participants, 75%, believe that it lowers our probability of hiring people.	Yes
35763	Refusing to take action against the Federal Government's responsibility is a violation of the right of 55% of black Americans living in inner cities within metropolitan areas.	Yes
8202	We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	Yes
23019	And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	No
11050	We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	Yes
19405	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	Yes
21849	So I want to keep the quality of health care.	No
19733	I want to be very serious.	No
3148	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	No
33877	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	No
20470	We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	No
34852	Every proposal I've submitted to the Congress has been accompanied by it.	Yes
24653	This is a matter of life and death.	No
6280	There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	No
10975	Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.	No
24162	I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.	No
35204	And that's precisely what I did.	Yes
16526	Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	No
34638	In the end, California Governor, President Reagan, signed a bill that is widely considered the most liberal proabortion legislation in the United States.	Yes
25273	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	No
10639	Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?	Yes
1026	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	No
34539	The percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds earning less than $12,000.	Yes
15277	So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	No
8434	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.	Yes
22860	I fully understand the threat.	No
5971	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	No
24264	We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	No
15425	We must have a society that's just and fair.	No
19459	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	No
30090	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	No
686	We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	No
69	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	No
15186	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	No
23996	I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.	No
22454	Now that will change America.	No
32347	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	Yes
2334	That's why I'd have regulation.	No
17019	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	No
15603	He has raised taxes several times.	Yes
17464	It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	Yes
11249	We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	No
16606	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	No
25632	We know nothing about them.	No
24532	I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	No
23908	When I make a mistake I'll admit it.	No
27723	But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	No
19527	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	Yes
20784	And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
35246	The only way to achieve a tax cut is by reducing the tax increase, as the Administration has left us with an implicit $86 billion tax hike next year.	Yes
23637	I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	No
3938	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	Yes
11331	Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	No
25309	I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	No
29734	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	No
14736	Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	No
14869	Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	Yes
21225	There is a huge difference of opinion.	No
6666	And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	No
15398	We're now working on the communications industry.	Yes
11762	So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	No
19161	That's my difference with the President.	No
19151	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	No
21183	I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	No
25117	We were there for the better part of a year.	No
24841	The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	Yes
16852	What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	No
1303	But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.	No
6583	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	Yes
6880	Once again, the president is misleading America.	No
25307	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	No
16558	There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	No
35146	In comparison to eight years ago, the current population is 300,000 people.	Yes
24679	-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	No
27669	This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	Yes
20420	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	No
26933	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	Yes
29343	I wrote about that in my book...	No
14193	101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.	No
14315	So we're making dramatic progress.	No
13394	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	Yes
10648	And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	Yes
28662	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	No
29791	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	Yes
22451	Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	No
3052	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	No
34864	The number of people working on this issue across the entire federal government is less than 100, and I think our achievements and failures at Geneva have been reflected in it.	Yes
6739	The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.	No
27831	I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	Yes
28173	Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	Yes
15774	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	No
21974	When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	No
271	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	No
20896	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	No
17553	What does this mean in real life?	No
6013	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	No
34155	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
19624	And I hope that will happen.	No
9184	And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.	No
35914	The President's recent use of statistics on California is a distortion of the situation, as my tenure as Governor of California resulted in fewer per capita spending increases while Mr. Carter was serving as governor of Georgia.	Yes
9038	And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.	No
29889	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	Yes
35028	Taxes are being levied on Detroit, with the money going to Chicago and the tax dollars flowing into that area to help with Philadelphia's problems.	Yes
21427	WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deal with our problems, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve our problems.	No
953	And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	No
23543	I did to because I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.	No
35233	We had to deal with high inflation rates exceeding 12 percent and a significant amount of joblessness.	Yes
21497	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	No
16623	For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	Yes
18992	I can't say it any more plainly.	No
3069	We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.	Yes
1973	That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	Yes
20819	We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.	No
25570	Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	No
14812	Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	No
8169	And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	No
25956	And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	Yes
1428	As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	Yes
14898	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	Yes
35722	It's difficult to believe that after eight years, you will be the one to lead and control spending while balancing tax cuts for middle-class families.	Yes
1113	The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	No
17811	But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	No
34431	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	No
27500	And I've been very clear to them.	No
35638	The unemployment rate in downtown urban ghetto areas is extremely high, with the majority of people falling into the 50s and 60s, particularly those who are very poor and belonging to minority groups.	Yes
8917	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	Yes
13095	But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	No
15333	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	No
3784	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	Yes
35251	Despite the small business exemption, Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he believed that other nations could not do so.	Yes
23696	I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	No
12872	If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	No
16839	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	No
1663	Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.	Yes
3577	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	Yes
35065	During his tenure as Under Secretary of State in 1958, Mr. Herter declared that they were not strategically viable.	Yes
9242	So here's what I've done since I've been president.	No
8430	I favor higher salaries for teachers.	No
34470	9 countries have a higher expenditure on public education than our national budget.	Yes
21646	There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.	No
21122	The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	Yes
35262	The bill that passed the Congress and signed by the President would result in a billion dollars spent on the Treasury's funds, as per my proposal.	Yes
25586	But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	No
19312	I thought that was wrong.	No
35783	Our country has never reached this level before.	Yes
13706	Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	Yes
17528	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	No
35214	Our economy is centered around the industrial sector.	Yes
19472	And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	No
2894	What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	No
23353	We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.	Yes
33858	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	No
12847	The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.	Yes
32440	But I have no loans with Russia.	Yes
14273	Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	Yes
35480	It's unclear if it was a criminal or paternal matter, but the truth is that it cost $3 million in taxpayers' money.	Yes
33888	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	Yes
21594	Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	No
13093	There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	Yes
4046	But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	No
13363	Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	Yes
11720	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	No
24761	He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	Yes
23332	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	Yes
974	The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.	No
1940	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	Yes
35049	I think it's correct that Governor Carter is advocating for gun control by recommending the discontinuation of the sale of Saturday Night S- Specials, but he also wants to register handguns.	Yes
6561	But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	No
2290	Let me give you an example.	No
12668	We want freedom to gain.	No
19950	It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	Yes
1188	If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	No
19049	And we'll continue to spread freedom.	No
392	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	No
5668	That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.	No
4053	A testimony to you, Jim.	No
21178	We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.	No
35654	Others either stayed still or cast their votes against us.	Yes
20647	Morale in today's military is too low.	No
14852	That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	No
17011	I owe the special interests nothing.	No
3994	And we've got a choice.	No
8722	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	Yes
19744	It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.	No
14198	This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	No
11645	We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	Yes
14272	We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	Yes
429	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	Yes
23292	You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.	Yes
35727	The Congress accepted a significant package of quality-of-life improvements, which I also presented.	Yes
23881	We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	No
21417	And what's happened in the meantime?	No
7980	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	No
35691	Teachers and parents, often business people, have created 3,000 new schools called charter schools, which are funded by money and have no regulations or bureaucratic restrictions. They can only continue to exist if they deliver children.	Yes
3046	The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.	No
21191	You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	No
7823	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	No
34667	Those who cultivate tomatoes pay less for their produce than the can label.	Yes
19941	I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.	No
12600	Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	Yes
15604	I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	No
15438	There is a partnership involved in our nation.	No
33867	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	Yes
23730	He wants your kids to pay for it.	No
32442	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	No
15752	We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.	No
7520	And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	No
21086	That's the difference of opinion.	No
28332	So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	No
3651	I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	Yes
24813	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	No
24359	The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	Yes
11652	In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	Yes
35323	There are numerous sources that confirm his involvement in the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
1739	Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.	Yes
33992	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	Yes
891	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	No
26239	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	No
266	"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	No
35351	The country has plans to construct 36 power plants for nuclear energy.	Yes
5766	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	No
10143	We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	Yes
29250	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	Yes
29119	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	No
33716	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	Yes
34671	My proposal for a program that would have covered medical care for the elderly in Social Security, paid for through the Social security system and the social security tax, was unsuccessful in the US Senate, where it was defeated by five votes.	Yes
20530	I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	Yes
29497	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	Yes
29622	Our country has tremendous problems.	No
34962	To give an example, we proposed a budget of approximately $12 million for the National Park Service to add between four and five hundred new workers.	Yes
27524	Bob, let me just respond.	No
21810	So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	No
136	It's not going to cost the government money.	No
22642	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	Yes
19325	The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	No
15665	Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.	No
12761	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	Yes
35560	She referred to it as the gold standard.	Yes
32538	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	Yes
35210	The family values of American workers who are committed to committing suicide have been observed working harder and harder for less in a country that has had the worst economic times in 50 years and experienced the first decline in industrial production since World War II.	Yes
6785	I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	No
35570	At the outset, it should be noted that this board is not in charge of deciding the treatments to be administered.	Yes
35482	The Soviet Union's belief that they were relying more on land-based missiles led us to bring up all three, which was unexpected.	Yes
3479	And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	No
25442	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	No
3909	This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	No
35545	The president reduced the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands and in federal waters by half.	Yes
15095	And I said, well, yes.	No
7932	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	No
744	And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.	Yes
2951	If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	No
12720	Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	No
12952	My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	No
8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	No
17191	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	No
25966	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	No
29995	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	No
35758	Mr. Mondale should be aware that the president of the United States did not instruct the marines to enter the barracks.	Yes
19706	We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	Yes
10118	But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	No
19141	But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.	Yes
8117	If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	No
2190	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	Yes
33830	And I think it's her campaign.	No
34794	They're putting up millions of dollars of ads against me.	Yes
19979	You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.	No
26909	But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.	No
23172	He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	No
24980	I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.	No
3673	With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	Yes
21400	Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.	Yes
19658	And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	Yes
15428	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	No
1401	He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.	Yes
32727	Why can't they do it quietly?	No
25774	You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.	No
21976	What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	No
21653	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	No
26033	Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	Yes
20755	He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	No
9014	I believe in freedom of choice.	No
17489	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	No
19667	And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.	No
17968	I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	No
13429	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	No
30330	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	No
30202	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	No
20267	I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	Yes
12775	I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	No
13392	Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	No
23222	Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
24212	Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	No
35746	The Republicans' record of opposition to housing, elderly care, federal aid for education, and minimum wage in recent years is noteworthy.	Yes
30342	And it's a big problem.	No
17879	"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	No
10624	And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	No
34551	The population of Egypt is 80 million, whereas Libya's is only 6 million.	Yes
34591	The Federal government has been reduced to its lowest level in 30 years, as an illustration.	Yes
24999	And I made it plain to them, we're not.	No
35703	The current workforce represents a higher percentage of Americans than any other time in history.	Yes
30352	But you have to have some basic ability.	No
12191	So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	No
8245	I know what it means to be poor.	No
24911	A President is called the Commander in Chief.	No
27125	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	No
16136	There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	No
14838	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	No
25210	I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	No
12975	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	No
17790	If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	Yes
35903	They have committed to spending approximately $200 million, but only $3 million has been spent on initiating it.	Yes
15537	And that's why people are so concerned.	No
17290	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	No
23416	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	Yes
32903	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	No
16273	I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	No
20514	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	No
29303	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	Yes
7511	And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	No
2318	You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	Yes
29698	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	No
16097	I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	No
25240	It is a question of leadership.	No
5855	And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	No
6458	Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.	No
487	One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	No
23104	You can pull it off of the Internet.	No
33703	China is growing at 7 percent.	Yes
15772	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	Yes
9887	Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	No
33725	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
7749	It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	Yes
19416	I think we all do.	No
24189	Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.	No
28621	It's not the right thing to do.	No
2427	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.	Yes
13012	There are only three left.	Yes
23084	I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	Yes
503	So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	No
34704	To improve the coordination of our borders and ports, my administration collaborated with Congress to establish the Department of Homeland Security.	Yes
5580	Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	Yes
7615	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	No
11225	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	No
14394	We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	Yes
2195	And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	No
35576	The entire tape had been started by her.	Yes
7339	This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	Yes
4286	I've got to make this point, Jim.	No
15928	And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	No
4211	"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	No
35320	Police, border patrol, special units, and 100,000 troops have been trained.	Yes
31874	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	No
8879	In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	No
25905	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	No
34583	I was against the subsidies for ethanol, as they were likely to distort the market and cause inflation, but Senator Obama stood by them.	Yes
3888	That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	No
11890	And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	No
12464	I'm running to get some things done for America.	No
19010	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	Yes
15175	Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	No
27259	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	No
16753	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	Yes
14492	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	No
34035	But I think they're going to see through it.	No
19834	Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.	No
17848	I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.	No
8225	Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	No
32752	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	No
16480	For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	Yes
2929	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	Yes
4022	"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""	No
1979	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	No
24273	We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	No
1402	The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	No
24702	All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	No
19830	But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.	No
26765	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	No
2658	I don't just talk about it.	No
35525	Our police force is being outmatched in multiple locations.	Yes
29104	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	No
35651	The number of generals and admirals who supported me is 200.	Yes
35643	Our troops are providing support in Iraq.	Yes
24843	Take a look at the Middle East.	No
27858	Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.	No
34669	Mr. Mondale, I can relate to your stance as a Senator because you participated in 16 tax hikes.	Yes
21023	I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.	No
15574	He's broken it three times in the past year already.	Yes
17390	I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	No
33831	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	Yes
4025	I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.	No
19182	Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	Yes
20661	Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.	No
34773	Those are the same people who experienced increased income and decreased taxes in the 1980s.	Yes
1300	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	Yes
34490	In the past, we've witnessed the annihilation of elected governments and the staunch advocacy of military authoritarianism, as seen in Chile.	Yes
15172	You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	No
23524	And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	No
34711	A surgeon or a lady, prior to General McCaffrey, suggested legalizing drugs.	Yes
17322	And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	Yes
33536	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	No
34556	Some of those countries have an average annual income of twenty-five dollars.	Yes
16491	I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	Yes
35151	We endeavored to allocate five billion dollars for our defenses at 1953.	Yes
34750	It was not handled by the administration.	Yes
24609	"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	No
22296	I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	No
2994	I wouldn't single out just food.	No
29677	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	Yes
7344	I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	No
32191	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	Yes
18912	And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	No
25310	And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	No
32512	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	Yes
28048	It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	Yes
35173	It's our duty to do both, and my plan is for that.	Yes
11860	And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	No
7998	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	No
29580	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	No
35141	The Patriot Act is necessary because different FBI departments are unable to communicate with each other.	Yes
11880	We can do better in our public schools.	No
35348	The number of uninsured individuals in our country is 35 million, and I see them on a regular basis.	Yes
27917	I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	No
17708	There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	Yes
23311	Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	Yes
14815	America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	No
22304	School choice -- public, private or religious.	No
3062	But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	No
17033	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	No
30399	.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	No
14637	Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.	No
19235	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	Yes
14413	Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.	No
16390	But we have enormous differences.	No
26059	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	No
844	And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.	No
19699	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	No
7952	In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.	No
22483	Our schools are now better.	No
16827	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	No
1041	I know I'm ready for it.	No
33268	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	No
10376	And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.	No
83	And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	No
34025	I'm not looking at anything now.	No
25626	I remember driving down the California coast one day.	No
26015	Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	No
21076	Now, Social Security has never done that.	Yes
5574	We're not going to do that in my administration.	No
15066	Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	No
13099	As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	No
13646	You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	No
34899	I've backed all the education initiatives.	Yes
15042	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	Yes
26836	Could have a chance to serve as president.	No
14954	We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	No
14189	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	No
34776	By purchasing a computer for their child who is going to college, they can spend more money, while businesses gain more customers, make more profits, and hire more employees.	Yes
8299	They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	No
7837	I'm very familiar with it.	No
23867	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	No
24184	You don't have anywhere to sleep.	No
18821	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	Yes
7851	One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	No
12551	In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	No
8322	I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	No
3508	And I promise you that that will happen.	No
13661	And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	Yes
15573	Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	No
24672	-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	No
15802	In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	No
16984	There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	No
25270	This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	No
26029	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	No
33749	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	Yes
15029	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	No
18960	That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	No
17486	Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	No
25147	The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	Yes
19376	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	No
35368	Our economy was hit by an attack during a recession, leading to the loss of 1 million jobs.	Yes
5897	It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	No
18431	We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.	Yes
17589	And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	Yes
27252	Trade grows about 12 percent year.	Yes
33833	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	Yes
2293	One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	Yes
34998	The loss of jobs has made him the first president to do so in 72 years.	Yes
16601	We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	No
33991	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	Yes
27811	But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	Yes
17273	I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	No
34879	Iran's sole Arab alligator is Syria.	Yes
7889	I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	No
21871	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	No
6293	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	No
33891	That is not who America is.	No
19275	First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	Yes
11037	And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	No
6550	If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	No
18188	That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	No
24078	Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	No
387	Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	No
19253	Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	No
20324	No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	No
641	But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.	No
27900	No, I am not wrong.	No
11726	And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	No
34841	In Chicago, 46% of teachers who teach in public schools opt to send their students to private schools instead of attending schools.	Yes
34777	America's newspapers have reported on the front pages that there are more than 100,000 hours of unrecorded tapes.	Yes
35850	Haiti's democratically elected president is now in power.	Yes
33464	Now we can talk about Putin.	No
1535	We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	Yes
24127	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	Yes
12525	In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	Yes
26730	It's God's will, it'll happen.	No
18519	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	No
35679	A significant number of young African-American and Latino men were incarcerated for nonviolent crimes.	Yes
21094	It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	No
23857	We have got to have the courage to change.	No
16362	I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	No
19099	Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	No
11640	And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	No
32669	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	No
34975	The commission has been passed on to school districts in 35 States, but without the involvement of the Federal Government, task forces are now responsible for addressing educational issues.	Yes
14383	They investigated every single one of my children.	Yes
35044	The production of oil from offshore oiling is currently limited to 2% through leased lines.	Yes
8809	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	No
12127	So it's one of my top priorities.	No
27059	We have made sure that they are isolated.	No
16731	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	No
32084	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	Yes
3374	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	No
31840	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	No
29917	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	No
13953	And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	Yes
35562	Despite my constant public advocacy for drug legalization, I am still not in favor of it.	Yes
2242	We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	No
386	I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.	No
11710	But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	No
17846	The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	No
12611	Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?	No
7418	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	No
9020	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	Yes
2301	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	No
12803	I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	No
14533	Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	No
35704	His book stated that the absence of a workable exit strategy was the reason for his failure.	Yes
19473	And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	No
19411	We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	Yes
35899	This has not been resolved by Mr. Ford.	Yes
8531	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	No
15459	I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	Yes
21545	So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	No
22733	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.	No
20908	Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.	No
35450	Our country ranks fifteenth in terms of infant mortality among all countries globally.	Yes
23519	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	No
7798	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	No
9018	And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.	Yes
9403	So I get the last question -- last answer --	No
29687	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	No
21179	People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.	No
22924	Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	No
15339	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	Yes
25015	That is where I think the future of the world lies.	No
5951	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	Yes
6452	We're proud to be here.	No
35059	Each of those nations is self-governing and has its own territorial boundaries, and the United States does not recognize that they are under the authority of the Soviet Union.	Yes
27922	When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	Yes
29784	We cannot just say law and order.	No
33651	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	No
23782	The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.	Yes
6631	I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	No
32808	But she's lied about a lot of things.	Yes
9628	I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.	No
35224	Donald's proposal to cut massive taxes will result in a $20 trillion national debt.	Yes
17587	At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.	Yes
35386	The American Hospital Association claimed that the budget I vetoed could have resultedited in the closure of 700 hospitals.	Yes
17428	But I finally did it.	No
29105	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	No
515	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	No
34096	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	Yes
8221	And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	No
34687	The senator's campaign has caused me to worry that I have been paying close attention to his words and may be changing his stance on the Iraq war.	Yes
26116	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	No
2814	That's got to be changed.	No
34810	The economy has been negatively impacted by the excessive regulation of legislation during the president's term.	Yes
20460	My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.	No
9418	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	No
14680	Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	No
25912	We had to make cuts.	No
7656	And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.	No
29832	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	Yes
16322	and must do what he's talking about now.	No
14438	Come on, that's not leadership.	No
20168	I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	No
24952	Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.	No
5987	Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	No
10751	It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	No
8927	So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	No
23241	But let me talk back about where we've been.	No
2200	Benefits were not affected at all.	Yes
1313	In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.	No
12575	I have sustained it since then.	Yes
27827	Governor Romney, you did not...	No
8071	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	No
34759	This Administration has accomplished four times the number of projects completed compared to the previous administration.	Yes
10390	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	No
29898	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	No
28466	When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.	No
16707	The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	Yes
15785	But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	No
15984	I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.	No
15924	It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	No
2963	I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	No
13133	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	Yes
27557	Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	Yes
21240	I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	No
3233	Another point I wanna make is this.	No
7693	I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	Yes
6225	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	No
35139	Two-thirds of the taxes paid by those individuals were cut from 50,000 down.	Yes
2226	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	No
9773	"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""	No
3668	Look, it's just not true.	No
5538	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	No
1936	Number two is to cut spending.	No
6897	It's not a government plan.	No
24291	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	No
19696	We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	No
34847	The same sales pitch that was used in 2001 and 2003 is being used by Governor Romney, resulting in the slowest job growth since 1990, moving from surplus to deficit, and ultimately causing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
34079	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	No
3307	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	No
24603	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	Yes
35258	As you may have already known, the resolutions passed by Congress have resulted in an extra $17 billion in spending over the budget I proposed.	Yes
34995	Americans from the middle class are working harder and earning more money than they did a decade ago, which is further compounding their tax burden.	Yes
25489	But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	No
35574	Should there be any inequities in oil or commodity, I would vote to close the loophole. I have previously voted to decrease the depletion allowance for major producers from five million dollars down to twenty-seven and a half per cent.	Yes
28802	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	Yes
21616	Help me pass these programs.	No
11150	Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	No
18208	We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	No
32633	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	No
639	I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.	No
26731	The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.	No
11759	It needs to be available for emergency situations.	No
12439	Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	No
13842	But let's take my life in perspective.	No
782	Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	No
19650	The President was opposed to it in 1993.	Yes
7886	Let me make my position cl ear.	No
8760	But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	Yes
28246	It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.	No
20089	I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	No
16862	I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.	No
12698	By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	Yes
7090	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	No
20092	But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	No
25772	I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	No
35286	In 1971, I opposed a Constitutional amendment in the House of Representatives twice, not once, but with the aim of reinstating prayer in public schools.	Yes
27596	But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	Yes
34709	Israel was responsible for 60 percent of the weapons sent to the Middle East during the last Democratic administration.	Yes
29274	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	Yes
32461	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	No
8977	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	No
34846	The education budget could be reduced by up to 20 percent if the actual amount of money is computed using an extrapolation method.	Yes
17484	Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	No
30052	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	Yes
2897	I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	No
27760	It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.	Yes
9611	And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	Yes
19290	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	Yes
22884	We're not going to have a draft, period.	No
10948	That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.	No
2317	You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.	No
2755	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	Yes
35650	The fact that we are now energy-independent is a first, and it sounds like you're either in the business or aware of those in your industry.	Yes
21235	I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	No
25407	Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	No
16732	And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	Yes
26612	It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.	No
7531	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	No
20836	That's my vision for public education all around America.	No
8545	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	No
34632	A Senate with a Democratic majority has not allowed it to proceed.	Yes
17802	Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	Yes
27339	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	No
2211	So that's -- that's number one.	No
35500	Out of the 17 banned assault weapons, only six have been banned since the ban was reinstated, with eleven having been modified and reintroduced to public streets.	Yes
120	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	No
3431	How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	No
2114	So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	No
18846	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	No
741	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	No
3451	So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	No
18538	"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""	No
12615	By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?	No
358	Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	Yes
7030	That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	Yes
27653	When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	No
3027	He indicates he would not make those.	No
20154	Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	No
24207	Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.	No
7477	But I can take it.	No
22843	So what do we do?	No
34579	As long as their economy is plagued by extreme poverty and unemployment, they will seek out job opportunities in other countries.	Yes
26261	I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	No
26030	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	No
12953	Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	Yes
25781	I know you do it.	No
17210	I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	No
2088	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	Yes
13017	Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	No
34770	The bill was not too extreme, but it was rejected by at least four Democrats out of eight who voted to send it to the House floor, with only one Republican being included.	Yes
12904	He says he supports the President's position.	Yes
16109	That is absolutely not true.	No
3113	I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	No
6248	He's health for the mother.	No
90	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	No
20486	I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.	No
35702	She is exorbitantly raising taxes on all of us.	Yes
12708	Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	No
24619	"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	No
26510	And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	Yes
13266	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	Yes
17776	But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	No
19095	Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	Yes
35666	The fact that 67 percent of voters voted for me in my second term made me feel both proud and humble.	Yes
34831	Early this week, I came across an early article in The Wall Street Journal that a task force led by the speaker advocated for improving Social Security by decreasing adjustment for retired retirees to account for inflation.	Yes
3217	And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	No
25505	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	Yes
34958	Pay attention to Sarah Brady, the wife of Jim Brady and press secretary for President Reagan, who backed me because of his opposition to the NRA and refusal to back the Brady Bill.	Yes
18077	I decided to go there myself.	No
14415	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	Yes
35683	The United States Senate's most liberal senator is Obama.	Yes
14255	Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	Yes
30103	Well, I have to respond.	No
1457	Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.	Yes
3763	There's no doubt itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna affect our budgets.	No
15114	And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	Yes
751	That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	No
1751	Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	No
8367	The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	No
3188	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	Yes
16638	Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	Yes
14297	You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	No
28412	But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	Yes
35136	The lead concentration has decreased by 90 percent since I led the regulatory task force.	Yes
18240	"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""	Yes
34927	We have pledged to provide $200 million in aid.	Yes
27818	My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	No
20786	$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
34102	I've got no illusions about that.	No
14458	Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	No
22953	Thank you very much, Ann.	No
8494	Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.	No
7707	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	No
33549	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	Yes
15208	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	Yes
17286	All history tells us that that's a mistake.	No
24539	We need a hundred thousand more police on the street.	No
499	The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.	No
32522	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	Yes
17755	And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	No
314	My parents came to this country as immigrants.	No
28896	No, I'm not proud of that.	No
32338	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	No
28037	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	No
10156	They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	Yes
12930	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	No
4380	So this is a national security issue.	No
8934	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	No
19767	It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	No
35731	The unemployment rolls have registered a little over 500,000 Americans in the past four months.	Yes
12328	What are we going to tell our children?	No
3242	I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	No
12760	Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	No
16531	Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	No
25856	Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	No
7605	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	Yes
1912	Number two, let's look at history.	No
2422	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	Yes
25979	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	Yes
6967	But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	No
32930	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
3600	I think those are pretty important priorities.	No
18770	And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	No
19507	Look at where we are today.	No
14473	Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	Yes
2605	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	No
29574	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	No
35225	I backed the endeavor to offer superior guidance to the courts, but John McCain was against it.	Yes
24921	That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	No
5579	... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	No
896	But you talk about judgment.	No
34947	The number of schools built has increased significantly over the past seven and a half years, as well as in the last twenty years.	Yes
17593	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	Yes
34	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
34854	The decision is a strategic misstep, as every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida poses the most significant threat to the United States, and Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front was located in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	Yes
13477	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	No
20174	And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	No
26908	With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	No
25587	That's key to the strength of our nation.	No
16168	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	No
29852	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	No
26632	See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	No
14087	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	Yes
18645	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	No
32076	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	No
1042	I think the American people are too.	No
21952	Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	No
12090	And that's what needs to happen.	No
2005	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
4372	They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	Yes
8903	And why have they lost their industry?	No
3958	So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
35417	The sanctions against Iran were not enforced by my government.	Yes
33333	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	No
29566	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	No
35568	Governor Romney has been advocating for 18 months about a $5 trillion tax cut, which would also result in an additional $2 trillion in military spending.	Yes
25574	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	No
1422	But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	Yes
23904	I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.	No
20973	They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.	No
7787	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	No
3710	We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.	Yes
17359	The American people want their children educated.	No
8127	I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	Yes
13678	Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.	Yes
4028	And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	No
2979	The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	Yes
35287	As per your statement, the DISC count was roughly 1.4 billion.	Yes
3619	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	No
2565	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	No
19374	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	No
7678	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	No
28660	I don't think that's the role of the president.	No
34427	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	No
33934	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	Yes
16020	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
14187	That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	No
23544	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	No
10917	And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.	No
27354	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	Yes
29694	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	No
22001	So at least we have time to work with it.	No
22254	There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	No
27091	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	No
3152	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	Yes
1378	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	Yes
16617	But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.	Yes
23441	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	No
6122	So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	No
1944	Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	No
28518	And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
10187	And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	No
21312	Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.	No
34735	The United States has seen an increase in its budget over the last ten years, with an average of 11 percent per year.	Yes
15434	Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	No
10985	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	No
17759	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	Yes
14757	Together we can get anything done.	No
14396	We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	Yes
29740	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	Yes
14477	I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.	No
16520	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	No
3171	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	No
20499	Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	No
11208	And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	Yes
18615	That's why it's essential we win.	No
19482	The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	Yes
35854	The birth certificate was not obtained by her.	Yes
7024	And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	No
23054	Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?	No
1473	He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.	Yes
27803	We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	No
26761	Well, I hope I made my answer clear.	No
16641	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	Yes
27171	But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	No
32817	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	Yes
17903	And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	No
2366	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	No
11364	It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	No
4027	And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.	No
21397	We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	No
20554	I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
16041	But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	No
9963	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	No
21123	That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	Yes
12601	Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	No
15199	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	No
32488	That in itself is a big difference.	No
6237	The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.	No
18709	And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	No
13495	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	No
27585	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	Yes
14849	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	No
2930	The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	Yes
5663	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	Yes
34646	The most expensive component in the car manufacturing process is the labor cost, which comes with a wage of $1 per hour and no health care coverage.	Yes
33757	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	No
22650	Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	No
25078	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	No
7733	Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	No
27285	And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	No
14955	I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	Yes
14051	And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	No
119	He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.	Yes
23762	I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	No
2384	And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	No
26419	We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	Yes
27115	I don't anticipate that in the future.	No
15306	I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.	Yes
13459	If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	No
14100	Now give me 1 second...	No
8726	We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	Yes
25091	We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	No
17715	Well, it isn't going to go back up.	No
17017	On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.	No
27740	Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	No
12585	Is our relative strength growing?	No
1118	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	No
18600	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	No
19349	That's why we need campaign finance reform.	No
34675	For the first time, we exported telecommunications equipment worth 37 billion dollars in California.	Yes
28526	But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	No
3789	I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	Yes
21661	These people are hurting in the inner cities.	No
19747	We've lost credibility around the world.	No
33105	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	No
12518	Who threatens freedom in the world?	No
14235	I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.	No
16176	I am for clean water.	No
17175	No one else believes that's the case.	No
27248	I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	No
21639	But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	Yes
17278	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	No
1489	I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	Yes
10221	It used to be the United States of America.	No
35327	In Washington, D.C. and Wall Street, Main Street is being penalized for their excesses and greed.	Yes
2802	In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	No
29439	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	No
35403	I have made it clear from the beginning of this campaign that there is a moral and economic imperative to address the health care crisis that many families are facing.	Yes
16194	I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	No
24085	We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	No
22244	Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	No
35803	Energy is under attack from the Obama administration, making this a great question.	Yes
35322	All my children and roughly 98 percent of adults were insured while I was governor of my state.	Yes
17310	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	No
15627	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	No
26988	Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	Yes
23430	Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	No
20778	There is a difference of opinion.	No
34592	I vetoed the budget that you passed, which meant that Headstart would lose 50,000 children.	Yes
12641	There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	Yes
10854	I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.	Yes
35518	The VA provides drugs to our veterans at a lower cost.	Yes
13335	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	No
26589	And people have to decide.	No
14877	Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	No
6842	We're beginning to do it.	No
4258	Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.	Yes
35360	There are a multitude of people waiting in line to adopt children who cannot be taken in any other way.	Yes
12695	We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.	Yes
27160	I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	No
35877	The top one percent of income earners in America received a $89 billion tax cut last year.	Yes
16311	That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	No
6930	It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.	Yes
7918	If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	No
10543	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	No
25602	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	No
26846	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	No
24171	Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.	No
7281	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	No
23326	It's been there for 20 years.	No
34635	The American people will not be excluded from the process like Mr. Ford and Kissinger have in the future.	Yes
34771	We provide a cut of $2.50 for every reduction, and we request $1 in additional revenue by asking those who have done well in the country to contribute more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
24345	And we are helping democracy, Ross.	No
7006	We heard the same thing.	No
23869	And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	No
675	Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	No
13110	This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.	No
34766	At present, we spend approximately $300 billion annually on defense, while the Japanese and Germans respectively spend around 30 billion in Asia and Europe.	Yes
1215	And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	Yes
35875	He has stated that he will only tax the wealthy.	Yes
7704	We set a very high standard for ourselves.	No
9074	Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	Yes
7745	That's a test of prestige.	No
34799	A bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats, with a majority of Republican members who supported my candidacy, announced that my proposal will save the average family $1200 more annually than the Bush plan by 2000, $2.2 trillion over the next 12 years, and $400 billion annually by the end of this decade.	Yes
17772	Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	No
22708	I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	No
35649	The dock was the destination of Coast Guard cutters who were not patrolling during the summer.	Yes
29831	And it was terminated by current mayor.	Yes
2289	And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.	Yes
13605	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	No
22419	I do not want to raise taxes.	No
27642	And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	No
19433	And we have a responsibility.	No
13899	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	No
16751	In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.	Yes
27374	I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	No
29456	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	No
33011	The question was about the Supreme Court.	No
35058	To ensure that coal is produced with greater efficiency and purity, we have invested the most in clean coal technology.	Yes
19218	It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	No
8687	But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	No
22092	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	No
6577	Now, I'm going to reverse that.	No
16532	The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	No
8509	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	No
8586	The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.	No
17026	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	No
11552	I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	No
29201	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	Yes
24818	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	No
26623	And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	No
400	We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	No
5588	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	Yes
35618	We're providing them with a generous amount of money and everything they need.	Yes
27822	And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	Yes
16228	The American people are up to here with debates.	No
722	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	No
24717	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	No
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
15423	I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	No
28716	You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	No
8080	Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	No
35891	"The irony is that if Obamacare is repealed, and I am no longer inclined towards the term ""Obama"", then those who are older will immediately have to pay an additional $600 for prescription care."	Yes
1808	So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	No
32324	We have enough problems in this country.	No
3153	I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
11155	Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	No
9048	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	No
34642	Our capacity to effectively deal with the Central American conflict has been compromised by our inability to work together in a constructive and honest manner with Mexico, Costa Rica, and other nations.	Yes
28753	They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	No
13645	The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	No
13769	And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	Yes
1361	You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.	No
12940	You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	Yes
12063	Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.	No
10662	I know how to do that.	No
9377	And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	No
29226	We wish you a lot of luck.	No
7883	Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	No
6112	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	Yes
28424	Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.	No
19768	And I don't intend to politicize it.	No
4068	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	No
27176	This -- we have weakened our economy.	Yes
4318	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	No
35512	We've been working on this administration to create an agricultural policy in this country that provides a decent future and pays for our farm families at varying prices, rather than spending $20-25 billion annually.	Yes
35443	More weapons have been produced in the past four years, leading to a more extensive and intense arms race than any other time since humanity began.	Yes
20430	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	No
13767	I've been speaking out since day 1.	No
12355	Oh, you mean the rules.	No
20798	Take for example the marriage penalty.	No
12134	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	No
20334	If I could respond to that.	No
28783	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	No
35761	At the moment, we have 543.	Yes
34525	Our workforce would have suffered a loss of one million jobs.	Yes
23778	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	No
25536	I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	No
2176	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	No
26160	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	No
2025	That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	Yes
11858	So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	No
25614	Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	No
6960	First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	No
21655	Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	No
24022	We simply cannot pull back.	No
15145	The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	Yes
34229	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	No
8074	All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.	No
22210	Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	No
34708	The Wall Street Journal's front page informed me that NATO is establishing a significant terror unit four months ago.	Yes
21699	I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	No
3903	We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.	No
35267	The fact that we will be in debt for an additional $50 million within an hour and a half while sitting here tonight is intriguing to me.	Yes
32013	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	No
20350	Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	No
7519	In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	No
6866	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	Yes
7760	But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	No
20428	Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	Yes
19129	Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.	No
3998	And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	Yes
28379	He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	No
15006	But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	No
27551	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	Yes
26373	He still believes it's a mistake.	No
35273	160 percent of all cocaine consumption is consumed.	Yes
14434	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	Yes
13262	For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	No
15895	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	No
25891	Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.	No
20907	All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.	No
14564	Now, I'll tell ya this.	No
2752	If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	No
17363	They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	No
22612	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	No
26170	The president has been AWOL for four years.	No
34983	The Federal Government did not intervene in State policy until the Supreme Court made a decision.	Yes
13186	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	No
24968	So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.	No
35442	The White House staff, when I was inaugurated, had a workforce of approximately five hundred employees.	Yes
32577	Why didn't you do it?	No
20378	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	Yes
7691	There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	Yes
24407	American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.	Yes
11045	When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	Yes
27665	No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	Yes
7466	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	No
12816	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	No
10728	You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	No
3259	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	No
34494	The deficiency has been increasing for the past 12 years.	Yes
10930	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	Yes
21366	If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	No
18190	I'm going to do it in four years.	No
25318	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	No
1530	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	No
654	And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.	No
8436	But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	No
17406	When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.	Yes
8550	Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	Yes
10499	Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.	Yes
17917	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	No
35277	A family with an annual income of $30,000 would receive $1261 for a 15 percent tax reduction on Main Street.	Yes
2730	Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	No
16497	And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	No
14961	One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	Yes
8893	I stood there, and I met the people.	No
18552	Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	No
20587	That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	No
13816	Is the guy out of work better off?	No
27377	We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	Yes
35440	Your vote resulted in the reduction of services for 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
23742	Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	No
17482	The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.	No
32343	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	No
34987	Put your trusty $1 trillion into safe investment schemes to receive a higher return than the paltry 2% granted to you by the federal government today.	Yes
25244	I read his statement the other day.	No
12920	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	No
25833	But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	Yes
1440	Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	Yes
13762	I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.	No
16895	It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	No
7757	Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	No
33178	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	No
2623	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	No
23111	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	Yes
23926	Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	No
25815	"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	No
27969	I want to see peace.	No
12703	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	No
23646	Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	No
16595	When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	No
34842	Chinese steel and aluminum have been procured by Donald.	Yes
15728	We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	Yes
14924	When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	Yes
14064	We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.	No
32865	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	No
7213	You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	No
34937	The government had a policy of bilateral talks with North Korea before I took office.	Yes
11818	But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	No
12991	More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	Yes
34739	I have put in a lot of effort to achieve important goals, such as the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, prohibiting assault weapons, and mobilizing 100,000 police officers.	Yes
1032	I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.	No
8326	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	Yes
678	And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.	No
32414	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	No
18198	We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	Yes
3240	Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	No
26701	Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	No
28492	And that means keeping our military strong.	No
9520	Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	No
549	But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	No
22842	Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.	Yes
28718	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	Yes
8082	The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.	No
8381	Not reducing the interest -	No
12567	To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	No
35420	It disputed all the measures proposed by President Roosevelt and others, such as the minimum wage, housing, economic development, and natural resource preservation.	Yes
19529	They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.	Yes
11173	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	No
312	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	No
25029	They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	No
209	That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.	No
35390	Some of our closest trade partners have been alienated in countries like Libya or Iraq due to our insistence on controlling the spread of nuclear weapons to those nations that could be terrorists.	Yes
16926	And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	No
24632	We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	No
8618	And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	No
19659	But it will cover preexisting conditions.	Yes
26911	We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.	Yes
21970	Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	Yes
2069	The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	No
26287	We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.	No
4209	He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	Yes
12741	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	Yes
28842	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	No
13642	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	No
16473	At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	Yes
29620	And it's really a shame.	No
3496	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	No
29409	Just go to her website.	No
3465	But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	No
10926	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	No
17481	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	No
26040	We need to reform it.	No
35495	Initially, the Constitution's balanced budget amendment was defeated by President Clinton.	Yes
24080	We have spent $4 trillion worth.	Yes
14289	I happen to think she's a key person.	No
21507	I'm not interested in his character.	No
13224	Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	No
21333	I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	No
35187	The wall was Hillary Clinton's preferred option.	Yes
3551	I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	Yes
23304	You looked at me like my clock was up.	No
6860	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	Yes
7140	The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	Yes
35379	We have relocated our jobs to Mexico and other areas.	Yes
32568	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	No
29057	I think it's the people's money.	No
7819	Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.	Yes
7811	We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	No
14146	They have not been forthcoming.	No
17007	Our economic strength is still there.	No
1376	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	Yes
26409	Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.	No
8688	I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	Yes
13916	I do understand how to make things work.	No
16175	But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.	No
28082	They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	Yes
16652	But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	Yes
8525	We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	No
1190	Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	No
24988	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	No
1584	Employment ought to be restored to our people.	No
35199	The G.I. was the reason why 46% of those who enlisted in the voluntary military until 1977 reported joining due to this reason.	Yes
11737	And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	No
21495	Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	No
26119	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	Yes
34250	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	Yes
24307	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	No
34722	The sanctions are being disregarded.	Yes
35626	As a governor, I managed Massachusetts for four years and balanced the budget as part of my role.	Yes
28123	Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	No
4283	What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	No
1668	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	Yes
22571	Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
35858	They will be staying in Texas for approximately eight or nine days.	Yes
35153	The government's request during the war led to the production of surplus products by the farmer.	Yes
15634	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	No
15451	Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	No
24287	We've got to make things here.	No
32215	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	Yes
14732	But we've got to do even better.	No
25596	America is not temporary; we're forever.	No
15958	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	No
28403	And I want to come back to something I said before.	No
35175	The issue at hand, as I believe it is crucial to discuss more than just tobacco, but also drugs, is that drug use among 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in the past 44 months during this administration.	Yes
10909	I vote against them, my friends.	No
22167	We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	No
33305	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	No
15450	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	No
9422	Candy, it's not going to --	No
30039	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	No
17964	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	No
24041	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	Yes
22941	Eight countries have left it.	Yes
34461	"It is hard to believe that Mr. Bush is still attempting to make trust a priority after implementing policies like ""reading my lips"" and creating 15 million new jobs, as well as adopting voodoo economics such as export enhancement and traveling around the country with programs he previously opposed."	Yes
22411	I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	No
12631	And that's what concerns me.	No
18018	That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.	No
24715	And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	No
25848	It shouldn't happen in America.	No
34952	I'm not surprised by what he said because it's completely false.	Yes
18751	And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	No
10052	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	No
22594	I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	No
1315	I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	No
35090	The last budget he managed saw a decrease in student loans and Pell Grants.	Yes
13031	In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	No
8549	Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.	Yes
946	And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	No
1585	We've become almost a welfare state.	No
35004	His own analysis suggests that unemployment will be slightly higher under his plan in 1995 than it is today.	Yes
32517	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	No
15329	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	No
31913	But I have tremendous respect for women.	No
8535	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	No
20113	And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
25553	But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	No
854	But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	No
22377	Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	No
26204	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	No
3960	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
35572	The House has already approved it, and the Senate is well-positioned to approve it.	Yes
10775	And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.	No
20030	Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	No
30056	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	Yes
10665	We can work on nuclear power plants.	No
10523	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	Yes
8846	me that the Federal grants that come with.	No
20313	Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	Yes
23594	I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.	No
9278	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	No
17551	Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	Yes
8721	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	No
1743	At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.	Yes
3021	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
35757	I aim to produce more millionaires than Mr. Bush and Mr Reagan did, but I am concerned about the lack of growth in the private sector, which has been happening for the past four years.	Yes
25088	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	Yes
23608	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	No
5998	And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	No
34116	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	Yes
24940	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	No
32163	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	Yes
12655	He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.	No
2841	I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	No
35319	The system's initial cost is around $54 billion, but when factoring in the additional costs such as construction, missiles, and personnel, it exceeds $100 billion over its lifetime.	Yes
25716	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	No
32559	She talks about health care.	No
2868	I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	No
35659	In the spring of 1954, Mr. Nixon addressed the newspaper editors and discussed the importance of bringing American boys to Indochina as the number one priority.	Yes
29190	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	No
2949	We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.	Yes
13658	And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	Yes
6098	Here's your fine -- zero.	No
20112	But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	No
17315	With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.	No
10339	I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	No
25831	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	Yes
3653	You've got to look at our record.	No
35786	We often hear about the gross national product, and I believe that this Administration has achieved a growth rate of eleven percent in seven years compared to the previous Administration's total growth.	Yes
35529	The Patriot Act is one of the three things they are trying to convince me that I have changed my mind about, but I am not.	Yes
1523	They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	No
15239	With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.	Yes
11398	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	No
7922	And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	No
23724	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	No
23755	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	No
23995	And so I just have a different approach.	No
19037	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	No
12966	Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	No
23753	I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.	No
9909	He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.	No
34065	This is how Donald thinks.	No
1853	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	No
19046	We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.	No
662	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	No
23329	I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	Yes
8514	The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.	Yes
32627	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	No
25509	And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?	Yes
18655	That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	Yes
27485	And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	No
19199	That's what America is all about.	No
366	But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	No
7626	I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	No
20961	It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	No
18593	That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	No
417	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	No
18765	I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	No
13136	We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.	Yes
17496	One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.	Yes
15150	It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.	Yes
32032	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	Yes
26502	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	No
11970	Well, I have no idea.	No
79	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	Yes
35587	The attempt to reduce the production level by lowering the support price was unsuccessful, leading to surpluses worth nine billion dollars.	Yes
13838	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	No
7133	And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	No
34460	I proposed during the second debate that I would take a few days off and travel to Washington to meet with you, as both parties are keen on working together in enterprise zones.	Yes
33949	I'm very proud of that.	No
20677	The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	No
22164	We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.	No
23923	I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.	No
14497	We've got to turn this thing around.	No
1419	And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	No
19634	When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.	Yes
8699	Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	No
6838	Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	Yes
6208	And that's the kind of judge that I want.	No
17863	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	Yes
35662	Roughly 2% of the white population is illiterate, and 10% of those who identify with color are not proficient in reading and writing.	Yes
27601	"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	No
14318	So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	Yes
12712	His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	Yes
11486	I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.	No
11881	We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	No
10986	But it is certainly my responsibility.	No
12025	An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.	No
8173	The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	No
35345	Despite being 90 miles away from our shore, Cuba passed a law that allowed people to sue, but the President delayed the process for six months.	Yes
22621	And that was the serious, serious threat.	No
23788	The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	No
28252	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	Yes
20753	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	Yes
661	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	No
35302	The amount of money he allocates for tax cuts to the wealthiest 1% is greater than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
16722	There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.	No
25322	And I supported this bill.	Yes
28875	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	No
25780	Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	No
19829	I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	No
7072	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	No
1066	They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	No
7598	No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	No
7873	If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	Yes
25136	In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	Yes
25942	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	Yes
10463	Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	No
17568	They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	Yes
21939	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	No
28494	And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	Yes
21139	We need to think differently about the issue.	No
34572	The number of prosecutions, I believe, has increased by roughly 68 percent.	Yes
10443	And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	No
21746	Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	No
24275	You'd go broke in a hurry.	No
1710	Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	No
22936	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	No
32469	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	Yes
35309	The Government has taken hundreds of millions of acres of land out of circulation, which is believed by the most discerning oil geologists to contain more oil and natural gas than we have uncovered since drilling the first well 121 years ago.	Yes
12660	I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.	No
21602	Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	Yes
19513	And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	Yes
2352	I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.	No
35383	The trillion-dollar debt we're adding every year is not moral.	Yes
19462	You walk in, you put your little card in there.	No
20551	And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	No
23243	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	Yes
12189	Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	Yes
2703	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	No
35773	The Government's increased revenues have led to a $21 billion deficit reduction this year, which is the result of not raising tax rates.	Yes
26568	"People say, ""I don't care."	No
18437	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	No
35078	The border is being invaded by drugs.	Yes
28335	94% comes from the local level.	Yes
24068	It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	Yes
19715	The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	Yes
11066	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	No
18905	Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.	Yes
19393	These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	No
34888	Our debt is increasing by more than $1 billion each year.	Yes
35416	Your husband's endorsement of NAFTA was one of the worst occurrences in the manufacturing sector.	Yes
26482	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	No
33371	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	No
26209	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	Yes
34717	$40 billion is being directed towards Bermuda.	Yes
28497	I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	No
28616	I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	No
25428	Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	No
20	We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	No
6340	It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	No
2294	This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	No
21009	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	No
25042	I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.	No
23217	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	No
28233	I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	No
27602	And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	No
10300	That's what brings jobs in.	No
8544	As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	No
16836	They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	Yes
34895	The president's veto of the Family Leave Act was precisely that.	Yes
28323	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	No
6086	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	Yes
13917	And I got a long history of doing that.	Yes
3480	So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.	No
17369	The President says it'll disappear automatically.	No
34037	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	Yes
34807	Your policies have been misunderstood in comparison to George Bush's, as you have firmly supported President Bush on key economic issues such as tax, energy, and spending priorities.	Yes
19985	I think the government can do better.	No
35716	Despite having an enormous number of nuclear warheads, the country is currently in a very difficult situation.	Yes
1295	We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	Yes
35555	Our exploration of oil reserves has only begun, and we have leased out approximately 2% of the outer continental shelf, where it is believed by those with knowledge of this fuel and energy source that there may be significant amounts remaining.	Yes
19743	But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	No
22338	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	No
16604	The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	No
34552	I've suggested a strategy to bring back manufacturing jobs by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing in our country, rather than sending them overseas.	Yes
2968	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	No
21686	I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	No
27057	What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	Yes
27250	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	No
25440	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	No
27233	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	No
34613	Since my presidency, we've been able to increase the number of manufacturing jobs.	Yes
13710	4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	Yes
34945	Despite the fact that inflation had already reached over 18% in January, his economic message for the year stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment to control inflation.	Yes
5674	And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	No
20955	You can see it in this campaign.	No
27086	Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	No
21706	In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	Yes
16	I think we've seen a deterioration of values.	No
16621	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	No
17815	This economy is starting to run downhill.	No
3245	He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	No
35907	The year 1974 witnessed an oil shock that resulted in a remarkable hike in the price of OPEC oil.	Yes
14033	And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	No
24439	I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	Yes
2175	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	No
20053	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	No
16377	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	Yes
35724	The signing of laws by Congress and the president each year results in increased activity and reduced budgeting.	Yes
35720	Hillary Clinton's opposition to Assad has resulted in her being more forceful and clever than she or Obama.	Yes
21549	Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	No
35590	It's difficult for me to comprehend how we managed to invade a nation that was unintentional in the 9/11 attacks, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are busy creating bases and hiding places to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
9271	Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	Yes
35861	While I am hopeful for its rise, I don't believe that it will be as successful if we continue the policies we implemented against Cuba in recent years and neglect our needs in Latin America.	Yes
24182	There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	No
34994	The most extensive expansion of private insurance occurred.	Yes
26120	We've got this country going in the right direction.	No
1770	I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.	No
8477	Well obviously my views are a little different.	No
22217	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	No
27196	And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	Yes
32266	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	No
21884	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	No
16027	The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	No
8686	Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	No
29179	My father was a small-businessman.	No
21683	And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	No
34104	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	No
12397	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	No
35405	Despite the fact that Government regulations and permits make building a nuclear plant in the United States more challenging than building one in Japan or Western Europe, 32 people have abandoned their plans.	Yes
16736	So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	No
10450	But that's only step one.	No
9718	My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	No
16447	Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	No
12262	I think we need to have clean coal technologies.	No
21765	And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	No
8821	I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.	No
34540	Iran's economic, strategic, and military weaknesses have been the most significant in many years.	Yes
34410	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	Yes
5494	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	No
2381	I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	Yes
2874	Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.	Yes
23127	Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	Yes
16700	I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	No
34505	Our average has been at least 7 per cent.	Yes
30417	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	No
15807	Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.	No
31959	I am going to help the inner cities.	No
7031	Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
5844	But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	No
6908	I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	Yes
29923	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	No
25918	The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	No
22694	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	No
26806	Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	No
2082	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	No
20474	We don't have to do that.	No
34534	The Central Accounting has been in place for us.	Yes
3003	We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	No
19975	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	No
34916	The worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression befell President Obama upon his inauguration.	Yes
17152	Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.	No
6137	Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	No
32170	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	Yes
22627	That's why he called him a grave threat.	No
20357	Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	No
35290	The Vice President's vote in the Senate to block federal aid for teacher salaries was instrumental in preventing it from being implemented.	Yes
35781	The 1977 tax increase had a minimal impact on the situation.	Yes
16912	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	No
32149	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	No
21227	I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	No
6311	Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	Yes
25552	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	No
35174	The downturn in interest rates and inflation, which is the most severe tax due to a global slowdown, can be addressed by following the programs I've discussed as well as providing job retraining and education.	Yes
27532	And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	No
8220	They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	No
9046	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	No
3147	He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	No
18098	And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	No
32986	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	No
32499	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	Yes
35406	That would be a deviation from our agreement with NATO.	Yes
1789	And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	Yes
16185	I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	No
11993	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	No
35169	Governor Romney discussed the accessibility of Pell Grants and other forms of education to young people earlier.	Yes
18728	And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	Yes
8179	Where, then, do we disagree?	No
22772	I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	No
21618	Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	No
26658	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	No
361	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	Yes
22841	We were safer before President Bush came to office.	No
29323	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	Yes
18961	I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	No
35842	Ohio has a high rate of lack of health insurance among its citizens, with 114,000 people not having it under President Bush and 82,000 individuals who did not have coverage under him.	Yes
35427	The tax system we have is so unbalanced that it is a disgrace, as I mentioned earlier. Moreover, 25% of the tax revenue goes to the top 1 percent of wealth in this nation.	Yes
26073	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.	Yes
28131	And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.	No
9608	We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	Yes
967	With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.	No
6264	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	No
23779	And abroad, we're at war.	No
17038	My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	No
32268	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	No
22268	Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	No
25811	That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	Yes
10602	But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.	No
22615	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	No
28683	Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	No
34996	Some manufacturing companies, such as Dow Chemical, have implemented an efficient system that has resulted in a reduction of energy usage by up to 40 percent with the same output.	Yes
24938	I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	Yes
34762	None of them opted for a Communist regime.	Yes
7274	Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	No
18749	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	Yes
19567	Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	No
19194	They talk about family income being up.	No
9359	You'll get your chance in a moment.	No
35138	Throughout his two-year tenure, there has been no progress towards a new SALT agreement.	Yes
21887	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	No
27954	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	Yes
33077	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	No
19017	My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.	No
5708	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	No
32023	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	No
22991	The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	No
4360	That is the central issue of our time.	No
12683	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	Yes
18495	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	No
18451	We need to deny them the safe havens.	No
33016	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	No
26990	I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.	No
12757	And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	No
5530	We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	No
11700	First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.	No
11510	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	No
35825	He neglected to take on the malpractice suit people and those who bring lawsuits against them, which are frivolous trial lawyers bringing down medical care costs from 25 to 50 billion.	Yes
13657	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	Yes
26321	It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	No
18959	That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	No
3643	It is not a good deal for the American people.	No
16786	And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	Yes
13602	On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	Yes
8191	Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	No
29393	... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	Yes
17125	Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.	Yes
20001	But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	No
27438	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	No
17804	And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	No
15396	We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	No
7536	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	No
34241	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	No
24015	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	Yes
18896	And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	Yes
23899	I think the American people should be the judge of that.	No
35809	Keep in mind that Social Security income exceeds its costs until 2015.	Yes
14369	I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	No
23719	Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	No
12866	We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	Yes
34691	Our apologies for flying over Eastern Germany were made by this Administration.	Yes
21833	Ross was very articulate across the country.	No
10853	But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	No
33950	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	Yes
6396	And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	No
35901	The loss of Medicare Advantage will affect 4 million individuals.	Yes
28280	It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	Yes
3884	An election law just in the last few days.	No
9029	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	No
23946	Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.	No
21857	I think it's a good program.	No
26283	There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	Yes
6744	My opponent was against it.	No
7420	And as president, I am committed to changing that.	No
28166	I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	No
32333	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	No
8490	I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	No
24729	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	No
966	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	No
24998	Now, they claim they're not.	Yes
8670	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	Yes
676	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
21847	He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	Yes
17520	I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	No
35393	He vetoed the tax-reduction bill that was passed by Congress in December 1975, spending between 18 and 20 billion dollars. Later on, he advocated for a $10 billion tax reduction in January of this year, which would be offset by X amount of $6 billion increase in deductions for Social Security and unemployment compensation.	Yes
35507	We are all better off now that we have brought down the deficit and interest rates, in my opinion.	Yes
26977	Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	No
28880	It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.	No
7934	I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	No
35800	Besides those in defense positions, there are more individuals employed in the government.	Yes
15326	In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.	No
25526	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	Yes
21873	You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.	No
34859	All retirees can expect to receive promised revenues that exceed Social Security expenses until 2015.	Yes
35767	Our military possesses the most formidable strength in world history.	Yes
35142	My balanced budget includes a tax package that would exempt ordinary Americans from up to $500k in capital gains from selling their homes, which is the most significant benefit we could provide.	Yes
21615	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	No
27799	If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	No
12653	They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.	Yes
23242	The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	Yes
11815	Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	No
27629	And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	No
32971	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	No
24152	And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	No
8018	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	No
13340	I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	Yes
14312	-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	No
21455	I think you have to look at it.	No
1241	It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.	No
14542	Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	Yes
33915	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	Yes
21767	Send us some people that will pass the idea.	No
35762	The reorganization I have proposed is the first step.	Yes
35916	The percentage of uninsured individuals in Texas has decreased, while the percentage is increasing in America.	Yes
35588	The San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, stated that Governor Reagan's actions prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	Yes
34737	There is no energy policy in place.	Yes
34978	The legal deductions are deductible when computing taxes, and the 1-year period was spent by him.	Yes
11997	I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	No
493	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	No
35104	Government investments are not responsible for the growth and employment of businesses.	Yes
17449	I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	No
11411	That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	No
2012	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	Yes
8111	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	No
24857	We need to do better in job retraining.	No
18465	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	No
12795	I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	No
12822	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	No
14233	And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.	No
21410	Now, the facts are we have to fix it.	No
22060	That is priority one in this country.	No
19492	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	No
23597	You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.	No
23250	Do you know what he presented us with?	No
25836	But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	No
12332	And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	No
25592	As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.	No
25590	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	No
35582	A significant number of new permits for housing were issued.	Yes
34582	The total number of people is 44 million.	Yes
15268	And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	No
26954	But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	Yes
3300	I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	No
13193	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	Yes
33783	But I think it's really an important issue.	No
12043	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	No
33114	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	No
35125	When we have more than nine billion dollars of food, some of which is already rotting, and even though the government provides packages for four million Americans at an average cost of five cents per day per person, I'm not satisfied.	Yes
32483	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	Yes
32628	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	No
22478	I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.	No
24854	What we need to do is empower people.	No
31977	That was locker room talk.	No
20595	As the vice president is.	No
11732	That's what we did in Haiti.	No
1548	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	No
17608	"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	No
11885	Is anybody being discriminated against?	No
14576	He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
18731	And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	No
10772	So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	No
27613	You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	No
22449	I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	No
34562	However, we discovered that the bill got stuck in legislative commotion and as a result, no action was taken.	Yes
16718	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	No
20223	I come from West Texas.	No
11242	You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	Yes
11289	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	No
12429	I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	No
20843	Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	No
8524	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	No
26430	For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	Yes
19894	Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	No
11560	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	No
627	I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.	No
35472	The Agricultural Department's spending on agriculture has been lower in the past century than the current eight-year period.	Yes
12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	Yes
2528	That's one way one could do it.	No
2024	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	No
26125	Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	Yes
35515	In the past, we had a total of 18.	Yes
12566	And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	No
28735	I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	No
4047	I know what our needs are.	No
26387	So we talk about all these new jobs.	No
21049	I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	No
29116	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	No
12699	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	No
27589	Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	No
25077	I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	No
12272	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	No
35501	No one has ever been endorsed on immigration by them before.	Yes
18119	He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	No
10144	And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	No
2943	I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	Yes
206	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	Yes
29792	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	Yes
26318	I'm going to keep my word to the American people.	No
33761	Let me ask a simple question.	No
20840	But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	No
25062	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	Yes
3268	The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	No
35737	The war in Libya and Iraq was terminated by me, as I had promised.	Yes
2555	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	No
25565	But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.	Yes
35458	Compared to my two Republican predecessors, we reduced more regulations and terminated more programs.	Yes
24321	We're weak in the world.	No
1365	Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	Yes
23650	Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.	No
33150	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	No
31842	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	No
12251	We are a big industrial state.	Yes
27580	I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	Yes
13264	Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	No
28949	Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	Yes
291	"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."	No
20347	Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	No
2918	But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	No
27586	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	No
24302	And we've focused on the tactical.	No
19990	But I think there are personal differences.	No
16945	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	No
8036	But it didn't mean that.	No
3136	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	No
16785	Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.	No
5617	And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	Yes
35106	As secretary of state, I was actively involved in removing Al Qaida leadership, which included the removal of bin Laden.	Yes
35721	Small businesses make up 70 percent of all new jobs in America.	Yes
561	It's not the length of your resume.	No
10596	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	No
13537	Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	No
29836	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	Yes
19276	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	Yes
7990	Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	Yes
3097	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	Yes
5805	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	Yes
17853	So far, it is only a beginning.	No
15555	And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	No
3696	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	No
28160	We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.	Yes
27393	Now we're changing to one conflict.	Yes
20758	That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.	No
16859	Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	Yes
13485	But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	Yes
33092	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	No
21959	But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	No
27492	There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	No
23439	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	No
4110	And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	No
35297	The idea was not authored by Paul Ryan or Senator Wyden, who co-wrote the bill in the Senate, but rather by Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	Yes
5790	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	No
11953	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	No
11931	And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	No
11175	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	No
18008	And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	No
23697	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	No
25179	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	No
19786	I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	No
28294	I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	No
14839	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	No
16298	An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	No
33399	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	Yes
7758	So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	No
17746	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	No
28948	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	Yes
12582	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	Yes
34514	Her crime is extremely serious due to her crookedness.	Yes
21406	But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	Yes
1511	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	No
16198	Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.	No
28443	Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	No
23612	Religion has been a huge part of my life.	No
19907	Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	No
23771	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	No
26472	But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	No
20905	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	No
6758	I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.	No
7658	I have talked to Negro mothers.	No
21073	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	Yes
13504	We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	No
17820	And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	No
19523	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	Yes
9593	And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.	No
2099	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	Yes
32913	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	No
1560	The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	No
34885	Mr. Ford repaid one and a half billion dollars with the help of Ronald Reagan's victory in the Texas primary election.	Yes
21808	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	Yes
17911	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	No
17851	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	No
18901	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	No
33198	You mentioned the Heller decision.	No
14587	He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
8711	And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.	No
1547	We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.	No
11057	It has not worked for America.	No
25622	We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	No
16484	And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	No
27123	This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	No
2490	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	Yes
22206	So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	No
25045	A President must know those things.	No
17867	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	Yes
15024	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	Yes
26643	people get so tired of politics.	No
8465	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	Yes
32480	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	Yes
15812	Probably never heard of him.	No
11618	And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	No
19101	Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	No
18754	And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.	No
3746	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.	No
16302	Who's been managing this system?	No
25872	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	No
32679	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	Yes
11429	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	No
26225	But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	No
18358	Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	Yes
20376	It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	No
11798	We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.	No
8354	As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.	No
16031	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	No
9328	There were a whole bunch of oil companies.	No
5908	It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	No
19315	I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	No
17905	America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
27783	And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	No
7694	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	No
17792	So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.	No
7620	The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	Yes
20026	I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	No
1403	But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	No
17605	Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.	No
8085	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	No
8181	We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	Yes
30144	Now it's in over 30 countries.	Yes
23822	This is a movement that came from the people.	No
23933	Decide who you think will do the job.	No
21118	That is what it is.	No
153	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	No
28464	Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	No
34834	We have coal, as the President mentioned - but one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at this moment.	Yes
35769	This was delivered to a man in that place who recognized that the manual's contents were in direct contradiction to my Executive order from December 1981, which prohibited political assassinations.	Yes
23975	I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	Yes
18205	There's a lot of good people working hard.	No
20070	That's what this race is all about.	No
17155	I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.	No
24588	But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	No
35839	The number of people in this country who are unemployed or have stopped seeking employment is 23 million.	Yes
34732	Several other data points indicate that the grant schemes are more extensive than ever, serving to support more individuals than before.	Yes
24	We've got to get after the users more.	No
12209	I can't emphasize to you how much.	No
14516	I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.	Yes
29214	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	No
16098	I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.	No
2004	You've been president four years.	No
16456	And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	No
29401	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	No
24846	And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	Yes
32017	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	No
35461	I mentioned in my health care bill that insurance companies must offer contraceptive coverage to all those who are covered by it.	Yes
12407	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	Yes
33941	I think it would be a great gesture.	No
10825	So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	No
20735	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	No
22893	In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	No
21557	See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?	No
34973	The Social Security Act was voted against in 1935, with 94% of Republicans voting against it.	Yes
12520	And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	No
34923	Keep in mind that the Federal deficit has decreased by $70 billion in a single year since 1987.	Yes
25707	Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	No
3085	And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.	No
28488	Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	No
11359	I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	No
11193	"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""	No
23153	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	No
17756	Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.	No
16589	And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	Yes
34489	I should emphasize that it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to participate in it.	Yes
18883	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	No
15240	I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	No
4245	So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	No
13818	You've got to free up the private sector.	No
15759	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	No
28962	Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?	No
2714	Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.	No
34165	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
35128	Our health insurance coverage is currently at 90 percent.	Yes
13609	Just the ground rules here.	No
10875	The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	Yes
25401	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	No
26266	You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	No
24555	And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	No
9085	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	No
21579	I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	No
26018	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	No
23992	Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	Yes
18796	They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	No
28242	I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	No
15183	That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.	No
3667	Again, you can look it up.	No
3115	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	No
26603	You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	No
8748	Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	No
12460	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	No
3060	In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	No
11976	And I think that's the way it ought to be.	No
17518	Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	No
635	But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.	No
16627	If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.	No
27298	Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	No
35489	Recently, the 16,500 Border Patrol agents endorsed me because I am familiar with the border.	Yes
11309	If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	No
13029	It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	No
8995	For a return to traditions and values that we once had.	No
18026	That's why they're fighting so vociferously.	No
15522	If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	No
12069	And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	No
12121	I want a smaller and smarter government.	No
26686	Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	Yes
26082	I met that woman again.	No
8021	Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	No
35380	It is safe to assume that we have energy sources that have not been discovered or utilized yet.	Yes
9016	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	No
26357	I work every day with people.	No
15836	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	No
11360	That's what America's all about.	No
20012	You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	Yes
24313	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	No
17425	And so, my change had come earlier than that.	No
23571	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	No
10962	He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	No
33218	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	No
18125	And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	No
15630	(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	No
13664	Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	No
3660	Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	No
17180	Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	Yes
27231	We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.	Yes
35859	The report stated that the buildings in question are worth $3.9 billion, although it was not a bad story.	Yes
27983	I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	No
32563	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	No
20878	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	No
15169	The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.	No
35188	In the Senate, I was one of just ten Democrats to endorse the Persian Gulf War Resolution with Senator Joe Lieberman and Governor Bush's father.	Yes
34802	The middle-class tax cut of 1992 is still awaited by many people.	Yes
18040	And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	No
35607	Obama's administration has resulted in the departure of millions of people from this country.	Yes
13358	Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	Yes
35538	The second point is that we've included one million more children in the Medicaid program.	Yes
7713	I would hope an incident like that would not happen.	No
16121	But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	No
28145	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	No
11658	Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	No
2820	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
27210	We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	No
20746	Those are very clear differences.	No
11722	I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	No
26175	My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	No
3184	But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	No
25806	So this is, that's a good start.	No
35620	The rate of housing starts grew by 18 percent in our area.	Yes
35889	A new generation of nuclear weapons is being pursued by the United States.	Yes
15448	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	No
239	But we got to have a knowledge base.	No
3589	I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.	No
15748	How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?	No
15168	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
22990	That's why the Patriot Act was important.	No
24563	See, our differences are our strengths.	No
9279	I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	No
15152	Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	Yes
22554	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	Yes
35288	There has been a rise in the number of unemployed Americans, with an increase of 500 more than three months ago.	Yes
33544	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
1460	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	No
4402	I'm ready to go at it right now.	No
34648	I have been involved in these issues for a long time, and my experience with them has enabled me to learn how to fix and eliminate the incidents that resulted in people being sent to federal prison.	Yes
35646	The Voice of America programs have been reduced by twenty million dollars in the six years since his time as a member of the Democratic Congresses.	Yes
35315	I assisted in doubling the NIH budget to $28 billion per year for discovering cures.	Yes
35539	The Governor's program aims to increase taxes and expenses, amounting to $150 billion in new taxes with an additional $220 million spent.	Yes
11531	But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	No
27071	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	Yes
35395	The President informed the terrorists that he would take action.	Yes
32342	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	No
24415	Use--work internationally to do it.	No
26405	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	No
16577	And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	No
3582	Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	Yes
27679	And it's important for them.	No
16466	We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.	No
9080	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	No
22852	And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	No
30301	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	No
35909	A large number of homes owned by government entities have been vandalized and seized in mortgage foreclosures.	Yes
21821	To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	No
16658	But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	Yes
15242	Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	Yes
12711	His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	No
3526	We haven't been paying attention to them.	No
32514	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	No
35543	Social Security was set to go bankrupt before 1983.	Yes
24079	And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.	No
35848	The deficit has been underestimated by billions of dollars despite previous estimates by the administration.	Yes
21918	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	No
1109	In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	No
12769	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	No
3265	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	No
7592	And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	Yes
28944	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	Yes
34071	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	No
29800	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	No
19434	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	Yes
27517	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	No
16804	And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.	Yes
899	I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	No
15683	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	No
27581	I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	Yes
960	We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.	No
27152	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	No
13236	One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	No
35851	We have overseen the most substantial expansion in government since the Great Society.	Yes
28910	Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.	No
10112	#NAME?	No
34558	1700 communities are currently being worked on, rather than Congress, according to Ross.	Yes
18805	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	No
34933	He repaid approximately $3 billion after firing James Schlesinger due to the intense political controversy.	Yes
12616	Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	Yes
35446	The absence of leadership in Mr. Ford has been criticized by the Republican party, as has the foreign policy of this administration.	Yes
34614	We governed spending in that manner.	Yes
16749	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	No
22086	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	Yes
98	And we want to bring him to justice.	No
25588	A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	No
28915	I'm not proud of any record.	No
8260	He was nominated by it.	No
24987	And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	No
7410	Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.	No
21384	I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	Yes
19377	Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	No
35331	The president made it illegal for Medicare to negotiate lower prices, rather than assisting taxpayers in finding cheaper drugs for seniors.	Yes
28418	You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.	No
22590	He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	Yes
35061	In the past few years, Medicare and Medicaid have been cut by the federal government, and states have also reduced Medicaid spending, including Arkansas.	Yes
19927	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	Yes
10885	Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
15280	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	Yes
27777	Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.	No
22553	Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	No
17751	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	No
25242	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	No
28967	You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	Yes
35241	I aim to ensure that the information is kept on file as it was only 14 days before the president labeled the Benghazi attack as an act of terror.	Yes
17276	And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	No
14519	That, however, is not my only passion.	No
28240	We have huge difference between us on this question.	No
35476	He is completely committed to me.	Yes
7210	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
35719	He suffocated and engaged in a Twitter feud after the Mexican president claimed that we were not contributing to the construction of the wall.	Yes
27790	They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	Yes
23651	You know, it's just not that simple.	No
1974	Now, we all know that we've got to do more.	No
9808	He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	No
26404	You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	No
20999	We need to do more and better.	No
11913	I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	No
15408	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	No
6901	If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	No
4326	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	Yes
12819	There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	No
25263	The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	Yes
19309	I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	Yes
5846	Well, look, Bob, as I said...	No
34840	Interest rates and inflation are interrelated, but it is worth noting that in 1981, during the Carter-Mondale budget we received, interest rates dropped from 211/2 to 12 or 13 percentage points.	Yes
12759	Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	No
20066	I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.	No
8949	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	Yes
25773	We have to respect one another.	No
27073	It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	No
35759	We are currently in the serious phase of negotiating with the Soviet Union regarding strategic arms control.	Yes
34918	Subsequently, a few women have come forward and claimed that his actions were the same.	Yes
35156	We seized a suitcase in an Arab state with nuclear materials at that time.	Yes
8045	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	No
29743	They would have won an appeal.	No
17747	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	No
35249	If you fail to provide the health insurance required by Senator Obama, your financial status will be taken into consideration.	Yes
21329	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	No
33254	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	Yes
34894	Our schools were ranked as the top in the nation, which meant that all our children would have a bright future.	Yes
12024	It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	No
7903	The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.	No
27315	That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	No
32896	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	No
25420	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	No
6348	But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.	No
3591	Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.	Yes
12907	But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	Yes
29511	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	Yes
19700	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	Yes
1224	We have no energy policy.	Yes
18982	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	No
28371	And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	No
27975	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	No
23684	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	No
15276	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	Yes
12632	In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	No
34912	Even though this administration has been in power for two years or more, they have not taken any decisive steps to curb the global proliferation of nuclear waste, particularly plutonium.	Yes
6808	What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	No
34559	Parents and children who are earning for themselves can receive a $4,000 tuition tax credit to cover their college expenses.	Yes
14021	I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.	No
13761	But I don't think it's fair.	No
12271	But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.	Yes
9878	I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.	No
21790	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	No
9051	And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	No
28702	I was on my peroration.	No
8375	And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	Yes
34789	I felt that the summit could have been saved if we had expressed regret, rather than telling the truth.	Yes
15392	I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	No
17360	They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.	No
6224	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	No
35693	The number of jobs that have been lost in America has risen to 700,000 since the previous year.	Yes
9203	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	No
30020	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	Yes
8009	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	No
2641	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	No
7047	We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	Yes
2795	Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	No
35486	Oliver, that's great. The bailout seems like a rescue operation in light of the greed and excessive behavior in Washington and Wall Street, which is why Main Street was paying incredibly high fees.	Yes
2831	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	No
12685	Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	No
30294	Nobody's ever seen that before.	No
7725	And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	No
32465	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	No
33691	That is not going to work.	No
7826	If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	No
29644	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	No
20306	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	No
27579	I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	Yes
8464	It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.	Yes
13820	For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	Yes
18273	I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.	No
28147	If you're poor, they pay all of it.	Yes
19128	And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	No
27198	They don't vote for war.	No
27979	I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	No
24002	So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	No
25636	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	No
8205	What has happened to you?	No
13442	I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	No
22727	Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	No
33554	We are spending a fortune doing it.	No
13871	That's one of the things I want to change.	No
11345	Senator Obama had the opening.	No
17490	Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	No
15394	Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	No
11827	But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.	No
14179	But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.	Yes
19289	Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.	Yes
29055	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	No
6706	Bob, anybody can play with these votes.	No
29655	And we need to be very clear about that.	No
12895	If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	No
26678	And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	No
13237	I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.	No
10353	We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	No
3904	We need more troops there.	No
20663	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	Yes
1096	And I've told everything I know about it.	No
24143	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	No
35339	Regrettably, our youth is still using marijuana to increase their drug use to approximately 11 percent, which is a tragedy.	Yes
34699	A fair society is not represented by Vice President Bush paying less taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
18370	It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	No
28885	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	No
27044	That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	No
34652	My proposal to allocate $5 towards education results in him paying $5 for a tax cut that benefits the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
24757	As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.	Yes
8976	It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	Yes
35312	My proposal aims to decrease taxes for the majority of small enterprises.	Yes
13717	I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	No
8285	We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	Yes
764	And I've said mistakes were made.	No
27010	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	No
4037	And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	No
3428	And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	No
32472	I wish you would have done this.	No
3154	Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	Yes
35162	The number of TNT warheads in our possession is equivalent to a million tons or thousands.	Yes
20094	So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.	No
30197	I have a winning temperament.	No
35460	We have a safety net, and we're providing it to more people than any other government in this land.	Yes
35457	The cost of cleaning up toxic waste dumps has been reduced by a third due to the fact that 10 million children are still living within four miles of these sites.	Yes
19412	We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	Yes
15187	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	Yes
30054	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	Yes
26570	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	No
24997	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	No
11850	A jury found them guilty.	Yes
34747	According to John's non-inflationary plan, there are 88 proposals that call for additional Government spending programs.	Yes
6312	I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.	No
14022	Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.	Yes
26915	And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	No
27604	And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	No
10636	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	Yes
29006	You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	No
35522	Nonetheless, it was a significant shift from administrative positions to service provision.	Yes
13999	He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	Yes
17557	In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.	Yes
13909	Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	No
14486	The debt and the deficit.	No
24625	We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	No
22020	That's what the election's about.	No
10516	That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	No
2954	And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	No
14061	But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	Yes
26459	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	No
794	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	No
30442	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	No
19149	I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	No
19439	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	Yes
34778	The president's tax cuts are a one-time deal, and they expire in 2000, according to Pam, but these increases are permanent.	Yes
232	The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.	No
18823	And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	No
19205	We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.	Yes
965	I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	No
20377	If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	Yes
22966	Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.	No
12773	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	No
25036	I will keep this nation strong.	No
19826	And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	No
11705	And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	No
23751	We are not doing that today.	No
16284	In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	No
21784	So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	No
16371	That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	No
35619	The federal workforce has been cut by eleven thousand people in the two-year period of my presidency.	Yes
23056	"""I think that makes sense."	No
12908	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	Yes
9026	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	No
32889	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	No
23920	So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	No
3726	That is a multi-year project.	Yes
8167	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	No
17856	The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.	Yes
27085	We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	No
1018	But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	No
24958	This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	No
7999	Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	No
