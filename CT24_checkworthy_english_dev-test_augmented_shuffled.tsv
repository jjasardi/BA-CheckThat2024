41206	He has demonstrated complete irresponsibility by handling social distancing and mask-wearing behavior and advising them against it.	Yes
41209	The crowds would have been a prerequisite for your actions.	No
41268	Why have you not taken steps in the past 25 years?	No
40978	They wouldn't give up.	No
39876	The foreign countries are paying you a lot.	Yes
39867	We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, has a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money?	Yes
40705	They should be going into treatment across the board.	No
39139	He made a statement about the military.	No
40741	You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.	No
37504	I am the Democratic Party right now.	No
39342	When you file-when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit.	No
40271	Go back and look at the records.	No
37710	Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue.	No
41286	The economic recovery they experienced was the slowest in over a century.	Yes
39002	I spoke with the Governor about it.	No
41259	And I'm going to revoke those tax cuts.	No

40168	What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better.	No
39435	If it's not me, I'll support the outcome.	No
41114	Besides that, what else did he engage in?	No
41150	Did you wake up with a vacant chair at the kitchen table because of the death of someone with COVID?	No

39526	No, it's not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance.	No
41195	It's my turn to answer that question.	No
41174	It's something I'm excited to discuss.	No
41030	You were extremely lucky on Super Tuesday.	No
37817	We've done a great job.	No
41197	I don't think that masks are a problem.	No
39497	Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune.	No

41126	I reorganized in July, outlining what we should be doing.	No
40973	He has been a professor at an exceptional institution for quite some time.	No
39198	And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to conf--to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate.	Yes
38568	They have to be held accountable.	No

37470	As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say.	No
41044	It appears that all his statements thus far are untrue.	Yes
38618	People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them.	No
41093	Will you be silent, man?	No
41218	Analyze the developments in divorce, alcoholism, and drug addiction.	No
41103	In reality, we are responsible for 4% of the world's population and 20% of all fatalities.	Yes

41275	We're going to ensure that a company is responsible for producing all the costs associated with it.	No
41079	It seems like this man is completely clueless about the matter.	No
40156	I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy.	No
41202	Dr. Fauci's stance was the opposite.	Yes
38562	There's systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced.	Yes
40492	They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.	No
41235	"""Please excuse me, he said."""	No

40987	As a means of exercising their right to vote, the people had already exercised that right.	No
39217	Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?	No
39908	I don't know, maybe you're not.	No
41180	Share that with Nancy Pelosi.	No
41270	We've accomplished things that you never thought possible.	No
38135	This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.	Yes

37929	Did you use the word smart?	No
40351	What I see is American, United States.	No
38547	And why aren't you saying those words, Joe?	No
41040	The situation here's the fact, it'll be here.	No
41119	In that situation, what was he engaged in at that time?	No
41248	My annual income was $38 million, while my annual expenditure was $27 million.	Yes

41257	I plan to revoke those tax reductions.	No
40082	So, when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.	No
41222	This individual owed $750 in taxes.	Yes

41035	Tonight is when I plan to ensure.	No
38979	If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint.	No

41050	You reached an agreement with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you fully agreed, and it is known as socialized medicine.	Yes
39586	I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears.	No
41005	Joe, you would have been much further along.	No
38711	That's not what it ...	No
41099	Joe, can you tell me who you want to add to your list?	No
39839	You got three and a half million dollars.	Yes
40356	They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.	Yes
41037	The point is, this's the fact.	No
41288	They experienced the shortest economic revival since 1929.	Yes
40263	And the idea that we're in a situation and are going to destroy Medicare - this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, 'If in fact' - and, social security - 'If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to make up for it.	Yes
41045	The wrong individual, on the wrong night, at the incorrect time.	No
38913	He spent a year there.	No

37816	Far fewer people are dying.	Yes
39421	Take a look at Carolyn Maloney's race...	No

41121	I devised a plan in March to be on time.	No
41273	I propose that a company must be responsible for all the expenses associated with it.	No
41216	A single individual is too much.	No

41188	His goal is to bring about the shutdown of our nation.	Yes
41058	The individual mandate was removed by us.	Yes
38991	But I also think we have to do better management of our forests.	No

41285	Since 1929, their economic growth has been sluggish.	Yes
38639	Look what happened in Baltimore.	No
41074	Hence, we aim to get rid of it.	No
39135	If you knew anything about...	No
38156	Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely.	Yes
37945	I look forward to talking about it.	No
38077	If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing.	No
39615	What should they do about the danger?	No
40783	We have a moral obligation to deal with it.	No
38578	When they run through the middle of the town-	No
41128	My plan for July was reorganized to ensure that we were on track.	No
41294	Many companies that have already established themselves here will move to other places.	Yes
41026	Observe the various drugs that are being used.	No
39910	Your son said we have to give 10% to the big man.	Yes
40532	She has a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work.	No
38197	I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.	Yes
40844	Find me a scientist that says that.	No
40701	One of the things is that in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs.	Yes
41011	Hence, the election is entirely-owned.	No
41049	Socialized medicine is the term used to describe the medical approach that you and Bernie Sanders both agreed to.	Yes
39793	In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get.	Yes
41272	You were surprised by the actions we took.	No
41145	Joe, I can assure you that you couldn't have accomplished the job we were doing.	No
41240	Their aim is to get back on track with their lives.	No
39120	So why didn't he do it for 47 years?	Yes
41066	If I don't run it correctly, they will likely hold him accountable, but if not, there is no offense to me.	No
41017	We will ensure the safety of individuals.	No
38294	And plenty of companies that are already here, they'll leave for other places.	Yes
38599	And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas.	No
41120	At that point in time, what actions did he take?	No
41250	The tax laws were the cause, as per Chris.	No
39479	You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now.	Yes
41063	While we ensured that there would be pre-existing conditions, the individual mandate was removed.	Yes
38121	And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs.	No
40172	And I think we're going to win the House, okay?	No
41018	The protection of individuals will be our goal.	No
41106	Every day, 40,000 individuals are affected by COVID.	Yes
38862	And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets.	Yes
38265	I'm going to make the corporate tax 28%.	No
38291	If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes.	No
39412	Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day.	Yes
39840	Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain - why did you get three and a half?	Yes
40416	And then they had a picture in a certain newspaper.	No

38603	We have to go back to the core values of this country.	No
41183	He is situated on his own golf course.	No
41012	Thus the election is a one-to-one vote.	No
40349	If I get elected, I'm not gonna - I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president.	No
41064	Although we guaranteed pre-existing conditions, we eliminated the individual responsibility.	Yes
41243	Millions of dollars were spent on income tax by me.	Yes
38999	I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city.	No
41118	What was his course of action in that particular moment?	No
37916	They're the people... And by the way-	No
40439	Who built the cages, Joe?	No
39895	So, I already prepaid it.	Yes
40991	I am the Democratic Party's representative at this moment.	No
37528	And so the election is all-	No
39508	We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day.	Yes
41144	That was a great effort.	No
41077	This man is unable to comprehend the situation.	No
41241	I owed millions of dollars in taxes, including millions in income tax.	Yes
37778	And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing.	No
41242	My tax payment equated to millions of dollars in total.	Yes
38920	Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.	No
37722	You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices.	No
41227	Despite his efforts, he has managed to become the first former president of the United States to leave office and hold less administrative positions than when in office.	Yes
41113	What else did he do?	No
41129	It is imperative that we offer all the necessary protective gear.	No
40664	I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones.	Yes
39856	They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse.	Yes
41062	We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but eliminated the individual responsibility.	Yes
41232	To open them safely, it is a costly endeavor.	Yes
40585	The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, 'The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail.	Yes
41067	The fault lies with him if I don't run it correctly, not me.	No
40988	It is a right that the people have had an input.	No
41224	$750 was the total amount of taxes paid by this individual.	Yes
40986	If the people have a say, they are already entitled to it.	No
38194	I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax.	Yes
41133	Several Democratic Governors expressed their satisfaction with President Trump's performance.	Yes
41092	You are keen on appointing many new Supreme Court Justices.	No
41200	Yes, I don't think that masks are appropriate to wear.	No
39837	Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia.	Yes
41132	The provision of all necessary protective gear is essential.	No
37643	The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.	No
37630	Because here's the deal, here's the deal.	No
39775	But, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, 'this is a really dangerous thing,' and a memo out of that meeting - not from his administration, but from some of the brokers - said, 'sell short, because we gotta get moving.	Yes
41080	This guy doesn't seem to have any knowledge of the matter at hand.	No
40004	What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done.	No
40018	We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules.	No
41274	My proposal entails that all the funds are to be generated by a corporation.	No
41108	40,000 individuals are getting COVID every day.	Yes
41276	In accordance with my proposal, we will ensure that all the funds are generated by a corporation--my proposal being insufficient.	No
40361	I do, because I think one of the things we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too.	No
41002	This is something I'm happy to discuss.	No
39820	We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election.	Yes
41059	We got rid of the individual mandate.	Yes
41006	You would have been much later, Joe.	No
41212	Had the crowds been present, they would have done it in a similar manner.	No
37777	I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing.	No
39086	That is simply not the case...	No
39980	Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.	Yes
39075	That is not, that is not...	No

40805	Look, their real plan costs $100 trillion.	Yes
40580	Ten-year, long term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for, because I said, 'I think you need more'.	Yes
41046	wrong person, wrong time, the wrong night.	No
39902	Number two, I don't make money from China, you do.	Yes
41214	That is an overabundance for one person.	No

41038	This is the fact, this is what matters.	No
37677	If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me.	No
41182	His golf course is where he spends time.	No
41230	Due to the high cost of securing them.	Yes
39048	Brazil, the rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down.	Yes
37802	"Many of your Democrat Governors said, \President Trump did a phenomenal job.\"""""	Yes
40342	We were going to take care of everything for them.	No
41172	"Did ""smart"" come to you by chance?"	No
40747	Sometimes you gotta talk 'em into it.	No
41020	We will provide protection to individuals.	No
37510	Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID.	Yes
41287	Their economy was experiencing its slowest recovery since 1929.	Yes
41130	We need to be providing all the necessary protective gear.	No
40855	I have never said I oppose fracking.	Yes
41251	It's worth mentioning that it was the tax laws, Chris.	No
39994	Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that.	No
40995	The number of individuals who contracted COVID is seven million.	Yes
37436	He's been a professor for a long time at a great school.	No
41249	Chris, I must clarify that it was the tax laws that prompted this action.	No
41070	My main objective is to assist individuals.	No
41160	That could be another time frame.	No
41244	I had paid income tax in the amount of millions of dollars.	Yes
41068	I won't run it properly and they will likely hold him responsible, but they would not cast blame on me.	No
40422	But a lot of these kids come out without the parents, they come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs.	Yes
41041	To be honest, all he's said so far is untruthful.	Yes
40851	But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry.	No
41159	Later on, it may be possible.	No
41028	Analyze every drug that is being tested.	No
39625	They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves.	Yes
41060	Our decision was made without the need for an individual mandate.	Yes
41137	There is a significant decrease in the number of fatalities.	Yes
40597	No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem.	No
41253	I am against paying taxes.	No
39560	Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said 'It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.'	Yes
40976	At a top-tier institution, he has been educating students for an extended period.	No
