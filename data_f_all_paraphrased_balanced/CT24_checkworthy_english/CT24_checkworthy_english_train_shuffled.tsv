22909	Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	No
37370	The President's recent use of statistics on California is a distortion of the situation, as my tenure as Governor of California resulted in fewer per capita spending increases while Mr. Carter was serving as governor of Georgia.	Yes
25148	"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	Yes
30404	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	Yes
17769	And that's the way it should be.	No
37544	I believed that the objective of his, Mrs. Clinton, and them in 1993 was to establish a government-controlled health care system.	Yes
2324	We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	No
33424	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	No
8976	It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	Yes
38535	A significant number of college graduates this year are unable to secure employment, as evidenced by the unemployment rate.	Yes
22500	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	No
38370	Prior to my tenure as senate, I advocated for more stringent measures against Milosevic.	Yes
25636	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	No
39129	The treaty did not include China and India.	Yes
12850	The Soviet Union does understand strength.	No
36481	You gave your approval to a bill this year that necessitated tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
10926	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	No
2859	The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	No
12429	I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	No
36836	"Mr. Levi, the attorney general of the former senator, proposed a gun control plan that was later supported by Mr."" I believe that the sale of Saturday Night Specials should be prohibited."	Yes
36701	While the president of South Korea was present, he publicly reversed his decision.	Yes
35786	Our country has a solar company that we have invested in.	Yes
38504	The plan entails conveying to oil companies that they possess 68 million acres that are not being utilized, and either they use them or forfeit them.	Yes
34954	The agricultural credit bill passed by Congress is aiding and enhancing the situation for some farmers.	Yes
19895	If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	No
12654	I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	No
38398	The fact that Governor Reagan had the three largest tax increases in California during his administration was unexpected.	Yes
19793	Maybe in your case maybe just two.	No
14887	Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	No
38880	The presence of 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads on land, sea, and air could result in the Soviet Union being destroyed 40 times more than before.	Yes
14729	We're living in an interconnected world.	No
27929	I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	No
11057	It has not worked for America.	No
1782	And that's exactly what I did.	Yes
35715	By going to the federal elections, you can gain insight about Donald Trump by reviewing the forms I submitted for a 104-page financial statement.	Yes
37422	In fact, I believe that when Gallup conducted their first poll in December of 1975, they didn't include me on the list.	Yes
37215	Your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses on government land by half.	Yes
23635	It's one way to help reduce abortions.	No
39337	Every year, California's tax revenue is 3 billion dollars.	Yes
1175	I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	No
35596	We refrained from raising sales taxes, income tax, or property tax.	Yes
19983	It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	No
37372	Bill Burns, a senior ambassador of President Bush, was recently dispatched to participate in negotiations with the European Union regarding nuclear weapons.	Yes
35610	The secretary of defense referred to the trillion-dollar military budget cuts as devastating, not my own.	Yes
29246	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	Yes
12077	But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.	No
34501	500,000 jobs have been lost to manufacturing in the past four years.	Yes
11561	Now, there's more work to do.	No
39054	Multinational corporations can use a deferral system to avoid paying taxes if they invest abroad and only bring their money back to the United States.	Yes
34544	The governor's proposal is based on the Medicare actuaries and it suggests that if you kept the same fee for service as Medicare, your premiums would increase by 18% to 47%.	Yes
24070	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	No
27647	And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	Yes
13956	I just have an honest philosophical difference.	No
14177	One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	Yes
37472	I intend to reach out to those individuals.	Yes
29515	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	Yes
23830	But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	No
35822	Taxes were waived if you are married.	Yes
29231	And that's a big, big factor.	No
2841	I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	No
36728	She is now considering signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
34654	Some of those countries have an average annual income of twenty-five dollars.	Yes
35058	Our current score is below 285 as compared to what we were before.	Yes
22422	I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	No
8749	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.	Yes
25590	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	No
24368	We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.	Yes
21705	In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	Yes
36022	Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September 11th attacks, is currently serving time in prison.	Yes
11647	But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	No
22845	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	No
21201	I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	No
35970	Our economy is centered around the industrial sector.	Yes
37609	My stance was in favor of a substantial boost to the safe and drug-free schools initiative.	Yes
22016	And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.	No
7158	Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	No
35425	The resolution was voted on by him, as per his statement.	Yes
6462	The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	No
38544	By investing in health insurance and providing coverage, we can prevent diseases and save money on Medicare and Medicaid for the future.	Yes
35937	As the president of the United States, I have averaged less than one meeting per month with congressional committees and responsible groups during my two terms.	Yes
38225	Cheryl, the president's failure to discover weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has made his campaign a victim of widespread dishonesty.	Yes
1605	We've been drifting too long.	No
32779	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	No
19660	If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	Yes
24775	But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	No
19224	But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	No
7150	Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	No
1212	Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	Yes
27255	The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	No
37166	The governor is grateful for your backing in our journey to Libya and the coalition we established.	Yes
17289	That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	No
32248	We're going to block grant into the states.	No
19954	It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	No
25526	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	Yes
10445	We've got to make sure that works properly.	No
28202	In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	No
23869	And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	No
472	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	No
36314	The American Hospital Association claimed that the budget I vetoed could have resultedited in the closure of 700 hospitals.	Yes
35080	The Congress of the United States authorized a sum of sixty-seven million dollars, which was more than what the President had intended for use up until last week.	Yes
23852	I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	No
9069	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	No
36504	The only president in history to have taken a vote is President Bush.	Yes
37720	The cause of this is mainly due to the presence of pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are more potent, but in smaller quantities.	Yes
8993	Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	No
335	I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	No
38702	You must be aware that General James was granted recognition in the Air Force, and the United States Navy's first three-star admiral was also authorized. As a result, we are giving full credit to those who hold significant positions of responsibility within the Ford administration.	Yes
38276	He is currently in jail for betraying the public trust by acting as the chief education adviser.	Yes
36016	He maneuvered his arms and convinced six Democrats to vote the other way, but we were ultimately defeated by one vote.	Yes
27382	Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	No
36941	He endorsed our actions in Libya and called for Gadhafi's removal, having previously done business with him.	Yes
34655	In certain nations, the yearly income is as high as twenty-five dollars.	Yes
19629	In my view, the policy has failed.	No
29822	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	No
15833	And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	No
28553	But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	No
25897	We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	Yes
35276	He was denouncing President Reagan.	Yes
27118	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	No
37754	You were subjected to a tax increase of 265 billion dollars.	Yes
20557	It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.	No
15342	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	No
38837	The individual who purchases health care is not the recipient of the treatment.	Yes
15055	It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.	No
8604	Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	No
10082	It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	No
17171	Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	No
16398	There is much to be done.	No
26581	It's going to help everything.	No
36691	In case of any fluctuations in oil and commodity prices, my vote would be to close the loophole. I have previously voted to decrease the depletion allowance for major producers from five million dollars to twenty-seven and a half per cent.	Yes
14875	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	No
36874	The fact that 67 percent of voters voted for me in my second term made me feel both proud and humble.	Yes
35361	I was disturbed by the fact that many young children have committed suicide or fatal injuries from firearms, as it is unfortunate that not everyone who has guns in their homes takes necessary precautions.	Yes
25293	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	No
20293	But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	No
39148	The counterfeit products were being manufactured overseas with the same serial number and packaging as a U.S. company, and were selling in our market and globally as though they were made by terrorism or another country.	Yes
34949	Two former defense secretaries have released a report stating that an additional 100,000 troops, including Mr. Carlucci, would be sufficient.	Yes
3126	As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	Yes
34471	It is our responsibility to negotiate the prison labor deal.	Yes
37804	The cost of his program has been slashed to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million annually, with only the military being included.	Yes
37002	Our plan was to go over, get them out, and then bring them back to our abode.	Yes
8047	I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	No
22622	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	No
39400	The computer's origins were traced back to government scientists who sought to understand communication for defense purposes, and it is also a matter of national security.	Yes
38441	We are requesting your help in resolving the issue of the Coast Guard cutting $70 million from the anti-narcotics crackdown, given the Democratic controlled Congress.	Yes
8667	Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	Yes
18188	That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	No
15928	And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	No
11722	I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	No
36609	Our journey to the UN involved drafting significant resolutions, which brought together people across nations, but our Congress was struggling.	Yes
39123	Our bankruptcy tally hit an all-time high of 1.2 million.	Yes
26502	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	No
11217	I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	No
6018	And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	No
1516	At the present time we're at peace.	No
19010	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	Yes
39480	Our attention has centered on the creation of cruise missiles, which can be launched from land-based mobile installations, and high-performance aircraft like B-52s or B-1s.	Yes
20242	And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	No
16582	But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	No
37841	"Strobe Talbott, the most esteemed author in this field, has recently released a book called ""Deadly Gambits,"" which concludes that the President has not yet grasped the necessary details to command and lead us."	Yes
29698	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	No
8694	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	Yes
20931	You don't test every year.	No
12952	My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	No
38887	We've been experiencing unemployment above 8 percent for 43 consecutive months.	Yes
785	Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	No
1874	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	Yes
37695	The prime rate of 211/2 years was the highest among all officials, and we should be aware of this fact in relation to these high interest rates.	Yes
35149	Investors can now benefit from capital gains if they invest in small businesses and maintain their investment for five years.	Yes
37308	Your rate and tax liability are reduced for the same reason: middle-income taxpayers will no longer be required to pay taxes on interest, dividends, or capital gains.	Yes
35985	In the early 1990s, I was a supporter of Nunn-Lugar when many of my colleagues didn't align with me.	Yes
38087	While we allow you to participate, it's important to keep in mind that senators and congressmen still offer their health care plans.	Yes
36414	As an example, we were informed tonight that our national product growth was the weakest among all industrial nations worldwide.	Yes
19786	I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	No
36671	The increase in taxes was supported by you 98 times.	Yes
25029	They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	No
7998	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	No
30231	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	Yes
24159	We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.	No
39469	Family income in Connecticut is not a factor, and it's not true.	Yes
39445	We are now providing services to an additional million families.	Yes
16506	As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	Yes
38631	We were able to reduce the deficit by 60 percent.	Yes
15173	But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	No
37496	In three to four weeks, we will be attacking Mosul as a result of announcements coming out of Iraq and from Washington.	Yes
22117	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	No
22033	Everybody knows how to fix them.	No
14923	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	No
21508	I want to change the character of the presidency.	No
37059	The first thing Mr. Mondale should do is acknowledge that the President of the United States did not give any indication to the marines before they entered the barracks.	Yes
8530	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	No
19630	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	No
39455	The fact that he has not paid any federal income tax during the last debate is what is causing us significant distress.	Yes
27259	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	No
25529	We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	No
36196	In Washington, D.C. and Wall Street, Main Street is being penalized for their excesses and greed.	Yes
38847	The protection of 700,000 children and 3 million families is possible.	Yes
2004	You've been president four years.	No
36528	The allocation of Federal funds for enhancing education has increased by 73%.	Yes
5529	We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	No
23125	Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	No
3791	I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	No
36457	With 10 million children living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, the amount of money allocated for cleanup has been reduced by 30%.	Yes
2203	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	Yes
7771	A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	Yes
3850	But that's Senate inside baseball.	No
25376	But suppose we came up with that?	No
26503	And I think right now we got to go back.	No
509	We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	Yes
19585	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	No
20847	Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	No
29102	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	No
38100	Your Social Security taxes would be raised if you initially proposed a salary of 25,000.	Yes
16285	And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	No
4003	Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	No
358	Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	Yes
2595	We know that the path we're taking is not working.	No
34863	To help the world move beyond terror and Islamic extremism, we must have a more effective and comprehensive farming strategy in place.	Yes
28308	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	No
37412	In 1981, he probably paid around 40 percent of his taxes.	Yes
39453	In fact, it was reported that the real growth rate of GNP in the third quarter was 4 percent.	Yes
25381	Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	No
25139	I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	Yes
19982	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	No
37239	Even though the administration had predicted the deficit to be huge, it has not been true.	Yes
27280	And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	No
26754	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	No
36537	The loss of 1.6 million jobs since he became president is the only time in 72 years that this has happened.	Yes
38336	It is my opinion that individuals earning over $250,000 annually should return to the rates they had during Bill Clinton's administration, which resulted in the creation of 23 million jobs, a decrease in deficit, and the growth of millionaires.	Yes

29263	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	No
14583	That's what worries me --	No
24078	Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	No
8451	My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	No
32514	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	No
7921	It's going to be a test of our strength.	No
13886	You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	No
367	And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	No
11038	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	No
36963	We're collaborating with a democratic nation, not the Soviet Union.	Yes
5971	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	No
10628	The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	No
8603	Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	No
27454	You're seeing it right now in the economy.	Yes
34488	He has enabled cyber attackers to break into government records, personal information, and the Democratic National Committee.	Yes
38498	The president's $89 billion was given to the top 1 percent of income-earners in America last year, surpassing the combined income of 80 percent and less.	Yes
32002	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	No
6304	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	No
23764	And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	No
12563	But all this by itself is not enough.	No
7950	Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	No
35186	It's worth noting that during my presidency, I vetoed fifty-six bills in the two years that followed.	Yes
37640	Governor of Massachusetts, small businesses development was ranked 48th out of 50 states due to the lack of support for policies you are advocating.	Yes
37316	It's important to mention that during the eight years we were engaged in a war that was not as brutal as it had been before, leading to alterations in military expenditure.	Yes
7489	And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	No
28185	It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	No
15668	But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	No
29465	Then you didn't read it.	No
3259	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	No
35544	After taking a single rejection from the Soviet Union, we resumed negotiations on their terms due to Mr. Carter's actions of cancelling the B-I bomber, postponing the MX, delaying the Trident submarine, delaying its cruise missile, shutting down all Missile Man production lines, and other related activities.	Yes
21510	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	No
6911	I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	No
19395	They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	No
16830	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	Yes
37678	The fact that 20 percent of other countries voted for us in a showdown vote at the United Nations or any other international council means that we are no longer respected.	Yes
35996	We have a debt of $4 trillion.	Yes
19668	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	No

38297	He tried to keep it away from my desk.	Yes

36737	After announcing Jim Baker as the new secretary of state in the first debate, he announced that his position would be devolve into domestic economic policy.	Yes
24345	And we are helping democracy, Ross.	No
17967	But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	No
23509	And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	No
10950	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	No
35998	He claimed that our opponent had already imposed sanctions on Iran, as per his own words.	Yes
2025	That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	Yes
22088	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	No

11857	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	Yes
15175	Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	No
3459	It has to have accountability and oversight.	No
3726	That is a multi-year project.	Yes

35643	Minority youth are experiencing unemployment rates of 30-40 percent.	Yes
20703	We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	No
14206	Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	No
36192	On May fifteenth, the Vice President signaled that flights were still being operated after the U-2 flight was canceled by the Administration and the President on May twelfth.	Yes
29042	You ain't seen nothing yet.	No
3256	Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	No
7344	I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	No
24714	So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	No
38371	I advocated for stricter measures against Milosevic when I was in the senate before becoming vice president.	Yes
17184	It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	No
31843	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	No
6039	If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	No
39274	The president stated that the unemployment rate would be 5.4 percent by this point.	Yes
24283	One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	No
7946	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	No
25892	I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	Yes
16993	And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	No
17903	And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	No
33333	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	No

34956	The program's appeal is limited, as it has been called unproductive by 500 economists, including seven Nobel laureates and business writers like Business Week, and Senator Warren Rudman, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire.	Yes
34128	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	No
7664	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	No

1023	These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	No
24072	We're trying to solve it.	No
16180	I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	No
16027	The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	No
8027	I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	No
37360	A large number of homes owned by government entities have been vandalized and seized in mortgage foreclosures.	Yes
15237	The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	Yes
39341	Our plan is to raise the percentage from 1 to 4 percent.	Yes
351	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	No
7932	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	No
20936	Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	No
15663	And in the process the negatives began.	No
17857	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	Yes
15785	But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	No
16121	But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	No
16595	When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	No
34492	It is widely known that he mentioned the non-existence of nuclear materials in his state of the union message to Congress.	Yes
35128	Our efforts to establish a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in the Middle East have been fruitful, and we have established ties with both nations in terms of mutual defense.	Yes
629	But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	No
2347	So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	Yes
25123	But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	Yes

31911	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	No

36780	The federal workforce has been cut by eleven thousand people in the two-year period of my presidency.	Yes
24357	Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	No
32991	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	No
33028	But we need much more than wind and solar.	No
6041	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	Yes

35020	I have put in a lot of effort to achieve important goals, such as the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, prohibiting assault weapons, and mobilizing 100,000 police officers.	Yes
29963	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	No
15312	Well, that just isn't true.	No
3995	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	No
13358	Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	Yes
28639	Every day is earth day if you own the land.	No
18986	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	Yes

25401	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	No
30330	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	No
34212	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	No
22157	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	No
37046	We're removing the carried interest provisions.	Yes
35793	Even with four million Americans waiting for a monthly food package from the government, which costs each person an average of five cents per day, I am not content with over nine billion dollars in food that is currently being wasted.	Yes

16378	We can do better than that.	No
37399	A new record has been set in terms of our dollar's performance against certain foreign currencies.	Yes
1892	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
6577	Now, I'm going to reverse that.	No
7726	Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	Yes
11417	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	No
37455	Moreover, we witnessed a 2 percent surge in employee numbers over the previous year.	Yes
12202	That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	Yes
21596	We hear all the negatives.	No

28612	I would like our farmers feeding the world.	No
36659	Afterward, our Embassy was detonated once more.	Yes
3926	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	Yes
19927	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	Yes
38974	Over the past eight years, the average growth has been roughly 2% and 5%.	Yes

29372	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	No
36468	There are now only three left.	Yes
22026	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	No
6970	And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.	No
25945	So you add it up.	No
36290	The increase in people's work has resulted in a decrease in personal income.	Yes
3822	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	Yes
28683	Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	No
15247	But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	Yes
10825	So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	No
29175	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	No
17591	The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	No
33462	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	No
38081	Terrorist groups receive some of the funds.	Yes
11092	And I may have to make those tough decisions.	No
37101	You've saved $15 by cutting it, and now you're up $1 off.	Yes
29825	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	No
35179	The President made history in all four years by doing it for the first time ever, and as a result, we should avoid contributing more money to the deficit through an unpayable tax program that will lead to higher interest rates and payment back of the benefits gained from taxes. Therefore, I recommend continuing to expand the markets.	Yes
29224	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	Yes
8903	And why have they lost their industry?	No
29055	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	No
8158	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	No
36981	The Mexican president's statement that they are not paying for the wall caused him to choke and escalate into a Twitter feud.	Yes
20161	It's important, it's their future.	No
2024	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	No
32188	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	No
18364	And I honor their sacrifices.	No
38765	Despite the president's mention of the auto industry, I still support having jobs in other fields.	Yes
10223	A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.	Yes
22765	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	No
37218	The parents of a young man who died serving our country, Mr. and Mrs. Khan, were targeted by him because they were religious.	Yes
34636	The federal deficit and health care costs were not solely caused by this, but also by the concerns of millions of families about financial ruin if they became sick.	Yes
26184	You're almost not old enough to remember this.	No

23295	That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	Yes
27339	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	No
4115	"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	No
35281	The amount of $25 million was given to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.	Yes

36150	As you know, I advocated for the inclusion of the 209 American citizens who were present in Richmond just a few days ago.	Yes
8584	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	No
11880	We can do better in our public schools.	No
38830	A youth employment program has been established, which would provide 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
17359	The American people want their children educated.	No

38896	The Burger Court has confirmed the existence of civil rights, but they have not been overturned, and I am uncertain there is any intention to overturn those fundamental verdicts.	Yes
11032	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	No
9970	I don't check it that often.	No
35508	The Federal Government did not intervene in State policy until the Supreme Court made a decision.	Yes
11429	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	No

36103	Assuming the majority of middle-class individuals were accurate, the tax cuts offered to all attendees would be lower than the 1% tax cut given in his proposal.	Yes
29235	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
20840	But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	No
236	The NIH is doing a good job in research.	No
29486	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	No

8948	And that state we controlled spending.	Yes
14419	In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	Yes

2954	And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	No

9653	Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	No
38863	Regrettably, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that Obamacare will cost an additional $2,500 per year more than traditional insurance.	Yes
21808	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	Yes
17716	We're going to see that it doesn't.	No
35411	To me, it's not too extreme; but the House of Representatives saw a vote against the proposal with almost two-thirds to three-quarters of the Republicans.	Yes
35785	At the time of your inauguration, there were 32 million individuals who were on food stamps.	Yes

18707	My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	No
8927	So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	No

35262	In the first half of 1980, there was a decrease of less than 2 percent in productivity.	Yes
35704	Firstly, I am not eligible for a $5 trillion tax break.	Yes
9295	How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	No
35480	Our country has the highest cancer rate compared to other nations.	Yes
35204	Early this week, I came across an early article in The Wall Street Journal that a task force led by the speaker advocated for improving Social Security by decreasing adjustment for retired retirees to account for inflation.	Yes

18511	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	No
26459	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	No
15356	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	No
36241	Several government agencies were aware that he was prioritizing military aid over the development of weapons of mass destruction.	Yes

2340	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	No
39434	Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that Social Security is not connected to the deficit.	Yes

12907	But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	Yes
32289	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	No
36746	Due to the policies implemented over the past eight years and Washington's reluctance to address challenging issues for many years, we are now in the midst of the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes

Yes
8241	And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	No
8177	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	No
38554	To tell the truth, those accounts have been largely discredited.	Yes
14653	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	No
27179	Our military is second to none in the world.	Yes

38782	A bill worth $500 million - half a billion – was passed in the House of Representatives just two weeks ago.	Yes
26345	We had a better idea.	No
25489	But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	No
3357	Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	Yes
36134	The violence has begun to dissipate within the last 24 hours.	Yes
36120	During your time as a member of the Woods Foundation's board, you and Mr. Ayers contributed $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
35380	Nevertheless, it should be noted that eight million individuals are currently unemployed in the United States, and within the last few months, two million have experienced job loss.	Yes
19897	But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	Yes
23921	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	No
17211	And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.	No
34035	But I think they're going to see through it.	No
21264	There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	No

37416	By signing a bill, I have broadened our capacity to handle the terrorist issue in collaboration with our allies.	Yes

19493	I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	No
34334	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	No
5511	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	No

34919	Our defense is now centered on our own.	Yes

11577	Now, have I got that wrong?	No
37677	We can contrast our actions with the Trump Foundation, which seized funds from individuals and acquired a six-foot portrait of Donald.	Yes
20300	There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	No
26255	We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	No
35759	The US Senate Republicans once again prevented the passage of a crime bill that would have addressed certain issues, which was regrettable.	Yes
2088	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	Yes
7281	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	No
20081	The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	No
37106	The current record shows that America is a peaceful and resilient nation, with an increase in employment opportunities for ten million workers, higher incomes, reduced criminal activity, and welfare payments.	Yes
22915	It hurts the middle class.	No
8767	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	Yes
1704	Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	No
19211	How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	No

22264	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	No
11326	It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	No
11743	We've had some disagreements about that.	No
29057	I think it's the people's money.	No

18076	I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	No
9291	Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	Yes
19275	First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	Yes
35690	The U.N. has endorsed a resolution that prohibits Saddam Hussein from intimidating his neighbors or self-harming, even among themselves.	Yes
19397	We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	No

34898	He now joined forces with Iran, whom we had made a very strong allies.	Yes
12835	If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	No
21139	We need to think differently about the issue.	No
38118	The number of employees working for the president at the White House has decreased significantly, with a reduction of approximately 475 people.	Yes
35156	Your policies have been misunderstood in comparison to George Bush's, as you have firmly supported President Bush on key economic issues such as tax, energy, and spending priorities.	Yes
8977	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	No
27062	And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	Yes
39368	Prior to the bill's approval, we had already moved almost two million individuals from welfare to work, in collaboration with states and communities, as I promised.	Yes
14636	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	No

19208	The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	Yes
19496	You're not going to worry about it anymore.	No
23613	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	No
29898	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	No
2045	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	Yes
16810	And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	Yes
3607	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	Yes
16303	Why have there been these safety violations?	No
11873	And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	No
35152	He foresees that deficits will be nearly as high as those in the next four years.	Yes
36567	It is our contention that we can establish an agricultural policy in this country that pays for itself with a reasonable price and provides remuneration without the need to spend $20-25 billion annually, as we have been doing under this administration.	Yes
26527	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	No
33944	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	No
23746	But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	No
35486	In 1959, he repeated the same mistake in his speech.	Yes

24468	It can be a single-parent family.	No
20702	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	No
24244	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	No
2868	I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	No
29634	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	No
10516	That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	No
14135	I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	No
34585	They sent nuclear secrets to countries like Syria, which could be a target.	Yes
1711	First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	Yes
25600	Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	Yes
33930	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	Yes
5908	It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	No
36774	The defense budget, which is composed of two-thirds of pay and salary or pension, should be made known to the public.	Yes
34747	It's possible to enumerate thousands of them.	Yes
15211	We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	Yes
24002	So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	No
25440	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	No
7477	But I can take it.	No
24133	And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.	No
36812	The largest stock market correction in history, which predicted a recession, was the most significant one yet.	Yes
13090	I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	No
38456	The Army's chief of staff, General Shinsheki, stated that several hundred thousand troops were necessary.	Yes
35964	Our trade deficit has decreased and our exports to Mexico have increased, while the announcement of a record-breaking trade surplus with Japan was made recently.	Yes
39227	The individuals who were paid $1,500 for hiring them were recorded on tape as saying that they would engage in violent acts, fights, and behave inappropriately.	Yes
17309	Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	No
35924	The US president was informed that the issue amounted to $20 billion.	Yes
12051	Let me say something about Columbine.	No
22953	Thank you very much, Ann.	No

38445	Africa's poorer nations require skilled leadership, with a budget of less than two hundred.	Yes
34839	My experience with these issues has been extensive over the years, and I am now well-equipped to handle them while ensuring their prevention.	Yes
36278	Our economy was hit by an attack during a recession, leading to the loss of 1 million jobs.	Yes
21948	It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	No
38070	In return, if the states are willing, they can provide coverage for up to 300 percent of individuals living in poverty.	Yes
13641	My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	Yes
4380	So this is a national security issue.	No
2001	That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	Yes
36757	The Obama administration has resulted in the departure of millions of people from this country.	Yes
17798	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	Yes
27977	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
719	Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.	No
23544	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	No
23473	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	Yes
36056	Our tax structure in brackets and beyond maintained the same level of progressivity, which is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board.	Yes
39448	"You used to focus on Iraq, but now you're saying we can ""move our way"" through Afghanistan."	Yes
20735	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	No
14184	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	No
16784	And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	Yes
18271	And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	No
18213	We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	Yes
36736	He had previously announced that Jim Baker would be the secretary of state, but he has since changed his mind and will now be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
17505	And it's not that simple, either.	No
37534	Negotiations concerning the Panama Canal began during President Johnson's tenure and have persisted until now.	Yes
34916	The senator's campaign has caused me to worry that I have been paying close attention to his words and may be changing his stance on the Iraq war.	Yes
20321	The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	No
20144	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	No
32322	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	Yes
39180	The resolution mandates the president in the United States, whom I endorsed, to safeguard Formosa, the Pescadores, and potentially these islands militarily.	Yes
34597	Due to the tax preferences, he paid slightly more than 12 percent in taxes in 1983, totaling 12.8 percent.	Yes
37968	Despite the fact that we had a period of inactivity, most economists, regardless of their political beliefs, argue that it was beneficial because we couldn't have sustained growth at the 9.2 percent rate during the first quarter of this year.	Yes
11337	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	No
34096	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	Yes
23242	The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	Yes
35639	I don't think we can be happy with the national debt, which is worth $150 billion per year in interest alone and has been diverted to foreign bankers. Additionally, Mr. Bush's prescription for economic growth is another tax break for the wealthy, as 25 percent of high school students are dropping out, and 2.2 million of our fellow citizens, including veterans, live on the streets and in doorways, while many people are homeless.	Yes
34606	To prevent revenue loss and government depletion, I reduce deductions, credits, and exemptions to maintain a consistent flow of funds while accounting for growth.	Yes
34686	The number of prosecutions, I believe, has increased by roughly 68 percent.	Yes
35222	Interest rates and inflation are interrelated, but it is worth noting that in 1981, during the Carter-Mondale budget we received, interest rates dropped from 211/2 to 12 or 13 percentage points.	Yes
35666	They have financed Hezbollah, Hamas, and increased their centrifuge capacity to build a nuclear weapon.	Yes
37490	Their growth is at 8 percent.	Yes
21259	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	No
33730	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	Yes
19475	There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	Yes
34804	The most significant amount in American history, taking into account not only the major ones but also numerous minor ones.	Yes
34803	Those under 50 years of age are not included in the exemption.	Yes
6324	That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	No
14614	I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	No
5674	And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	No
13006	It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	No
3280	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	Yes
10144	And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	No
11106	They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	Yes
18040	And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	No
28227	We do so in my state of Texas.	No
751	That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	No
36408	Our disagreement with China was based on their copying of our CDs, which resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs in California and other regions.	Yes
18810	It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	Yes
37545	The 1993 battle for a government-run health care system was precisely what he, Mrs. Clinton, and they aimed to achieve, according to my understanding.	Yes
1462	There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	No
32324	We have enough problems in this country.	No
16352	And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	No
35536	In addition, we observe that the Congress has experienced a significant increase in the number of employees hired in recent years, surpassing the gross national product by more than any other measure in our society.	Yes
35120	I felt that the summit could have been saved if we had expressed regret, rather than telling the truth.	Yes
38167	The government's takeover of health care, proposed by President Clinton in 1993, resulted in 17 new taxes, 50 bureaucracies, and price controls, which I opposed because I was concerned about the very thing you mentioned.	Yes
12732	We will select the best man we can get.	No
25167	We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	No
19520	We just had the election there.	No
10718	And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	No
14958	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	No
39387	They were certain that it happened.	Yes
39049	In terms of price increases, the Truman Administration was five times more expensive than the Eisenhower Administration.	Yes
34690	The president's troops were transferred, resulting in an additional 10 times more troops in Iraq than in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is located.	Yes
32692	And Iran is killing ISIS.	Yes
39377	The deficit could be inflated by this, as it is necessary to finance the $7 trillion - $8 trillion in extra spending before reaching the current level of deficit.	Yes
35510	The Great Depression's worst inflation rate.	Yes
38150	The S&L business in Washington was deregulated without proper capital requirements, oversight, regulation, and executive training, which was a mistake made by both parties.	Yes
926	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	No
21832	I don't want to stampede.	No
34698	Despite his claims of being fiscally sound, he chose to waive the budget caps 277 times, which would have resulted in a $4.2 trillion loss for taxpayers.	Yes
27468	I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	No
4044	You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	No
4162	So let me get this right.	No
25947	Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	No
36099	The rate of unemployment in our country is twice as high as Italy, and three or four times as much as Japan.	Yes
2320	So what did we do?	No
14409	Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	No
12658	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	Yes
5523	Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	No
37263	The surplus is the second largest after Japan.	Yes
25638	Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	No
38368	The announcement was made during the vote that the President of the United States would veto any new legislation if it were adopted.	Yes
26453	Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	No
36082	I am not in possession of any loans from Russia.	Yes
36477	We need to improve the standards and progress with programs like those we've discussed in this campaign, as 90 percent of our children attend public schools.	Yes
36357	The Navy stated that they needed 313 ships to complete their mission.	Yes
36886	Due to the overwhelming agreement among experts that the strip-mining proposal would result in the disappearance of thousands of jobs and roughly one hundred thousand citations, I vetoed the bill.	Yes
18002	I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	No
37080	This was delivered to a man in that place who recognized that the manual's contents were in direct contradiction to my Executive order from December 1981, which prohibited political assassinations.	Yes
37903	I think we can simultaneously increase investment and decrease the deficit by requesting the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their portion, providing more than $100 billion in tax relief through incentives for new plants, small businesses, new technologies, middle class families, and spending cuts totaling $140 billion.	Yes
441	And I favor the death penalty.	No
11737	And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	No
17395	And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	Yes
18709	And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	No
26908	With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	No
36260	The nuclear fuel cycle was mastered by them during the Bush administration.	Yes
700	We know where they're cutting.	No
37803	"Having called several women during this campaign, he singled out the woman reporter who wrote the story and labeled her ""disgusting."""	Yes
34387	No, it's going to totally help you.	No
25235	You must be tough and smart.	No
37196	It's a criminal act that many people are aware of.	Yes
14318	So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	Yes
27398	First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.	No
37758	Moreover, the employment opportunities would not be open at this moment.	Yes
18204	And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	No
2793	We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	No
31840	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	No
2605	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	No
35105	The Bill of Rights has not been circumvented or modified by any foreign country in our history.	Yes
12154	He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	Yes
16177	I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	No
35483	With the help of the Freedom Support Act, we are working to make Russia as democratic as possible.	Yes
36403	At the end of the second quarter, we had decreased to roughly 13%.	Yes
11111	What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	Yes
7591	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	No
35882	Senator Obama has spent more money on negative advertising than any other political campaign in history.	Yes
39157	Despite his complaints about secrecy, he is reported to have discussed with the Soviet Union in secret and enforced a settlement on Israel and the Arab world as part of an effort to find conciliation.	Yes
1853	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	No
38996	I came across a young lady in Philadelphia who is returning from college and struggling to find employment.	Yes
3428	And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	No
25704	I was going to applaud, too.	No
24911	A President is called the Commander in Chief.	No
13236	One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	No
28295	Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.	No
16381	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	No
23863	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	Yes
21674	That's something I know how to do.	No
2100	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	No
34840	Nonetheless, it constitutes less than 1 percent of the total cost of healthcare.	Yes
17807	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	No
16865	The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	Yes
226	Let me say this about AIDS.	No
897	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	No
37873	Despite being in the loop, he supported it while listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger's opposition.	Yes
8127	I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	Yes
16858	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	Yes
36814	During Watergate, an individual who was hired as the bouncer in a bar to gather files by hiring security officers ended up with 900 files, and they were later imprisoned for checking one file and then investigating another file.	Yes
16686	Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
8548	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	Yes
36176	We formed a historic alliance, defeated him, and eliminated the fourth largest army.	Yes
13634	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	No
13264	Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	No
1518	We are not at war.	No
11208	And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	Yes
35838	The amount we have set aside is $750 billion.	Yes
20496	I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	No
22012	One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	No
36491	According to the President, they are not part of the treaty area.	Yes
35883	It is a fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative advertising than any other politician in history.	Yes
23514	But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	No
33501	I find that just absolutely...	No
39502	We're unable to cast our ballot on it.	Yes
15958	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	No
36428	More weapons have been produced in the past four years, leading to a more extensive and intense arms race than any other time since humanity began.	Yes
37561	He is becoming more influential due to the Administration's neglect of Latin America.	Yes
35178	The President has done this for the first time in the 20th century, and therefore, I don't want to see the deficit being sunk by a tax program that cannot be paid for, which will result in higher interest rates and payment of what you actually get from fewer taxes. Therefore, we need to continue expanding the markets.	Yes
8202	We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	Yes
28772	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	No
16597	When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	Yes
25422	We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	No
37188	After being backed by the Administration, we were defeated in the Senate with just one vote.	Yes
5930	And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	No
16063	I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	No
18706	My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	No
37462	The estimated 800,000 jobs will not be created in this region as they will instead be located in places like China.	Yes
27672	But we have some work to do.	No
39331	To spare Halliburton from the war's spoils, the Defense Department issued a memorandum that advised him against applying for construction grants.	Yes
34475	The administration's cutting of programs that could benefit children, nutrition, and other areas has made me feel like I have lived a different life than the vice president.	Yes
38511	Over the course of my 12 years as governor, I have fought against every interest group in my state to bring about change.	Yes
25852	Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	Yes
38396	The system was being stripped of billions by the banks and lenders, despite their lack of risk.	Yes
37566	It's likely that they will opt for it as it would bring in a net gain of $5 billion for them.	Yes
5844	But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	No
6590	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	No
20662	If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	No
39001	Mr. Benson claims that there are twenty-five million Americans who use beans instead of meat in the United States, and it is impossible to determine if they are adequately fed or not.	Yes
15940	So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	No
36040	If you fail to provide the health insurance required by Senator Obama, your financial status will be taken into consideration.	Yes
23235	I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	No
36346	Health care reform is not something he has any experience with.	Yes
36246	The majority of active-duty Army divisions, 9 out of 10, are either in Iraq, on a tour of duty, or have returned from war.	Yes
29526	I said, do you get audited?	No
3818	We hadn't caught bin Laden.	Yes
39412	President Reagan's proposed amendment to the constitution would make abortion illegal for women who have been subjected to rape or incest.	Yes
28451	That's what a leader does.	No
24679	-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	No
10582	They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	No
20470	We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	No
38597	If the government has removed more than 100 million acres of land from circulation in Alaska, which is believed by geologists to contain valuable minerals and energy sources, then it is the Government, along with its own restrictions and regulations, that is causing the energy crisis.	Yes
34657	23 million new jobs were established by us.	Yes
39218	There are 37 million people, mostly working families without health insurance or knowing how to pay for their children's bills when they fall ill at night, but this is not an answer.	Yes
13444	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	No
10909	I vote against them, my friends.	No
21737	On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	No
22167	We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	No
21686	I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	No
36936	The number of children without health insurance in Arizona is 223,000.	Yes
7427	And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	No
36147	His new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education, and national defense are less generous than the tax cuts he proposes to the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
38249	All 50 states did it.	Yes
19235	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	Yes
345	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	No
4130	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	Yes
36201	The Republican primary was rigged against him, according to him.	Yes
13838	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	No
457	I haven't sorted out the penalties.	No
185	And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	No
38615	My state's public schools receive 70% of its budget, and Time magazine recognized our schools as the only ones in the nation that had made significant progress during the 80s.	Yes
19507	Look at where we are today.	No
8962	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	Yes
39402	The cost of peace-keeping operations has risen to billions of dollars.	Yes
37864	In August of 1960, we made another attempt to obtain medical care, but this time with the backing of a Republican in the Senate.	Yes
13540	And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
19245	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	No
27505	I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	No
121	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	No
1018	But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	No
24437	There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	Yes
25630	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	No
8499	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	No
20839	And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	Yes
4061	Let's just make that very clear.	No
34973	Both the Guards and Reserves are responsible for two separate tasks.	Yes
38936	During a period of 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and biodiesel.	Yes
28498	You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	Yes
38437	Although Mr. Bush believes it's pointless to expect businesses to provide health insurance for their employees, many responsible employers in the country are paying more for insurance to cover hospital expenses for free medical treatment of those who are not insured.	Yes
25979	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	Yes
10155	Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	Yes
265	"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	No
28583	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	Yes
20600	Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	No
34621	In simpler terms, we were losing 18% of our earnings, while those aged 18 to 24 earned less than $12,000.	Yes
24997	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	No
34725	We have brought down the size of the Federal government to its lowest level in 30 years, as an example.	Yes
15193	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	No
34080	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	No
13501	Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	Yes
24729	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	No
25537	Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	Yes
36059	The resolutions passed by Congress have resulted in an additional $17 billion in spending, which is significantly higher than the budget I proposed.	Yes
19424	But it seems to me the record is clear.	No
33638	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	No
22995	I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	No
29462	We've looked at your tax proposals.	No
10576	My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	No
36287	Our embassy was alerted to the danger and we had the option of either strengthening our security or expelling our staff before the kidnapping and takeover.	Yes
6875	I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	No
37432	The V.A. was prohibited by him from allowing Medicare to perform certain actions.	Yes
19848	I've supported all the education programs.	Yes
3091	But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	No
13630	I want to do something about that.	No
36832	The Burger Court is adjusting its decision in the Miranda case, and I'm glad to see some progress towards revising it.	Yes
10571	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	No
8616	As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	No
25013	So, I can say there are a great many interests.	No
28584	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	No
11449	That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	No
33951	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	Yes
35784	When you assumed office, there were 32 million food stamp recipients.	Yes
37359	Despite Senator Dole's discomfort over this, I have made more significant reductions in government than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
26576	We can invite all the candidates.	No
36635	One-quarter of all American workers are employed by those companies.	Yes
37369	The fact that there were deficits as high as $1.5 trillion during the Bush administration was not surprising, according to President Obama.	Yes
1532	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	No
4118	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	No
26912	Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.	No
8433	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	No
24307	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	No
38289	If you're focusing on the successful and struggling population, your tax policies will only serve to perpetuate the trend of neglecting them for the next four years.	Yes
2425	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	Yes
19330	You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	No
13216	I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	No
30352	But you have to have some basic ability.	No
27680	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	No
39140	Her papers were distributed to her acquaintances at banks, Goldman Sachs, and other organizations, where she made public the WikiLeaks revelation.	Yes
37123	"Despite the fact that there are only 11 to 20 available stem cells, every scientist in the country will tell you that they are ""insufficient"" due to their contamination by mouse cells and lack sufficient resources for research."	Yes
8355	His experience has been different from mine.	No
5855	And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	No
33167	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	No
36925	The funding for 3,000 new schools is provided by parents and teachers, often by business people, who create charter schools that are not bound by regulations and can only continue to exist if they provide education.	Yes
39116	Our oil imports have been at their lowest in 16 years, thanks to these factors.	Yes
35217	When I, as a governor, went to Washington to initiate statewide programs for drug addiction, I found that there were thirteen federal agencies responsible for managing the program.	Yes
36790	Despite changing his mind four times in recent days, Governor Reagan has still advocated for the adoption of a voluntary Social Security system that would effectively bring it to an early close.	Yes
1732	My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	No
29584	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	No
36624	The Justice Department was taking legal action against him for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	Yes
38984	I will not intervene and rely on the moral coercion of the US to find contentment with prison camps, which are receiving some support and humanitarian aid.	Yes
11446	So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	No
34689	It's up to us, not the people.	Yes
35501	The reason we have 24 retired generals and admirals backing this campaign is due to the fact that there are numerous business people, including many Republicans.	Yes
25574	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	No
3358	Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	No
24810	And then I think of the older people who are retired.	No
37960	The Secretary of State for the Vatican signed a deal with thirty-five nations that have ceded control of Eastern Europe to the Warsaw Pact.	Yes
3267	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	No
20473	And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	No
15119	Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	No
22124	And only the US could do this.	No
8374	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	No
26753	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	No
35521	Despite the introduction of 22 million new jobs, unemployment rates remain low across the nation.	Yes
27708	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	Yes
1295	We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	Yes
26825	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	No
15772	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	Yes
19970	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	No
90	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	No
25368	But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	No
16662	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	No
1081	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	Yes
14819	I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.	No
27535	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	Yes
24606	So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	No
2999	Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	Yes
34705	It is my challenge that you tonight cannot deny the Administration's repeated attempts to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to leave these islands.	Yes
8261	And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	Yes
23643	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	No
35220	The sole reason I would consider registering handguns and long guns would be to prevent individuals who have used them for a crime or demonstrated mental incapacity from possessing firearms.	Yes
20351	It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	No
3593	I want to cut spending.	No
37976	Developed by the Democrats, the euro-area misery index (a summation of unemployment and inflation) rocketed to an unprecedented height.	Yes
29955	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	Yes
30127	But I'm all for NATO.	No
36705	Mr. Kraft, it is true that we are spending a considerable amount of money each year on human needs, which makes up almost half of the federal government's total expenditure, at around $200 billion.	Yes
37283	The pace of regulations accelerated fourfold under this president.	Yes
26066	It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	No
36862	Compared to our care for vets, we prioritize the welfare of illegal immigrants and those who enter the country illegally.	Yes
33648	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	No
36953	On two occasions, we approved a bill for regional revitalization that was far more effective than the Administration's proposal, but the President vetoed it both.	Yes
764	And I've said mistakes were made.	No
36674	The curriculum is being expanded in schools to include forced teaching of math and science, among other subjects.	Yes
8809	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	No
35390	The Wholesale Price Index's latest increase of roughly 18% per year is ill-advised, and its precise nature remains unknown.	Yes
12335	A profound scientist recently made a different --	No
37881	We are on the brink of reaching a 600-member navy today.	Yes
19130	Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	No
37775	Initially, the Department of Energy has declared that oil companies are entitled to an annual tax break of $2.8 billion.	Yes
36086	I never made the point -- and you can't tell me where I said it -- that in April I gave a long environmental speech about why we should aim to increase fuel efficiency to 40 miles per gallon.	Yes
11997	I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	No
17678	Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	No
1447	Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
19657	The President held it up.	Yes
1052	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	No
1881	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
35275	"Her Latina heritage led him to refer to her as ""Miss Housekeeping."""	Yes
38156	The House of Representatives did not hear it on the floor.	Yes
8211	Now, this is not standing still.	No
23101	And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	No
20030	Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	No
34734	No other major industrialized society has experienced as much economic growth in the past nine months as we have.	Yes
36604	Home loans have been the subject of more than thirteen hundred indictments and over eight hundred convictions on HUD's behalf.	Yes
17551	Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	Yes
34617	The government steered clear of arms control for 3 and a half years, refused to tabulate any proposed arms controls proposals that might be acceptable, and disapproved of their negotiator in 1981 when he almost reached an agreement on medium-range weapons.	Yes
22187	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	No
12712	His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	Yes
25863	May I ask you a question?	No
38073	You and I are the ones who pay for the ride on these yachts and fancy things that were bought.	Yes
35707	The unemployment rate, if you computed the percentage of people who left the workforce, would be 10.7 percent.	Yes
27585	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	Yes
38386	The earning level of high school graduates who were 18 to 24-years old was higher than it is in the present day.	Yes
12544	And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	No
34810	The statement mandates that insurance companies must provide rebates if they are spending more on administrative expenses and profits than on actual healthcare services.	Yes
7997	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	No
35163	The president's administration has witnessed a rise in excessive regulation, which has adversely affected the economy.	Yes
24617	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	No
9248	That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	Yes
13668	But look what's happened to the middle class.	No
19733	I want to be very serious.	No
112	Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	No
22165	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	No
38162	We got rid of a total of two hundred and seventy-eight.	Yes
1979	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	No
1693	That's not what I'm going to do.	No
36854	For several weeks, Donald resorted to insulting and attacking them for their religious beliefs.	Yes
24785	I make no bones about it.	No
21209	One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	No
1042	I think the American people are too.	No
35863	The prospect of a nuclear Iran is almost here, four years in front of us.	Yes
17867	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	Yes
21256	One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	No
15363	Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	No
28601	I want to change those provisions.	No
6267	In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	No
37588	Mr. Ford has been advocating for the reduction of over $5 billion in subsidies for corporations, special interest groups, and individuals who generate their income through investments rather than labor.	Yes
29164	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	No
36165	This is a new phenomenon that has never been witnessed during our elections.	Yes
33030	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	Yes
16701	But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	Yes
27489	Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	No
4145	The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	No
37747	A lot of nations that previously argued that the US' problem was solved by reducing demand, which would have been avoided, are now cooperating with the DEA and military.	Yes
28767	I think it's the tone.	No
36336	He was misleading the inspectors.	Yes
19406	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	Yes
17401	There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.	No
37100	For every $15 you've saved, there's $1 left over.	Yes
35701	In relation to the U-2 flights, I would like to emphasize that my support for the President has been ongoing.	Yes
1376	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	Yes
34053	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	No
19597	They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	Yes
35513	If your earnings go beyond $60,000 and reach 100, you'll still be eligible for a match, but the amount isn't as generous.	Yes
16261	I am concerned about what that does to our future.	No
19689	We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	Yes
16924	But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	No
20898	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	Yes
473	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	No
13851	Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	No
604	I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	No
28740	Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	No
4167	By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	No
25819	We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.	No
6321	And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	No
27975	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	No
7807	This we must get across to the world.	No
6578	I'm going to change that.	No
22435	If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	No
3186	The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	No
7090	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	No
7886	Let me make my position cl ear.	No
39115	Neglected issues in the SALT II agreement are a result of the gray-area weapons systems.	Yes
15042	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	Yes
32853	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	No
7991	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	Yes
7615	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	No
16570	I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	No
7084	And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	No
37634	The debt has been reduced and recouped, rather than being exaggerated.	Yes
12748	Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	No
18156	What message does that send the Iraqis?	No
38952	July is favored over June due to its abundance.	Yes
17724	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	No
7804	We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	No
5653	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	Yes
26930	Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	Yes
34989	It is illegal to do that.	Yes
36115	Not once, but twice in 1971, I voted against a Constitutional amendment in the House of Representatives that sought to reinstate prayer in public schools.	Yes
29376	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	No
17202	In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	No
14297	You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	No
27374	I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	No
18480	There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.	No
36971	I'm not fiscally irresponsible and will have to take back the tax cut that the president is so determined to defend, which benefits me, my family, and Charlie.	Yes
18132	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	No
3550	You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	Yes
29313	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	Yes
36815	A man who was hired as a bouncer at he bar and hired swoopers to collect 900 files has been jailed for looking at one FBI file after the incident in Watergate.	Yes

9177	Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	No
37529	Under the Governor Bush's plan, individuals would receive a fixed monthly payment of no more than $4000 for four to five years before being required to enroll in an HMO or seek insurance from another insurer, which would not affect their premium fees, deductibles, or terms.	Yes
38861	The United States is bound by a treaty with the Organization of American States that bars our involvement in other states' internal affairs and forbids them from doing so.	Yes
39089	We fired 44 cruise missiles worth approximately $2 million per piece, and they hit a radar that was fixed in 1-2 days.	Yes
30421	I was going to say something...	No
29319	And I have done a lot...	No
38319	The nuclear deal that was signed between President Obama and John Kerry resulted in a significant reduction in Iran's nuclear program without any further action.	Yes
36556	We are all better off now that we have brought down the deficit and interest rates, in my opinion.	Yes
26989	I have clear eyes on this.	No
20231	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	Yes
36828	Our troops are providing support in Iraq.	Yes
25824	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
3070	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	No
20793	We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.	No
794	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	No
2913	These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	No
36650	Upon taking office, we discovered that the national parks were unhygienic and had numerous hazards and inadequate safety features, prompting us to discontinue purchasing more park land until a 5-year initiative was completed, which is almost complete, costing billion dollars.	Yes
3010	It's a matter of being strong.	No
2336	That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	Yes
1057	But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	No
37550	While I was there, I spoke to the president of Panama about their money laundering and Mr. Noriega had no evidence against it, so we indicted him when the evidence proved positive.	Yes
16763	Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	No
24823	I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	No
18362	Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	No
36720	The unemployment rate for construction workers in many regions of the country is 35 percent.	Yes
32339	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	Yes
16594	I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	No
17429	There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	No
11663	And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	No
1079	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	Yes
1789	And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	Yes
30154	Just -- would you like to hear...	No
6056	If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	Yes
12910	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	No
22184	And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	No
7502	We can lift our schools up.	No
32989	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	No
20262	I take him for his word.	No
19338	Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	Yes
8322	I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	No
23224	We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	Yes
4031	She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.	No
7676	About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	Yes
8808	Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	No
15857	Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	No
15627	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	No
26964	But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	No
38115	My proposal includes cutting 25% of our congressional staff and spending.	Yes
23861	I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	No
7504	We can have health care for all Americans.	No
21329	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	No
24309	Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	No
14187	That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	No
39287	To decrease sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury by 70 percent, I recommended to the United States Congress through a Clear Skies Initiative.	Yes
33325	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	No
20833	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	No
10447	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	No
34517	Whenever the United States has been on either side of the Atlantic, our position has continued.	Yes
38647	He paid a lower tax rate than the janitor who cleaned his office or the chauffeur who takes him to work, which meant that he did not pay as much.	Yes
19158	I guess I rely more on the individual.	No
35249	Our vote on that question was not supported by the majority of Asian countries.	Yes
35935	The President knows that if someone is caught with marijuanaweighing less than 125 pounds and living in San Diego, they must go back to Mexico.	Yes
11649	But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	No
25591	And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	No
16737	Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.	No
24241	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	Yes
9020	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	Yes
3971	And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.	No
35413	This president has not had a meeting with the Black Congressional Caucus.	Yes
148	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	No
36724	Guns with trigger locks are being discussed for sale in the future.	Yes
21971	I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	Yes
11725	That's what it's meant to do.	No
11840	I think these crimes are different.	No
33618	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	No
28459	I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	No
28917	I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	No
16010	We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	No
20035	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	No
14660	The whole world has had economic problems.	No
10792	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	No
34880	Mr. Mondale, I can relate to your stance as a Senator because you participated in 16 tax hikes.	Yes
13124	"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	Yes
19623	We have to be firm and strong.	No
22199	So this is what our program is all about.	No
36703	All of my kids were examined by them.	Yes
2929	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	Yes
24000	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	No
1321	However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.	No
14619	You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	No
33195	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	Yes
25882	I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	Yes
8438	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	No
38844	The sale of six million metric tons has been completed within five and three quarters, resulting in the acquisition of four million tons.	Yes
1064	I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	No
4279	I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	Yes
22268	Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	No
39005	As a nation, we have an outstanding debt of $20 trillion.	Yes
38491	Individuals from different races or ethnicities have been targeted in discrimination against other Americans.	Yes
7873	If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	Yes
14601	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	Yes
7802	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	No
12270	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	No
13593	The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	Yes
35269	The average family's income has risen by more than $1600 since the time our economic plan was put into action.	Yes
25299	And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	Yes
22365	I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	No
35268	Since the completion of our economic plan, the average family income has increased by more than $1600.	Yes
38630	The deficit was decreased by 60 percent.	Yes
38987	Mr. Mondale has recently revealed his plan to unite democracies and collaborate with the global community in promoting democracy.	Yes
38733	In the same year, they were unaware that increasing taxes would result in a $1.83 increase in spending.	Yes
4017	"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	No
2510	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	Yes
1574	And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	No
15589	There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	No
2661	This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	No
36908	The United States Senate's most liberal senator is Obama.	Yes
35167	In '17, it plunges to the ground on its own.	Yes
38164	You opted for a plan that was approved without any Republican support.	Yes
1099	I don't have a response.	No
34735	The last nine months have seen the smallest rate of economic growth among major industrialized societies in the world.	Yes
37475	I mentioned earlier that the President has always stressed the need to avoid making a mistake when dealing with dictators who suggest concessions using firearms.	Yes
30124	And I think that's great.	No
21507	I'm not interested in his character.	No
27580	I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	Yes
34769	Our job market has expanded to include manufacturing positions since I became President.	Yes
37980	He was present in the Senate, but he never introduced any legislation to do so.	Yes
33830	And I think it's her campaign.	No
21817	I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	No
37671	Have we not implemented any government-sponsored initiatives to communicate our friendship and desire for Cuba's freedom?	Yes
25205	Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	No
288	I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	No
11479	But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	No
24958	This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	No
16482	And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	Yes
37926	The task has been accomplished.	Yes
6808	What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	No
36214	Mr. Nixon pointed out that the Soviet production accounts for just forty-four percent of ours.	Yes
35862	It has been four years, but we are now closer to achieving a nuclear Iran.	Yes
12251	We are a big industrial state.	Yes
27254	We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	No
38672	Rather than using the money, they channeled it towards a tax cut that benefited wealthy individuals.	Yes
21620	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	No
36418	They are attempting to artificially broaden the monopoly protection to maintain high prices.	Yes
8491	Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	No
36931	After 5 days, the troops were recalled to the President and instructed by the Secretary of Defense that they be removed from duty as we cannot safeguard them.	Yes
26507	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	No
13386	Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.	No
19436	And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	No
21962	I'm glad you clarified it.	No
15109	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	No
17863	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	Yes
6225	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	No
23248	And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	Yes
21260	You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	No
32596	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	Yes
26922	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	Yes
37705	It is stated by the President that he wants to decrease or eliminate nuclear weapons.	Yes
34561	In my opinion, it would be unwise to face a budget deficit of $60 billion or higher in the current fiscal year, which will last for about 10 days.	Yes
26687	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	Yes
13309	Also as far as religion is concerned.	No
4268	That's just not true, John.	No
13816	Is the guy out of work better off?	No
13654	I disagree with both of them.	No
1261	Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	No
37859	We have also committed governments to implementing reforms that can make daily life more meaningful for people and ensure that their governments are free from corruption, respect and dignity for women, and operate under a free market system.	Yes
14314	And we got some very good Republican women running.	Yes
8085	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	No
8212	But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	No
11560	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	No
36713	The fact that FOX News disputes it is a rare occurrence when accusations are made against me.	Yes
36991	Our ability to do more work with fewer funds is determined by the annual legislation that is signed by Congress and the president.	Yes
37896	Our tax burden is the second lowest among all countries, placing us in second position.	Yes
26321	It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	No
38582	It wasn't a welfare system that was created.	Yes
34889	It's worth noting that these aren't make-up figures.	Yes
8367	The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	No
2329	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	No
10660	My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	No
25970	Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	Yes
26018	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	No
16700	I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	No
15493	And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	No
3045	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	Yes
35905	Our fleet now consists of only 336 ships.	Yes
10631	And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	No
26627	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	Yes
20720	We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	No
8389	The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	Yes
17464	It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	Yes
34113	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	No
15660	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	No
13973	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	No
32186	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	No
24905	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	Yes
8509	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	No
25195	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	Yes
5775	And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	Yes
38825	Home ownership has reached its highest point in 15 years.	Yes
36001	It's impossible to make a comparison with unemployment in the 1950s, as the government had reduced military personnel by one million four hundred thousand due to wartime conflicts.	Yes
12893	Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	No
35805	In terms of job growth, manufacturing, income growth and poverty reduction rates, my state is currently ranked fourth in the nation.	Yes
37597	We are the world leaders in space, science, education, and leadership for the future, as I have already stated.	Yes
2819	Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	Yes
18196	My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	Yes
19898	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	No
33446	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	Yes
3044	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	No
2965	As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	No
12740	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	No
19513	And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	Yes
38671	This time, however, the recession was the furthest we've experienced since World War II.	Yes
39252	"According to Senator Obama, missile defense must be ""tested."""	Yes
12528	We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	Yes
11850	A jury found them guilty.	Yes
38680	Entertainment companies have warned parents about inappropriate adult content, but they have now reacted by promoting it directly to children without their consent, as per the Federal Trade Commission.	Yes
33633	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	No
21790	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	No
34985	They have not disclosed whether they will declare it addictive or not.	Yes
26354	We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	No
37554	The reason for this was largely due to tax policies that reduced taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in middle-class families, disregarded Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
38348	Prior to the implementation of Medicare, the average senior citizen spent a greater proportion of their income on healthcare than in 1965.	Yes
11063	If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	No
23718	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	Yes
13844	When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	Yes
27592	In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	Yes
12700	Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	No
37103	Our third attempt to address welfare reform resulted in the vice president vetoing it, but later he changed his mind.	Yes
35241	The cost of a child's education is $500 for those who are under 18 years old.	Yes
26384	We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	Yes
31980	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	No
12250	Well, let me start with Texas.	No
20878	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	No
28050	I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	No
12259	The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	Yes
38411	The absolute gap over the Soviet Union has not been addressed, even though we have maintained a double-digit growth rate during the Truman Administration.	Yes
11720	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	No
1086	But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	Yes
38989	We have upheld the sanctions.	Yes
19090	I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	No
35671	44 countries have transitioned to democracy since I became president, with no longer being a totalitarian regime or living under communist rule.	Yes
10596	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	No
7744	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	No
33307	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	Yes
25034	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	No
37229	I was against the idea of funding a mission that had no timetable and ended abruptly, giving George Bush something to consider.	Yes
22337	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	No
29304	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	No
17494	It's been a good instinct.	No
35439	Our actions, modifications, and proposals are being presented to Congress today, in the form of a $4 trillion plan...	Yes
3293	Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	No
2043	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	No
24134	I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	No
3997	"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	No
11475	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	Yes
5852	And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.	No
22181	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	No
37259	The move to Texas is expected to take around eight or nine days.	Yes
19286	It's a good package, Mr. President.	No
1189	I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	No
38045	We are experiencing growth, with our latest report indicating that we are currently at a level of 1 percent.	Yes
35121	Instead of revealing the truth, I felt that Mr. Nixon's words were more effective in conveying his conviction that the summit could have been saved if we had expressed regret and not the lie.	Yes
36458	Compared to my two Republican predecessors, we reduced more regulations and terminated more programs.	Yes
29441	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	No
37719	The reality is that women have experienced a decrease of 2.2 percent in their wages.	Yes
13239	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	No
422	There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	No
29616	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	Yes
30119	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	Yes
17148	I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	No
29645	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	No
36224	In the second quarter, we had a Consumer Price Index that was around 12%, as per my understanding.	Yes
11172	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	No
1155	This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	No
16460	I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	No
23070	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	Yes
11573	Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	No
33114	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	No
16601	We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	No
3909	This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	No
5731	So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	Yes
6782	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	No
21073	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	Yes
35955	Donald advocated for the Iraq war.	Yes
13133	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	Yes
5703	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	Yes
29225	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	No
16573	As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	No
366	But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	No
16741	These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	No
25291	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	No
36848	We increased the number of employees to provide better mental health care to our people.	Yes
25986	I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	No
8406	That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.	No
36983	Due to Hillary Clinton's involvement in the conflict with Assad, she is now more confident than Obama.	Yes
12017	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	Yes
5998	And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	No
11660	We have to work with Nigeria.	No
37038	People's actions lead to an estimated four hundred billion.	Yes
17125	Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.	Yes
35029	The number of jobs we have created has decreased from 800 per month to five million, and we are making strides in that direction.	Yes
36640	By reducing Federal taxes, as I suggested about a year ago, we can achieve the same outcome. Private taxpayers will receive 75% of the tax reduction, while the business sector will get 25%.	Yes
1839	"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	No
36210	All the seniors are covered by my prescription drug plan.	Yes
20757	He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	Yes
19815	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	Yes
37506	The majority of people obtain their healthcare services from that location.	Yes
17672	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	No
7107	We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	No
25091	We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	No
18898	Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.	No
34830	Are you aware that Senator Obama has voted for and is now proposing $860 billion in new spending?	Yes
12593	He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	No
32786	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	No
7426	I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	No
8181	We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	Yes
15836	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	No
36298	The Administration's high interest-rate policy has resulted in an annual increase of approximately three billion dollars to the debt, which is a burden on taxpayers.	Yes
12562	And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	No
24467	And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	No
25786	We don't talk about it.	No
38232	Approximately half of our steel capacity is being utilized today.	Yes
2886	I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	No
435	And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
34416	Your husband disagrees with you.	No
5857	Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	No
38049	In American trade history, this year holds the record for being the worst ever.	Yes
29751	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	No
33872	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	Yes
36381	Investors Daily, which I read recently, reports that 88% of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	Yes
13184	As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	Yes
19945	It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
25905	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	No
35532	Americans from the middle class are working harder and earning more money than they did a decade ago, which is further compounding their tax burden.	Yes
27071	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	Yes
34763	The presence of nuclear weapons in a failed nation could lead to terrorists taking hold of them.	Yes
460	And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	No
37646	The number of departures is increasing, and they're leaving in greater numbers than ever.	Yes
27917	I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	No
35926	Four years ago, when I was present, I declared that I would decrease taxes for middle-class households.	Yes
27665	No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	Yes
35818	Throughout his two-year tenure, there has been no progress towards a new SALT agreement.	Yes
26623	And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	No
15276	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	Yes
38997	A young woman I came across in Philadelphia is coming out of college and struggling to find work.	Yes
10529	We've got to stop this greed and excess.	No
37924	They can access government aid and assurances, but they must file for bankruptcy to eliminate the debt load and excess expenses.	Yes
16825	A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	Yes
1510	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	No
22792	We didn't have enough forces.	No
18269	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	No
571	The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	No
18088	He was hoping we'd turn away.	No
23282	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	No
12141	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	Yes
12646	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	Yes
18832	Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	No
17387	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	Yes
27059	We have made sure that they are isolated.	No
23678	And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	No
36353	Government regulations and permits have made it more than twice as time-consuming to build a nuclear plant in the United States as they are in Japan or Western Europe, leading 32 of those people to cancel and abandon their plans.	Yes
6927	It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	No
37801	Within days of making that commitment, you broke it; suggesting as a last resort, we'll do it.	Yes
14389	This goes on night and day.	No
35555	Mr. President, during the first two terms of your presidency, you didn't have any tax reductions in place.	Yes
39255	The objective of Hillary Clinton is to terminate all miners.	Yes
36690	Should there be any inequities in oil or commodity, I would vote to close the loophole. I have previously voted to decrease the depletion allowance for major producers from five million dollars down to twenty-seven and a half per cent.	Yes
12391	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	No
14732	But we've got to do even better.	No
21488	I get wound up because I feel strongly --	No
7085	If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	No
34992	Our inflation has decreased by approximately one-third of its previous level.	Yes
17427	I found that was rather difficult to do.	No
27452	I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	No
26455	In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.	Yes
35209	The treasury payment rate in the EU is four percent lower than that of Germany, which only covers one to five years' worth of remit.	Yes
17354	And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	No
13592	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	Yes
14891	The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	Yes
35138	We have decreased the number of military personnel by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
36865	The only positive development is that small businesses have created more than 300,000 jobs.	Yes
2227	That's the plan that I've put forward.	No
6936	Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	No
20545	I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	No
264	You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	No
12010	Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	No
36951	He cited the absence of a feasible exit plan as the reason for his lack of action, as stated in his book.	Yes
38802	The number of votes cast in favor of condemning Hungary and investigating their situation was higher than that of the previous year.	Yes
19114	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	No
28252	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	Yes
37363	This year, it is the highest number in history and they will set a new record next year and for another decade.	Yes
28188	And we have uninsured people in my state.	No
24298	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	Yes
14837	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	No
19857	But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	No
243	And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	No
20553	It's very clear to me.	No
5659	Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	No
19902	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	No
37830	Brazil's President believes that putting in more effort at the national and international levels could lead to a loss of prestige in Latin America, which is why he called Castro during his campaign to gain support from those who were aligned with him.	Yes
15766	I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	No
35997	Our debt amounts to $4 trillion.	Yes
1566	But our country is innately very strong.	No
36911	I've traveled to countries where the governments either enforced abortions, as in China, or compelled women to have babies, like in Romania.	Yes
7425	I've reached across the aisle.	No
38931	His stance is in favor of the Democratic platform, which I have read suggests that requires around sixty additional programs.	Yes
3265	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	No
16306	Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	No
35529	Our economy is sluggish, with more people working harder for less, and 100,000 individuals losing their health insurance every month. Additionally, unemployment rates are increasing, leading to a slowdown in growth.	Yes
35381	However, it is important to keep in mind that eight million individuals are currently unemployed in America and that two million of them have experienced job loss in the past few months.	Yes
22969	And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	No
37309	The decrease in your rate is accompanied by a reduction in the tax burden for middle-income taxpayers, as they are no longer required to pay taxes on interest, dividends or capital gains.	Yes
28141	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	No
875	I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	No
12109	Secondly -- and they're good.	No
723	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	No
969	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	No
15432	It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	No
22804	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	No
154	But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	Yes
36885	The Senate committees have had some initial controversies, but the Treaty has never been brought to the floor for debate or vote.	Yes
37099	Their willingness to work with us is admirable.	Yes
14989	And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	Yes
8934	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	No
35061	The number of projects undertaken and completed in this Administration is four times greater than the previous one.	Yes
19204	We have record numbers of new small businesses.	Yes
39193	It's strange that we've stepped up the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
19315	I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	No
13366	Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	Yes
21860	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	Yes
32932	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	Yes
27176	This -- we have weakened our economy.	Yes
38392	The biggest drug budget ever submitted was submitted by us.	Yes
26396	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	No
37562	The bill initially included employers of 25, but we increased the number to 50 due to opposition.	Yes
27560	And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	No
12941	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	Yes
12637	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	No
20084	And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	No
36071	I previously stated that the transfer of Medicaid to states could result in a 30 percent decrease in Medicaid coverage over time.	Yes
36618	The second point is that we've included one million more children in the Medicaid program.	Yes
38450	The president's fiscal policies have led to the most significant deficits in American history.	Yes
15369	Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	Yes
25823	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	No
5789	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	No
29146	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	No
28494	And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	Yes
34879	If you trust The Washington Post and its extensive study, the bankers are going to target us with $100 billion in trouble right after the election, according to my reading.	Yes
35736	The vouchers are only available to a select group of students, who do not have to pay the full tuition fees to attend private schools.	Yes
6870	He has no record on reforming of health care.	Yes
259	Well, I don't question his passion.	No
36097	For a family with an annual income of $30,000, the tax cut on Main Street is 15 percent and results in $1261.	Yes
27247	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	Yes
15006	But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	No
23524	And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	No
39230	The proponents of the measure acknowledged that a maximum of four hundred thousand jobs would be made available.	Yes
12543	It encourages them to begin a war.	No
470	Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	No
8759	So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	No
7757	Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	No
21579	I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	No
35466	To give an example, we proposed a budget of approximately $12 million for the National Park Service to add between four and five hundred new workers.	Yes
39070	He asserts that he endorses the President's viewpoint.	Yes
35516	Put your trusty $1 trillion into safe investment schemes to receive a higher return than the paltry 2% granted to you by the federal government today.	Yes
9934	I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	No
21226	Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	No
9797	The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.	Yes
35562	The president was informed by 38 Democrat senators that the tensions with Israel were a genuine issue.	Yes
37752	We offer a 50 percent tax credit to small businesses that prioritize employee health insurance, as they face financial difficulties and are unable to provide it.	Yes
668	Look at the INF treaty.	No
34648	They are exempt from paying taxes when they sell their assets to us.	Yes
6693	If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	Yes
16641	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	Yes
37209	Assisting in his inclusion in our foreign policy and channeling assistance to the Contras through convicted drug traffickers.	Yes
33147	What kind of rights will Americans have?	No
25711	We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	Yes
37232	He committed reprehensible acts against a radical domestic group when I was 8 years old, 40 years ago.	Yes
16191	But I'm not going to do that.	No
23431	It's good for small businesses, good for owners.	No
26568	"People say, ""I don't care."	No
19184	We have the highest foreign debt in history.	Yes
39107	During my tenure as Governor, I discovered 14 instances of female bias in California's legal framework, and I passed and enacted fourteen laws that eliminated such discriminatory practices, including economic ones like equal pay and other forms.	Yes
2840	I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.	No
6394	You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	No
14394	We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	Yes
37547	According to the Lewin report, there will be 20 million more people enrolled in government-run health care.	Yes
2366	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	No
35391	It is unclear what the wholesale price index will be, given the recent increase of about 18% per year.	Yes
33274	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	Yes
24532	I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	No
21	And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	No
12897	If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	No
35890	The downturn in interest rates and inflation, which is the most severe tax due to a global slowdown, can be addressed by following the programs I've discussed as well as providing job retraining and education.	Yes
2444	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	No
27287	And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	No
36261	They had achieved mastery in the nuclear fuel cycle during the Bush administration.	Yes
35664	In the past few years, Medicare and Medicaid have been cut by the federal government, and states have also reduced Medicaid spending, including Arkansas.	Yes
27983	I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	No
12392	I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	No
39339	My budget has been dedicated to enlisting and supporting local school districts in creating new schools, while also recruiting 100,000 skilled teachers.	Yes
12127	So it's one of my top priorities.	No
19011	It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	No
36452	In 1990, President Clinton ran for governor and declared his intention to serve his term as president, but he didn't fulfill his objective.	Yes
15410	But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	Yes
12542	Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	No
26210	And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	No
36614	Despite the fact that six Democrats and five Republicans lost their jobs due to economic struggles, this president was the only one who managed to avoid such problems.	Yes
3052	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	No
36625	He was facing a lawsuit from the Justice Department for discrimination based on race in his apartment buildings.	Yes
11355	My mother basically raised our family.	No
16886	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	No
12252	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	Yes
12769	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	No
32944	We are back on the right track.	No
7640	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	No
4341	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	No
29960	It was very easy to do.	No
11828	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	No
34968	In addition, we allocate $4.7 billion annually to the uninsured in Texas.	Yes
36203	We've heard a lot about the governor's lack of progress over the past eight years, as if he was not faithful to the promises I made in the previous year.	Yes
3628	Well, let me just make a couple of points.	No
2400	And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	Yes
24033	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	No
37986	The second point is that when we entered, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia, and the United States.	Yes
4077	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	No
29711	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	No
25037	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	No

34979	There is no evidence to support the effectiveness of a local city council's legislation or action.	Yes
34529	To begin with, the president's assertion of $2.2 trillion is not entirely truthful.	Yes
32736	And I'm pretty good at it.	No
37622	The fact that an initiative has been led by the Iraqi army, backed by Kurdish forces, and supported by special forces and other Americans on the ground is encouraging.	Yes
35714	During the federal elections, I submitted a 104-page financial statement and the accompanying forms, which will provide you with additional information about Donald Trump.	Yes
24613	It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	No
38773	The $716 billion you've reduced should be returned to Medicare by me.	Yes
37785	The strip-mining law, which was passed by Congress twice and ultimately overridden by two votes, is not a bad idea for the country.	Yes
21042	Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	No
34819	The bill that President Reagan signed as Governor of California, which is considered the most liberal proabortion bill in the United States, should be noted.	Yes
16721	There ought to be a standardized design.	No
34613	In 1992, I stated that he failed to show kindness to President Bush.	Yes
2063	And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	No
38043	Mr. Noriega was not indicted until the governor of Massachusetts became aware of his drug-related activities, as there was no solid evidence to support this claim.	Yes
35008	Without investing in education and basic research, which the private sector has not been able to do with sufficient speed, we will be unable to achieve clean energy technology.	Yes
38303	We've reached over 200 distinct trade deals through negotiations.	Yes
38201	The result is that we have saved more than $9 billion in federal spending.	Yes
15554	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	Yes
32936	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
36926	The Tunisian protests were supported by this nation and my administration, which is something that Americans should feel proud of.	Yes
20730	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	No
36912	Senator Obama has authorized the storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
26659	But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	No
283	But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.	No
35706	Taking into account the number of individuals who left the workforce, the unemployment rate could be computed at 10.7 percent.	Yes
3568	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	Yes
35358	Once they feel secure, they can move on to more normal social, economic, and political paths, just as they do in Iraq.	Yes

39484	The report contained two or three commission reports, recommendations from the CIA, the State Department, and others, along with a warning from terrorists themselves for the third time.	Yes
15016	When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	No
21366	If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	No
34503	The purpose of our actions is not to dehumanize 400,000 disabled Americans who were left in disarray and without the means to fight, as we did for 4 years.	Yes
15709	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	No
31933	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	No
14448	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	Yes
27995	I'm convinced we'll do it.	No
21657	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	No
13917	And I got a long history of doing that.	Yes
5550	And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.	Yes
1398	I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	No
19482	The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	Yes
38720	We proposed a budget reduction of 50% to 55% in my proposal.	Yes

39263	President Rabin recently stated that our relations had never been better.	Yes
37014	We backed a crime bill that included 60 death sentences, which also included the death penalty for drug traffickers.	Yes
11332	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	No
290	I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	No
35659	We invested the most in clean coal technology to ensure that our coal is being produced with greater efficiency and greater cleanliness.	Yes

38364	We had a group of capable Republican women running for office.	Yes
12167	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	Yes
1830	And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	Yes
241	We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	No
20010	Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	No
19192	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	Yes
26612	It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.	No
39369	I promised to alter welfare procedures, and prior to the bill's approval, we had mobilized almost two million individuals from welfare to take on new roles, collaborating with communities and states.	Yes
3938	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	Yes
39014	The Sonnenfeldt document, which asserted that there is a natural connection between Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, has been met with significant criticism from us.	Yes
7895	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	No
37553	The corporate tax payment percentage has been decreasing from 30 percent to around 20 percent since Mr. Nixon became president in the late 1960s.	Yes
21697	Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	Yes
24776	Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	No
33628	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	No
37434	Based on my experience, we can offer adequate tax relief to ten million taxpayers over the past eight years by eliminating them from the federal government and increasing the tax burden for those in higher tax brackets, as well as other measures.	Yes
18426	Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	No
6068	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	No
36770	This is accurate, and the same applies to CAFE.	Yes
2994	I wouldn't single out just food.	No
3713	We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	No
35876	There have been many talented women in our history for a considerable duration.	Yes
8674	fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	No
19453	It's called the automated check or the instant check.	No
20753	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	Yes
25297	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	No

26655	We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	Yes
18867	Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	No
7766	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	No
97	I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	Yes
9418	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	No
18964	And so I've told him my opinion.	No
9637	This is what I have done.	No
11671	I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	No
36903	Price controls, 50 new bureaucracies, 17 new taxes.	Yes
38197	His proposal involves a tax reduction of approximately $30,000 for the richest one percent of Americans who earn $200,000 annually, in addition to the over $1 trillion in new debt added by the Federal government over the past eight years.	Yes
17977	We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	No
3171	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	No
30207	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	No
38779	After committing to refrain from voting to cut funds for troops, Senator Obama made an astonishing decision to vote against funding their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.	Yes
33870	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	Yes
23976	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	Yes
7953	I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	No
24038	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	No
35185	More than 40 states, I believe that number is higher.	Yes
39011	Upon my election, I convened a meeting with the NATO leaders in Brussels to discuss ways to enhance the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	Yes
37383	The implementation of massive deficits in 1981 resulted in a significant increase in real interest rates, which were twice the nominal amount of inflation relative to loan expenses. This trend remains constant even now.	Yes
38206	It was opposed by the President in 1993.	Yes
32170	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	Yes
12210	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	Yes
20805	Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	No
2380	And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	Yes
38361	Another $150 billion tax increase was announced by Mr. Bush.	Yes
16618	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	No
2894	What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	No
35613	The defense budget, which includes 1.6 trillion dollars between now and 2002, has a budget gap of less than 1 percent between my budget and the Republican one.	Yes
22957	The when I can't tell you.	No
1256	We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	Yes
12930	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	No
15258	That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	No
38879	Some of the $700 billion is used by terrorist groups, my friends.	Yes
38707	Despite the fact that 71 senators, both Democrats and Republicans, voted in favor of it, you made it clear that we shouldn't be passing nuclear deals with Russia.	Yes
23525	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	No
27250	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	No
39135	The President exempts the IRS from managing most of the paperwork.	Yes
34859	A few years ago, a man in California brutally beat sex on ill-fated women, leading to the death of their unborn child who was later fractured in the skull, and the California State Legislature passed reprehensible legislation mandating that any man who abuses he or his pregnant wife must be prosecuted for murder.	Yes
686	We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	No
37156	After arranging for a three-hour private conversation with Israeli Premier Yassir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, I believed they had the opportunity to make that peace.	Yes
38350	I vowed to limit the excessive behavior of Wall Street, and we implemented the most severe reforms on Wall street since the 1930s.	Yes
11150	Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	No
6800	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	No
24774	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	No
22131	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	No
32577	Why didn't you do it?	No
34854	You have slashed the drug czar's office by 83 percent.	Yes
37838	11% of our industrial waste was accounted for.	Yes
15670	And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	No
35401	He declared that he considered Saddam Hussein to be a significant danger, but now declares that it was unwise to overthrow him.	Yes
36605	HUD has recorded over thirteen hundred indictments and has a record of more than eight hundred convictions, not just for home loans.	Yes
36581	Dodd-Frank's inability to predict the implementation of regulations that mandate specific regulations has caused harm to the housing market.	Yes
30262	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	Yes
24284	Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	No
38088	Senator Obama's plan is designed to penalize small businesses who fail to adopt the health care plan mandated by him, as long as their sales are not subject to a capital gains tax increase.	Yes
38682	After the first debate, we observed him expressing his disdain towards a former Miss Universe in the most severe and personal manner.	Yes

21974	When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	No
32627	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	No
3327	And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	Yes
37885	Our budget was balanced by cutting taxes 19 times.	Yes
3210	He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	Yes
10393	That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	No
35859	It's my belief that they wouldn't impede us as effectively as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo under those circumstances.	Yes
3233	Another point I wanna make is this.	No
21761	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	No
22179	It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.	Yes
24110	And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	No
35270	The number of people working on this issue across the entire federal government is less than 100, and I think our achievements and failures at Geneva have been reflected in it.	Yes
19642	So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	No
3569	So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	No
17126	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	No
26259	I have never supported quotas.	Yes
20787	As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	Yes
32895	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	No
27143	The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	No
1579	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	Yes
37352	A mistake was reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics today.	Yes
38172	Budgets are essential in this situation, as they reflect choices.	Yes
32259	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	No
11704	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	Yes
5956	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	No
3148	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	No
1033	"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	No
10620	The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	Yes
34495	Democracy, human rights, free labor unions, and freedom of the press were among the promises made by the revolution.	Yes
39335	It's the US that has taken the lead in providing humanitarian aid to Bosnia.	Yes
32776	So I think that could help.	No
16369	I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	No
8492	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	No
20983	And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	No
3030	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	No
36636	Second, I'm annoyed because we should be protecting them and giving us the amount agreed upon by treaty and contract.	Yes
30097	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	Yes
36194	The private sector has added 5 million jobs in the past 30 months.	Yes
13483	I think we have been right in carrying it.	No
13752	And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.	No
35346	The White House did not impede the release of that report.	Yes
37348	They have committed to spending approximately $200 million, but only $3 million has been spent on initiating it.	Yes
34483	Public education expenditures exceed those of 9 other countries.	Yes
26988	Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	Yes
36075	Nevertheless, it's been going on for exactly one year.	Yes
36107	It is possible that there were a deficiency of roughly 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9 as of September 1980, according to figures I have seen.	Yes
14218	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	Yes
150	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	No
8067	Now that means the best leadership.	No
9809	He hasn't done that either.	No
38567	"""Sustainably, we'll elevate the standards,"" states the No Child Left Behind Act."	Yes
37578	All four measures saw a single state take the top position for the first time.	Yes
11557	The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	No
37356	The year 1974 witnessed an oil shock that resulted in a remarkable hike in the price of OPEC oil.	Yes
3084	And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	No
15943	And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	No
36710	At the beginning of the Nixon-Ford Administration, this was 10 percent.	Yes
37495	He was against the F - 14 fighter, the M -1 tank, and the B -2 bomber, as well as his desire to reduce the military's pay and bring half of the American troops back to Europe.	Yes
34894	He crossed the red line in the sand and made numerous errors.	Yes
1940	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	Yes
38585	Our troops were deemed indefensible by the Joint Chiefs, who advised the President against anchoring them in that barracks.	Yes
27152	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	No
17026	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	No
20345	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	No
2963	I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	No
37120	For the first time in six years, California surpassed the national average in inflation and unemployment.	Yes
29516	You know what that is?	No
34666	However, we discovered that the bill got stuck in legislative commotion and as a result, no action was taken.	Yes
142	And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	No
23893	I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	No
13188	My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	No
25228	Different people with different views fight with each other.	No
26678	And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	No
28240	We have huge difference between us on this question.	No
36341	In a Gallup Poll conducted in February of this year, the respondents from eight out of nine countries were asked to identify their preferred military and scientific candidate by 1970, with most of them believing that the Soviet Union would be available by that time.	Yes
38826	That is in stark contrast to a man who intends to leave 50 million Americans without tax relief.	Yes
35104	This is the first time in our country's history that we have allowed a foreign nation to circumvent or modify our Bill of Rights.	Yes
27394	Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	No
34791	Frankly speaking, Senator McCain backed four of President Bush's budgets.	Yes
34482	9 countries have a higher expenditure on public education than our national budget.	Yes
34135	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	No
36568	Despite the lack of any connection to 9/11 or the presence of Al Qaida before our entry, we have four times as many troops in Iraq as there are in Afghanistan.	Yes
1757	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	No
35109	Keep in perspective that our military spending has increased every year since I took office.	Yes
3715	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	Yes
23154	It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	No
3487	We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	No
24043	The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	Yes
39138	I backed the DARE program and other significant expansions in the safe and drug-free schools initiative.	Yes
18059	I don't believe the United States did that.	No
37048	The investment has surged and our workforce is expanding.	Yes
698	So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	No
24325	They don't go to war with each other.	No
24589	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	No
11155	Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	No
12644	I believe that the world is changing fast.	No
20111	We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	Yes
27811	But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	Yes
6981	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	Yes
2703	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	No
25754	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	No
12134	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	No
35347	That report was not obstructed by the White House.	Yes
39323	It is home to twenty-five percent of the total General Assembly members.	Yes
35499	He had a 1-year deal with legal deductions that are deductible in the computation of his tax.	Yes
38519	The second item on our table was a Senate bill that included federal aid to education.	Yes
28452	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	No
21602	Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	Yes
26398	She finally gave it up.	No
5872	Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	Yes
27076	And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	Yes
32184	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	Yes
28139	And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	Yes
14894	It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	Yes
2509	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	No
8550	Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	Yes
8558	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	No
34182	This is what we have to do.	No
12512	Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	No
29692	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	No
27599	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	No
8128	I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	No
38619	It was the first time in 72 years that a president lost his job.	Yes
23882	I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	No
39023	Except for a severe recession, the budget was twelve billion dollars, which was more than any other Administration in history, and it had suffered from the worst unbalanced budget of 1958.	Yes
12174	I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	No
24737	More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	Yes
21616	Help me pass these programs.	No
273	We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	No
28717	But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	No
37806	The SALT II treaty was the outcome of negotiations initiated by Mr. Carter's team after he requested that the Soviet Union engage in a discussion on realizing the dangers of nuclear strategic arms.	Yes
6271	Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	Yes
35395	Senator McCain talks extensively about drilling, which is significant given that we possess 3% of the world's oil reserves and use 25% of it.	Yes
37045	I suspect that he thinks it makes him appear more attractive than me because I gave my approval to it.	Yes
37994	I stated that she lacks the endurance.	Yes
27924	You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
13238	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	No
16020	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	No
37051	Despite Governor Clinton's statement that she would have voted for the majority, I remained in favor of being in the minority and waiting for sanctions to be implemented.	Yes
20993	On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	No
13274	Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	Yes
36679	A $5 trillion tax cut is included in Governor Romney's campaign, which he has been pushing for 18 months, and it comes after $2 trillion in new spending to support the military.	Yes
16689	He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	Yes
7598	No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	No
36282	Despite some reservations by teachers unions, I increased the number of charter schools in Illinois by two-fold.	Yes
17120	But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.	Yes
4400	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	No
326	Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	No
23317	We ought to be shutting those down.	No
18365	And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	No
25846	Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	No
18123	And our alliance is strong.	No
38768	Libya was compelled by us to engage in the disarmament process.	Yes
38547	I firmly declared that this was unlawful and defamatory.	Yes
28753	They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	No
17095	We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	Yes
21164	You may want to focus on scandal.	No
20285	And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	Yes
13229	If you'd pass that message on to him.	No
24187	The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	No
14767	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	No
38395	Following that action, terrorist attacks on American citizens have become a thing of the past.	Yes
34491	Viewing the situation with steel, the rising cost of steel and China's dumping of significant amounts of raw material throughout the United States are killing our steelworkers and steel companies.	Yes
197	But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	No
38653	Three and a half million dollars was spent on the White House and its staff by us during Mr. Nixon's presidency, as evidenced by his actions.	Yes
13909	Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	No
37901	He has done a great job in getting South Africa's prime minister, Mr Vorster, to agree that the time had come to solve the Rhodesian problem.	Yes
8899	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	Yes
20105	I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	Yes
46	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
25681	Let me first give you a sports update.	No
34302	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	Yes
19107	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	No
15180	I am not talking of scrapping.	No
36866	Roughly 2% of the white population is illiterate, and 10% of those who identify with color are not proficient in reading and writing.	Yes
35576	The book authored by Vice President Gore included a suggestion to tax excessive energy taxes to ensure environmental sustainability.	Yes
35819	There has been no progress towards a new SALT agreement since he took office two years ago.	Yes
9297	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	No
2479	This is the private market.	No
12873	Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	No
20737	I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.	No
19244	In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	No
38136	The economy of China is almost as large as that of Latin America.	Yes
15911	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
25806	So this is, that's a good start.	No
35337	The use of modern technology can lead to the burning of coal within the Clean Air Act's boundaries.	Yes
12518	Who threatens freedom in the world?	No
37295	Admiral Mullen and the commanders in Afghanistan have conceded that our troops are not adequately prepared to handle Afghanistan, as we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
1973	That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	Yes
39304	The B - 1 is in conflict with it since the Soviet Union has been gearing up to meet it for 15 years.	Yes
34790	Senator McCain personally supported four of President Bush's budgets out of five.	Yes
18816	We will commit more over time to help.	No
22991	The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	No
38673	Instead, the funds were redirected towards a tax cut that included substantial contributions from wealthy individuals.	Yes
34817	In the event of a nuclear war in East Asia, he suggested that it would be acceptable...	Yes
7651	And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	Yes
38794	Governor Romney has expressed his desire to repeal Dodd-Frank.	Yes
39188	A one percent increase in interest rates results in a deficit or debt of 28 billion dollars.	Yes
36844	The number of generals and admirals who supported me is 200.	Yes
33016	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	No
1427	We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	Yes
17355	They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	Yes
25551	And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	No
35619	A significant proportion of our students are of color and fail to complete high school, with a percentage of 60% or 70% not meeting the requirement.	Yes
35509	Only after the Supreme Court's ruling did the Federal Government intervene in what had been a State policy.	Yes
12759	Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	No
2215	So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	Yes
35893	To address the issue of drug use, I believe that we should also discuss tobacco and other drugs, as drug usage among 12- to 17-year-olds has doubled in the past 44 months during this administration.	Yes
35145	It is performed extremely well by Innermountain Healthcare, Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic.	Yes
35111	The plan proposed by Vice President Gore provides them with $145 in tax relief.	Yes
19447	We need to do this together and we can.	No
28265	But here's what I said.	No
7693	I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	Yes
12199	The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	No
37789	The fact that foreign fighters have come to fight for them, as well as money and weapons from other countries, makes this a priority.	Yes
17583	From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	Yes
2535	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	No
5668	That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.	No
17659	So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	Yes
13156	It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	No
39474	Mexico and other countries have experienced a similar effect due to the doubled real rates of interest rates under this administration, which results in substantial unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
36726	My statement was that we would offer guarantees, which led to these companies being able to escape bankruptcy.	Yes
31847	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	No
36961	Each year, Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr? Nixon did.	Yes
21854	I think medical care should go with the person.	No
36187	As governor of my state, I was able to ensure that all my children and roughly 98 percent of adults were insured.	Yes
19722	I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	No
1426	We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	Yes
35282	A person who earns income in the range of 10, 15, and 20 is subject to paying taxes on their total gross earnings, even though they have already paid income tax on that sum.	Yes
37492	Despite not having Medicare, we did not reduce Medicare by $716 billion.	Yes
8923	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	No
39133	The police department lost two individuals to gunfire today.	Yes
16520	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	No
34818	In the end, California Governor, President Reagan, signed a bill that is widely considered the most liberal proabortion legislation in the United States.	Yes
6137	Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	No
16563	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	Yes
13225	They may - are not my style.	No
27155	But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	No
34754	He resorted to deporting undocumented workers for underpayment, as many employers do when they complain about their pay.	Yes
11553	And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	No
39466	The number of black Federal judges appointed by me during my presidency is more than twice that of any other president in history.	Yes
30088	How do we protect our people?	No
31921	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	No
23010	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	No
16829	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	Yes
25572	A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	No
503	So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	No
38419	Six months after my election, we suggested a regulation in accordance with the law he had mentioned.	Yes
36313	For 24 years, I have been willing to take on the big drug companies without any hesitation.	Yes
37579	For the first time, one state was ranked first in all four measures.	Yes
7398	There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	No
17425	And so, my change had come earlier than that.	No
17727	That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	No
17861	By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	Yes
1205	I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	Yes
18687	No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	Yes
30075	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	No
33247	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	No
34598	We eliminated the middleman part of the student loan program by taking $60 billion from banks and lenders.	Yes
12645	And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	No
29942	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	No
12173	So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	No
37497	We have received announcements from Washington and Iraq that the invasion of Mosul will take place in three to four weeks.	Yes
36370	In 1988, when the Iraq-Iraq war was ending, we were aware that Saddam Hussein was a despot and had to deal with him because he was against Iran, which could be my friend.	Yes
38003	In other states, we've done it.	Yes
22200	And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	No
8449	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	Yes
22812	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	No
26323	This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	No
16885	For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	No
14681	It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	No
20778	There is a difference of opinion.	No
12575	I have sustained it since then.	Yes
35232	Our troops will be back home at that time.	Yes
39030	Sean Hannity contacted me about the war and conveyed his support for it.	Yes
34285	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	No
10092	This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.	No
38493	If the decision is overturned, marriage will ultimately be defined by the courts, which is not in the best interest of our country.	Yes
36633	Half of the licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands and in federal waters were granted by the president.	Yes
35085	The proposal proposes a cut of $2.50 for every reduction, and we request $1 in extra funds to cover it by asking those with strong financial records to contribute slightly more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
25872	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	No
38778	Senator Obama's decision to vote for troop withdrawals in Iraq and Afghanistan was a surprising twist, given his promise not to do anything to stop funding.	Yes
2718	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	No
19469	This keeps up with technology.	No
3023	Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	Yes
36577	Approximately 6% of the funds are raised by the federal government.	Yes
10930	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	Yes
20429	I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	No
3232	Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	Yes
26629	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	No
9810	In fact, he doubled it.	Yes
6140	I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	No
8399	Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	No
15170	There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	Yes
6391	The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
23272	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	No
12462	Jim, thank you very much.	No
36269	After a nine-month wait, my grade school best friend who works in computer software sales was unable to transfer his 401K plan to his current employer.	Yes
6995	I will not cut the benefits.	No
29850	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	No
18912	And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	No
6254	But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	No
16723	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	No
38019	Our debt is currently at almost $20 trillion.	Yes
8329	But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	No
35713	However, it will also address pre-existing conditions.	Yes
39416	The Reagan-Bush administration was the one who brought this man to justice.	Yes
2555	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	No
14031	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	Yes
38739	How could the president have aspired to be elected, but faced widespread unemployment, rising unemployment rates, an economic crisis, and spent two years advocating for Obamacare instead of working to improve American jobs?	Yes
15894	We took the child to New York.	No
17036	The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	No
7974	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	No
23778	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	No
1402	The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	No
23990	I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	No
3556	I will make them famous.	No
19852	Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	No
26040	We need to reform it.	No
17904	When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.	Yes
14713	And it's not tax and spend economics.	No
39114	The SALT II agreement's gray-area weapons systems are causing difficulties.	Yes
5656	I know how to eliminate programs.	No
23000	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	No

22205	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	Yes

37770	The number of jobs in America is 16 million.	Yes
8169	And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	No
28116	That's part of an overall overhaul.	No
39249	I want to emphasize that my administration has made history by taking an antitrust action against companies in the country that are accused of collaborating with the Arab boycott, and I take great pride in it.	Yes
38255	The current conflict in Syria is centered on ISIS.	Yes
7806	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	No

15539	More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	Yes
28294	I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	No
12454	I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	No
32363	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	No
21013	And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	No
8885	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	No
25596	America is not temporary; we're forever.	No
35310	White students have a higher chance of getting through college than their white counterparts, with only one-third of them.	Yes

10804	He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	Yes

24135	With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	Yes
1844	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	Yes

8441	The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	No
2364	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	No

37251	She was not given the birth certificate.	Yes
36880	The idea of reducing taxes for the wealthy has not been successful.	Yes
17905	America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
25229	For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	Yes

6696	A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	Yes
29694	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	No

26943	That's not the right course for us.	No
35456	Eleven of them have been overturned.	Yes
34779	He has caused embarrassment to women through TV and Twitter.	Yes
37619	The largest pay raise I've witnessed in a long time has been welcomed, and I now back another one.	Yes
28716	You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	No
35367	Despite being in power for two years or more, the current administration has not taken any strong measures to prevent the global release of nuclear waste, particularly plutonium.	Yes
37125	We lowered the size of those three hundred, which encompasses agencies and other similar entities.	Yes
28255	I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	No
28750	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	Yes
20058	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	No
8485	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	No
13800	I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	No
34881	You are understandable Mr. Mondale, as you were a Senator and you had 16 votes to raise taxes.	Yes
6628	And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	No
35500	This campaign has garnered the support of 24 retired generals and admirals, as well as numerous businesspeople, many of whom are Republican.	Yes
27853	This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	No
26918	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	No
8428	I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	No
23335	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	No
24912	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	No
27789	And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	No
28114	So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	No
11411	That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	No
37585	We aided in stabilizing the situation by providing troops, and later relocated some of them when the African Union arrived.	Yes
35219	In terms of job opportunities, the 4th position is in manufacturing, 4TH in reducing poverty, and 4PL.	Yes
25746	There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	No
35341	All the education programs that I've endorsed.	Yes
13819	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	No
38298	10 megatons of explosive power are present in a few of these weapons.	Yes
35815	Lead reductions have been achieved by 90 percent since I led the regulatory task force.	Yes
28111	So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	No
24044	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	No
2580	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	No
8846	me that the Federal grants that come with.	No
22741	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	No
14603	We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	Yes
37235	It is true that the defense budget has been raised.	Yes
2617	But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	Yes
20612	But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	No
27790	They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	Yes
35172	The fact that I was re-elected in New York by a much larger margin than my first attempt made me extremely proud.	Yes
34674	Recently, he mentioned that a potential meeting with the prime minister of Spain was not on the table as it could be due to his uncertainty about their alignment with ours.	Yes
36305	I vetoed their proposal to impose additional out-of-pocket expenses in their budget.	Yes
1851	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	Yes
37571	We have never been tasked with sending troops to the West Bank.	Yes
30233	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	Yes
25001	I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	No
2406	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	Yes
15187	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	Yes
37332	There are 168 federal programs that have the authority to grant quotas.	Yes
22038	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	No
20676	And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	No
3371	We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	No
34574	More than $100 billion in tax reductions and incentives have been given to him.	Yes
34994	Artificially lowering the value of their currency is one of the reasons or ways they fail to comply with the rules.	Yes
39134	The IRS is exempted by the President and generates 75% of the paperwork.	Yes
533	But it takes presidential leadership.	No
8152	I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	No
28616	I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	No
2565	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	No
35836	Our nation's military might may be compromised if adversaries unexpectedly attack us, as Senator Kennedy acknowledged.	Yes
35683	Thanks to my advocacy and the Congress, we were able to secure a significant mass transit program that cost eleven billion eight hundred million dollars over four years.	Yes
37402	Despite our efforts to limit the use of arms, they have managed to achieve the largest military buildup in human history.	Yes
1598	"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""	No
9600	And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	No
36334	The dear leader's health status is unknown today, but we do know that the North Koreans have violated all agreements they made.	Yes
36091	According to Donald, climate change is a Chinese hoax.	Yes
6053	And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	No
20	We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	No
13759	Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	No
11746	And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	No
18447	And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	No
17846	The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	No
13693	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	Yes
844	And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.	No
15770	And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	No
28662	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	No
7626	I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	No
24333	Our exports are dramatically up.	Yes
2293	One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	Yes
39450	Our shared desire is to decrease taxes, but the issue lies with whom we want to lower taxes.	Yes
27629	And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	No
24295	Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	Yes
34838	I have been involved in these issues for a long time, and my experience with them has enabled me to learn how to fix and eliminate the incidents that resulted in people being sent to federal prison.	Yes
17222	The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	Yes
35440	He didn't mention that he opposed a middle class tax cut because it would be funded by raising taxes on the wealthy and an investment tax credit, which would also be paid for by increasing taxes upon the rich.	Yes
2198	And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	No
35317	Medicare has been labeled as a government HMO by the governor.	Yes
37810	That was something we experienced firsthand while she held the position of United States senator.	Yes
3786	So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	Yes
8307	The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	Yes
3213	And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	No
7620	The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	Yes
36872	The government is now spending 42 percent of our economy.	Yes
38868	The programs I previously discussed, such as tax deferrals for overseas, DISC, and tax shelters, are only relevant to individuals earning in the $50 thousand-a-year range or above.	Yes
36051	The purpose of my spending is to communicate a message to the people, not PAC or foreign funds.	Yes
35207	The manufacturing sector has experienced a significant surge in employment in the state, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary noted that the number of private sector jobs created has exceeded that of the rest of America.	Yes
14951	As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	Yes
39374	As I stated before, we were below the national average in inflation when we did that.	Yes
36111	We're aligning the housing for veterans in designated areas.	Yes
9569	If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	Yes
15434	Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	No
37290	Our actions over the past eight years have led to a more secure situation.	Yes
37355	Can you provide information on the drug interactions that have grown and doubled in the past year?	Yes
36677	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which I championed, will enable 25 million individuals to maintain their health insurance coverage when they change jobs or become sick.	Yes
36945	This bill received my endorsement.	Yes
19562	It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	Yes
19124	Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	No
17917	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	No
36802	One million barrels have been imported from Saddam Hussein by us today.	Yes
36063	In comparison to the past, the European Community is now capable of paying significantly more.	Yes
36696	Our progress had reached the point where the Lebanese Government had organized meetings in Geneva to negotiate a peace agreement with the hostile factions.	Yes
17173	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	No
14677	Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	No
35407	With a contribution of $30 thousand from themselves, they were able to save $150,000 in taxes.	Yes
8879	In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	No
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
25603	I remember the night before I became Vice President.	No
7918	If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	No
20869	We had a great time.	No
34784	Our largest agricultural importer of our products, Colombia, has already paid billions in expenses to our businesses for the goods and products we send there, thanks to previous agreements made by President Clinton.	Yes
37178	The prevalent mindset that causes harm to individuals is disregarded when it is revealed that our nation has a 6 percent unemployment rate, 7 percent inflation, and 6 per cent inflation.	Yes
7679	What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	No
29220	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	No
29056	I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	No
12710	We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	No
24339	the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	No
38200	Over $9 billion has been saved in federal spending as a consequence.	Yes
19418	I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	No
18641	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	No
17486	Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	No
38762	In comparison to Georgia, California experienced a decrease in government size, with only one-sixth of the population growing.	Yes
38047	We have a certain number of extra troops on the southern border, but we also need 1,000 more on our northern border.	Yes
18569	You have to close the borders.	No
7841	We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
27122	But look, this has been going on for a year.	Yes
13021	We're on the side of freedom.	No
26500	Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	Yes
24857	We need to do better in job retraining.	No
7780	And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	Yes
11407	He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	No
869	I've picked a lot of people.	No
20480	And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	No
33223	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	Yes
11976	And I think that's the way it ought to be.	No
15374	That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	No
26536	17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
37621	We have been the safety net for illegal immigrants in Mexico, where their population is on the rise and there is no economic infrastructure to take them in and create jobs.	Yes
35352	The president endorses the elimination of $716 billion from that program.	Yes
13764	I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	Yes
22210	Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	No
17644	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	Yes
11402	Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	No
35974	As per my proposal, a crime bill was passed that would have stationed 100,000 police officers on the streets, banned assault weapons, and addressed issues related to capital punishment, including drug trafficking.	Yes
36512	The crime rate in Houston has decreased by 15 percent in the last year due to the mayor's efforts to increase the police force.	Yes
38410	Even though we have maintained the absolute gap over the Soviet Union, as noted in our first debate, the growth of this Administration has been twice that of the Truman Administration.	Yes
1211	I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.	Yes
24687	And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	No
31874	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	No
12582	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	Yes
179	One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	No
12828	Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	No
28758	Tell you what I hear.	No
35972	The decline in home values among retired individuals is causing people to become incapable of paying their mortgage payments.	Yes
27124	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	No
35263	During the first half of 1980, there was a decrease of less than 2 percent in productivity.	Yes
24273	We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	No
7006	We heard the same thing.	No
2623	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	No
24152	And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	No
17348	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	No
3158	We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	Yes
15024	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	Yes
7768	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	Yes
23640	In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	Yes
38247	I have upheld it ever since.	Yes
10564	And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	No
29116	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	No
16024	I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	Yes
4273	And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	No
23145	The federal government is going to run it.	No
38466	There are 30 countries in Iraq and around 40 in Afghanistan.	Yes
20504	I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	No
23188	We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	Yes
20646	And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	No
11447	But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	No
39467	During my tenure as President, I have appointed more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in history.	Yes
24136	I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	No
26538	We need to deal with managed care.	No
37400	The Attorney General has only filed six cases under the voting bill that was passed in 1957 and 1960.	Yes
36831	Our international competitors have shown that they collect taxes up to $3.50 per gallon, which they use to create jobs and improve infrastructure.	Yes
27598	And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	No
37379	Even so, he denounces my vetoes, which have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and potentially another $13 billion.	Yes
35115	In order to be aggressive in enforcing law and order both domestically as well as internationally, I plan on increasing the number of drug enforcement officers by two times, organizing a continental summit for our democratic neighbors and allies to work together soon after January 20th.	Yes
8191	Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	No
15873	I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	No
36663	The gold standard was how she referred to it.	Yes
24643	But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	No
10828	Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	No
14963	In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	Yes
8219	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	No
38922	HUD is enforcing the new legislation that has been outlawed and takes care of redlining.	Yes
15168	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
35382	July twelfth of this year, we granted full permission for the publication of that report.	Yes
31984	His was what he's done to women.	No
20499	Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	No
21664	Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	No
8760	But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	Yes
38260	It is evident that this Administration has accomplished more than the previous Administration.	Yes
25294	We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.	No
13940	No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	No
37511	This is the highest inflation we've seen in twenty-five years, except for this one under this administration, which was fifty years ago.	Yes
25119	Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	No
15260	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	Yes
37850	It's worth noting, particularly in the country of democratic Russia.	Yes
17234	We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	No
38501	Regarding North Korea, the real story is that inspectors and television cameras were present in their nuclear reactor.	Yes
12920	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	No
27517	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	No
26430	For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	Yes
3829	And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	No
39388	The president's visit to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser and another political event in Colorado on the same day as the assassination of the United States ambassador, which was the first time since 1979, is more concerning.	Yes
14675	So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	No
5989	And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	No
2747	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	No
21196	This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	Yes
39440	Demanded for additional nations to acquire them, including Japan, Korea, and Saudi Arabia.	Yes
30064	We will take out ISIS.	No
17964	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	No
38507	Despite my efforts to support and advocate for the all-volunteer Army's establishment in 1973, we have been unable to keep up with the cost of living.	Yes
35801	The testimony of Senator George Aiken, a Republican member of the Senate Agricultural Committee and ranking minority member in 1959, was given to Mr. Nixon regarding the number of Americans who were unable to afford nourishing meals due to their financial status.	Yes
13005	It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	No
35010	Every year, the amount of money that was taxed - there were occasionally exceptions -- increased.	Yes
24311	and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	No
15408	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	No
35869	Those with middle-class income will be granted a tax exemption.	Yes
36899	With a majority of the Senator's own party and most Republicans in favor of it, the amendment established the Senate of America as the only political entity capable of defending the offshore islands.	Yes
25421	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	No
38274	I endorsed fundamental values like guaranteeing that taxpayers can retrieve their money by investing.	Yes
17772	Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	No
34775	The highest paying taxpayers, comprising 5 percent of the total income tax collected by the nation, will continue to pay 60 percent.	Yes
9051	And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	No
11581	I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	No
35589	My plan was to take it out into the country and have every law enforcement official visit those lawmakers.	Yes
4354	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	No
5538	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	No
7756	They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	Yes
27509	And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	Yes
34497	Are you aware that the Com- sends ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as it does from Russia?	Yes
34078	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	No
35830	Medicare will cover all expenses, imposes a $25 premium, and offers benefits that are unattainable in the private sector, particularly for those living in families with low income or with high costs.	Yes
35612	I plan to allocate 1.6 trillion dollars towards defense until 2002, with a budget gap of less than 1 percent between my and the Republican budget.	Yes
35894	He has the liberty to justify any explanation, but the reality is that we're reducing the uninsured portion of our populace.	Yes
8295	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	No
27693	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	No
7087	In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	Yes
39088	The 44 cruise missiles we fired, which cost around $2 million per piece, were intercepted by radar that was fixed in a matter of three days.	Yes
2069	The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	No
27783	And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	No
36013	We are now in a position where we can transition out, as there is no reason for Americans to die while Afghans are capable of defending their own country.	Yes
26389	We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	No
35094	By purchasing a computer for their child who is going to college, they can spend more money, while businesses gain more customers, make more profits, and hire more employees.	Yes
14087	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	Yes
23584	No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	No
105	Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	No
34761	The tax on the wealthy, which is a tax for small business owners in America and raises $600 million by our calculations, contradicts his proposed spending of $2.2 trillion.	Yes
32804	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	Yes
13595	But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	No
894	I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	No
7758	So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	No
36073	We are expecting to spend about $43 billion over the next 10 years on rebuilding our transportation systems through the windfall profits tax.	Yes
37909	Mr. Rockefeller declined the proposal in New York that would have cost six hundred millions of dollars, arguing that it should be allocated to Social Security and rejecting the funding offered by you and Mr Javits.	Yes
34691	Due to the president's troop deployment, there are now 10 times more troops in Iraq than in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is located.	Yes
12698	By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	Yes
35023	Congressional committees have recommended that approximately $10 billion is required to handle the issue.	Yes
36682	At the outset, it should be noted that this board is not in charge of deciding the treatments to be administered.	Yes
33022	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	Yes
35892	The issue at hand, as I believe it is crucial to discuss more than just tobacco, but also drugs, is that drug use among 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in the past 44 months during this administration.	Yes
38064	Instead of a $200 billion deficit, the amount was insufficient.	Yes
39015	A significant flaw has been exposed to us regarding the Sonnenfeldt document, which Mr. Ford supposedly supported, alleging that there is a natural connection between Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	Yes
34833	I requested the president to endorse this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	Yes
15538	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	No
9359	You'll get your chance in a moment.	No
8130	I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	No
29944	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	No
18989	Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	No
22449	I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	No
35387	The same thing is what Mr. Perot desires to do.	Yes
34766	Our focus is on turning our attention to terrorism in partnership with NATO, the world's longest-serving military alliance.	Yes
1171	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	No
29440	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	Yes
3961	Now, you don't do that.	No
20448	Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	No
35875	Approximately 44 percent of our oil is now imported.	Yes
32423	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	No
38407	fighting to reduce the earmarks and get rid of them.	Yes
37345	4 million people will lose their Medicare Advantage entitlement.	Yes
1247	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	No
36893	We have augmented the wilderness lands and game refuges by millions of acres.	Yes
19182	Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	Yes
29176	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	Yes
14089	And we're in real trouble on that.	No
37611	Our actions are being pursued in collaboration with our regional partners, such as Israel, who has a strong interest in the situation in Syria. Additionally, we are coordinating with Turkey and other countries in this region that share similar interests.	Yes
13729	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	No
36494	He is completely committed to me.	Yes
6122	So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	No
19948	Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	Yes
36502	It's unclear if it was a criminal or paternal matter, but the truth is that it cost $3 million in taxpayers' money.	Yes
37000	The level of protection offered is much higher today than it was during my tenure as governor of Texas.	Yes
26722	Let me very briefly give you some examples.	No
34847	For every dollar I allocate to education, he contributes $5 towards a tax cut for the richest 1%.	Yes
20587	That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	No
34746	There are, in fact, thousands of them.	Yes
35575	A judge who was highly anti-police faced the same scrutiny.	Yes
6967	But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	No
36684	The Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement budget was reduced by a third.	Yes
5848	You know, here's what I would say.	No
37262	After Japan, it is the second largest surplus.	Yes
5588	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	Yes
29556	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	Yes
23612	Religion has been a huge part of my life.	No
18326	"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	Yes
16591	We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	No
32275	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	No
21794	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	No
13639	We've got to pay it back.	No
38531	It is important to remember that the cost of doing nothing and defending the current system is significantly higher than trying to save it for our children.	Yes
26084	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	No
20627	It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	No
1343	The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	Yes
14812	Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	No
10611	I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	No
5557	In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	Yes
32234	We're going to be able to.	No
35993	While I backed the endeavor to offer better guidance to the courts, John McCain opposed it.	Yes
35746	Basic checkups that can help them maintain their health will now require copay payments.	Yes
8163	I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	No
36411	In a recent incident, Congressman John Lewis, an American hero I hold dear and admire, accused Sarah Palin and me of being involved in the worst chapter of American history, which was segregation and church bombings.	Yes
38483	A $5.6 trillion surplus has been turned into deficits by this president.	Yes
38280	Those who earn $200,000 annually were given $60,000 in tax relief for 3 years under the 1981 tax bill, while those earning $30,000 per year did not receive any relief or had their taxes rise.	Yes
16088	But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	Yes
33749	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	Yes
3585	That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	No
18846	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	No
35748	"He expressed dissatisfaction with the inadequate equipment of his troops and voted against the $87 billion supplemental I submitted to the Congress, but later released a remarkable statement: ""I actually supported the proposed amount before my vote."""	Yes
29772	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	No
527	Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	No
36870	Senator Dole's criticism of special interest money was not my own, as we did not attempt to save children who were exposed to tobacco and then go to the growers to defend the tobacco industry against the government.	Yes
22486	This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	Yes
12795	I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	No
8490	I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	No
22675	And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	Yes
18735	He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	No
25573	I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	No
10636	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	Yes
33939	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	No
39433	The development of oil and natural gas has led to a significant decrease in our oil imports, which is the lowest level in 20 years.	Yes
39426	Despite the reduced amount, we managed to fix it and ensure that 37 to 40 million people receive their checks on time.	Yes
36171	The fact that Donald did not contribute any money to the government, except for taxes, military, and health care, is incorrect.	Yes
16123	The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	No
13014	Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	Yes
22851	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	No
2316	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	Yes
3998	And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	Yes
13130	Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	Yes
29207	It's very important to me.	No
19661	So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	No
12071	And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	No
21025	One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.	Yes
11926	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	No
34555	With regard to the significant progress made with Government spending, blacks in Detroit, Michigan, have a 56% unemployment rate.	Yes
37438	Furthermore, it is unlawful as the law of the land has mandated that we cannot agree to a treaty where we are not equal.	Yes
15637	And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
23370	Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	No
12201	And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	Yes
19541	We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	Yes
26072	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	No
35916	The wall was Hillary Clinton's preferred option.	Yes
7072	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	No
19451	But I've got a better idea.	No
18877	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	No
28883	You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	No
35394	Our country has a 3 percent share of the world's oil reserves and uses 25% of it, but Senator McCain emphasizes the importance of drilling.	Yes
38086	We grant you the freedom to choose, but we provide greater competition for you to purchase the same health care plan that senators and congressmen offer.	Yes
3115	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	No
25208	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	No
38096	I'm referring to his payment of 12.8 percent, which is the same one that wealthy Americans are seeing all over the country.	Yes
38865	The cost of volunteering is around $27,000 for volunteers.	Yes
38475	Republicans and Democrats are in agreement that $2.5 trillion should be spent on this.	Yes
392	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	No
36715	Before the president invaded Iraq, the war on terror was not a significant concern.	Yes
23098	He wanted to give people rights.	No
28802	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	Yes
11484	Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	No
22852	And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	No
30390	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	No
18880	I have no intention of wilting.	No
24127	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	Yes
27310	They're still number one today.	Yes
14255	Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	Yes
19951	Their budget weakened our support for education.	No
36250	HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, which I support, and the Dingle-Norwood bill that the Governor opposes.	Yes
13255	I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	No
34587	It is our estimation that the federal budget would see an increase of at least one hundred billion dollars and possibly two hundred trillion dollars - or perhaps more, per year due to those programs.	Yes
11571	He is an indicted war criminal.	Yes
39127	The Iowa caucus resulted in his loss.	Yes
38261	The amount of construction done during this Administration is higher than that of the previous administration.	Yes
24074	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	Yes
23488	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	Yes
28904	Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	No
38203	Despite Iran's imminent acquisition of a nuclear weapon, we have tangible (inaudible) information.	Yes
35717	Despite the passage of over 1300 days into his presidency, he still had not presented all of his health care initiative to Congress.	Yes
37539	A truck had attacked our Embassies three times, one after the other, with demolitions.	Yes
15246	And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	No
25614	Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	No
35864	Our surprise was due to their superior number of submarines and 20 percent more bombers with the ability to carry nuclear missiles than us, which outnumbered them by 64 to 36.	Yes
6036	That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	No
16665	At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	Yes
17369	The President says it'll disappear automatically.	No
38271	After bargaining with the oil companies, she turned down their offer to build a $40 billion natural gas pipeline that will meet the United States' energy requirements in the lower 48.	Yes
8246	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	No
15634	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	No
17882	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	No
38860	According to the United States, we are bound by a treaty with all of the Organization of American States that bars us from interfering in any other state's internal affairs and also prohibits them from doing so.	Yes
4318	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	No
347	They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	No
36806	In the past 4 years, there has been an increase of almost $3,000 in personal earnings per capita after taxes.	Yes
34670	We have frozen Medicare and Medicaid, making them a mess.	Yes
33527	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	No
2655	I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	No
39385	We extended more scholarships to the Congo this summer than we had done for Africa in the previous year.	Yes
36511	In essence, we went in that one day.	Yes
7739	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	No
39464	Based on his highly optimistic figures regarding his tax cut, which he claims will produce a balanced budget by 1983, the Senate Budget Committee Report does not cover all of Reagan's defense plans.	Yes
38006	The local school districts' willingness to raise property taxes to a very high level, which would have resulted in diminishing returns, is the reason why these schools were built.	Yes
15151	Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	Yes
36545	They have never endorsed immigration in the past.	Yes
9608	We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	Yes
21463	But character is an important part of the equation.	No

33915	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	Yes
38279	A $90 billion investment has been made in green jobs.	Yes
25639	"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	No
38308	Sadly, I was correct: The barracks bombing resulted in the death of almost 300 Marines.	Yes
24354	That was their response to that sort of action.	No
33949	I'm very proud of that.	No
39166	In recent times, minority affairs have led to the lending of black entrepreneurs by the Small Business Administration.	Yes
2432	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	Yes
493	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	No
8570	First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.	No
5634	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	No
21614	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	No
27111	That's exactly what we're doing.	No
12546	It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	No
33309	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	Yes
15863	I thank you for that.	No
13482	Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	No
29474	And when you look at what you are proposing...	No
6372	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	No
15521	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	Yes
38058	The Department of Energy's budget exceeds $10 billion and is in the multi-billion dollar range.	Yes
6602	And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	No
10084	I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	Yes
37485	At the National Governors Association, I opposed that decision.	Yes
10925	It is breaking family budgets.	No
28948	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	Yes
37567	In my view, they will opt for it as it brings in a net benefit of $5 billion for them.	Yes
37491	At the moment, their growth is at 8 percent.	Yes
25820	It's about where we are now.	No
39060	Approximately 16 percent is achieved when they sell automatically.	Yes
9522	Getting us to a balanced budget.	No
11415	I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	No
22140	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	Yes
25515	Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	No
7284	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	Yes
36882	The lack of knowledge about submarine missile recallability, the fact that 70% of our strategic forces are conventional, and the failure of arms control efforts due to the presence of most Soviet missiles on land three years into his administration make it a challenge for any President to command these actions.	Yes
36211	I have a prescription drug plan for all the elderly.	Yes
37329	The group departed and terminated 1,400 individuals.	Yes
32743	How -- why would these people stay there?	No
35311	One-third of the chances in college are given to white students, making him a top candidate.	Yes
16658	But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	Yes
14231	We can't get anything done.	No
34364	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	No
16639	And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	Yes
24969	I'm sure that you appreciate that.	No
35833	That is not reflected in the record.	Yes
38012	The statement he made is entirely false, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
18338	Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	Yes
8167	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	No
7862	Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	No
36861	Mr. Nixon, who was the top person on Indochina, addressed newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about introducing American boys to the region.	Yes
35419	Our team has the highest job growth rate in the country, as well as having the lowest spending at both state and local levels, and the second lowest tax burden.	Yes
36654	The fact that we have the highest productivity in our workforce and the largest trade deficit in the industrialized world, while ranking behind 9 other nations in terms of pay for our most productive people, is causing a paradox where we are losing outsourced industries.	Yes
16635	I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	Yes
1349	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	No
20700	Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.	No
36223	With a low utilization of our productive capacity and unemployment rates of 7.9 percent, we are facing significant pressure before inflation.	Yes
13717	I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	No
1970	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	No
1333	And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	No
5530	We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	No
34276	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	No
33911	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	No
20378	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	Yes
38784	The stock market is the only thing that looks favorable, but if interest rates are raised even marginally, the situation will come to a head.	Yes
34928	Two distinguished men provided me with a- to-go details from those nations.	Yes
573	I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	No
38423	We have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age as a result of our failure to address the freeze advocates and strengthen our defense.	Yes
11860	And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	No
10025	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	No
19367	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	Yes
34684	It's worth noting that Donald is hinting at his lack of support for the Iraq war.	Yes
15798	Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	No
35465	Our plan incorporated projections from the Senate Budget Committee for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%, but it is feasible to eliminate this rate under our proposal.	Yes
7330	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	No
18728	And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	Yes
15339	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	Yes
9520	Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	No
26456	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	No
2232	And private insurers have to make a profit.	No
34564	He also pursued a disabled journalist, ridiculed and impersonated him on national television.	Yes
35414	The John's lack of experience in executive positions is not entirely apparent.	Yes
37882	The number of people who will switch from private insurance to government insurance is estimated to be 8 million.	Yes
27822	And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	Yes
24826	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	No
37606	Our safety is compromised now that they have the bombs.	Yes
34444	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	No
9713	I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	No
34367	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	No
37126	Prior to the Kansas City convention, he reinstated the defense budget by an additional one point eight billion dollars.	Yes
29289	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	No
24221	Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	No
23150	They create government-sponsored health care.	Yes
36178	We distributed $5.7 billion to the California residents through tax rebates, tax credits, and tax cuts.	Yes
13986	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	No
22025	You have a raging debate about those plans.	No
13117	It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	No
421	No, I don't think there is.	No
16545	Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	Yes
21728	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	Yes
35201	Half of the world's cocaine supply is under our consumption.	Yes
39486	They remain at the top of the list today.	Yes
24843	Take a look at the Middle East.	No
12200	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	Yes
13974	Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	No
19702	We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
8803	we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	Yes
19160	Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	No
32088	She got it from the United States Congress.	Yes
38925	By implementing healthier lunches in schools, we have created environments that promote the health of children...	Yes
38587	Our written instructions were given to Ambassador Glaspie.	Yes
25951	Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	No
29704	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	No
37090	In order to make healthcare more affordable, business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business, Chamber of Commerce, and restaurants have the option to create association plans that cover different jurisdictions, enabling small businesses to participate in national pooling to lower insurance costs.	Yes
12529	Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	No
3173	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	Yes
11510	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	No
38183	More than 150,000 people in the United States have died from AIDS.	Yes
14033	And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	No
35436	The number of schools built has increased significantly over the past seven and a half years, as well as in the last twenty years.	Yes
25510	It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	No
15451	Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	No
7860	In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	No
24603	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	Yes
18445	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	No
22571	Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
333	I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	No
39232	Despite having a surplus of $79 billion, we are now spending $10 billion every month in Iraq.	Yes
14771	To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	No
19868	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	Yes
5813	And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	No
23456	Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	Yes
37974	Over the next decade, Germany will allocate a trillion dollars to construct infrastructure.	Yes
37746	The countries that previously argued that the US' problem was due to low demand are now cooperating with the DEA and military.	Yes
37935	I suggested an amnesty initiative in Chicago in September 1974 that would permit all draft evaders and military deserters to retrieve their good records.	Yes
25380	We'll even give it to you.	No
10124	So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	No
35079	A significant portion of the tax reductions was distributed to low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
19274	This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	No
32030	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	No
15603	He has raised taxes several times.	Yes
6309	Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.	No
21847	He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	Yes
14591	We are a rising nation.	Yes
12939	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
35328	In the past, it was possible for an average family to possess their own residence.	Yes
10175	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	No
27960	but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	No
11815	Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	No
38960	Donald's campaign began with his criticism of immigrants, accusing Mexican immigrants of being rapists, criminals and drug dealers, suggesting a divergent perspective on dealing with immigrants.	Yes
38179	I made every effort to get General Motors to address its issues during its still-favorable period in the mid-'80s.	Yes
37396	In our program for energy independence, we have raised solar energy research from approximately $84 million per year to about $170 million annually.	Yes
35989	Due to the lack of work done by our people, the budget was $65 billion last year, which is the most misaligned in our country's history.	Yes
28048	It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	Yes
12355	Oh, you mean the rules.	No
16349	Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	No
34809	He requested a sum of $932 million for earmark pork barrells, which is almost one million dollars per day for his time in the US Senate.	Yes
37498	Compared to other nations, public education receives a lower share of our income.	Yes
22896	One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.	No
14629	And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	No
35001	A visit to the oldest Jeep plant in America, located in Toledo, Ohio, has brought back 700 jobs due to its plans to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year.	Yes
37928	I believe they are aware that a commission was appointed last year to recommend excellence in education.	Yes
29512	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	Yes
39078	"They approached him 5 days before their assassination and requested his intervention, saying, ""Please, remove them from the place where they were killed."""	Yes
3286	This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	No
25757	I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	No
36514	Oliver, that's great. The bailout seems like a rescue operation in light of the greed and excessive behavior in Washington and Wall Street, which is why Main Street was paying incredibly high fees.	Yes
10221	It used to be the United States of America.	No
10181	But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	No
29871	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	No
5663	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	Yes
20848	Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	No
12766	America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	No
27236	We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	No
8619	If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	No
35141	My plan was announced by a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats, with fewer Republicans than Democrats. The committee's estimates suggest that the average family will save $1200 per year more than the Bush plan did by 2000, $2.2 trillion over the next 12 years, and $400 billion annually by the end of this decade.	Yes
35825	The FBI's inability to communicate with each other has made it necessary for the Patriot Act to be enforced.	Yes
31844	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	No
23306	As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	Yes
25156	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	Yes
9081	We've got to stop drifting.	No
17322	And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	Yes
3270	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	Yes
20026	I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	No
9058	But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	No
38617	A commission of over 2,000 business people, known as the Grace commission, is currently studying 2,478 specific recommendations for improving government efficiency and economics, with 17 percent of them being implemented.	Yes
37410	Meg Whitman was the CEO of a company that started with only 12 employees, and now has 1.3 million members in America who make their living through eBay.	Yes
26431	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	Yes
20474	We don't have to do that.	No
39437	Ours is the most indebted nation on the planet to date.	Yes
33616	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	Yes
25231	"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control."	Yes
39473	The environmental agency of Mr. Ford has estimated that the unemployment rate could climb to 10 percent by 1978 if he becomes president.	Yes
8221	And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	No
29344	So is it President Obama's fault?	No
22914	These are families that get hurt.	No
37910	An examination has been initiated by me.	Yes
9447	'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.	No
21609	And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	No
8621	I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	No
12953	Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	Yes
25146	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	No
18884	He needed to be disarmed.	No
3869	I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	No
39361	With California being the most populous state in the United States and accounting for 10% of its population, I can confidently say that my decision would align with their economic goals, which would make it the seventh-largest economy globally.	Yes
27137	That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	No
35314	It's worth noting that the number of murders and other crimes decreased while mayors were in power.	Yes
37137	The reason for the significant tax hike you got was due to.	Yes
28081	The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.	Yes
7725	And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	No
28469	In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
26033	Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	Yes
24280	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	No
14646	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	Yes
36809	A re-election of the president would result in a national debt of nearly $20 trillion.	Yes
12760	Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	No
20017	I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	No
39021	The lady in this area was informed by me that we have spent an estimated $10 billion on homeland security to $30 billion.	Yes
25815	"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	No
32009	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	Yes
36613	Over the past 121 years, there has been a larger amount of oil extracted from wells than those that have been dug.	Yes
23352	That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	Yes
2109	What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	No
15389	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	Yes
22653	I would have brought our allies to our side.	No
22345	I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	No
15177	And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	Yes
35548	To give an example, we have gained roughly four million new jobs in the past 17 months.	Yes
26230	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	No
34542	Delaware's laws on credit cards are very relaxed, which is why everyone goes there.	Yes
968	Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.	No
8392	I think we're going to have to do it.	No
16590	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	Yes
24702	All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	No
35432	Despite the fact that inflation had already reached over 18% in January, his economic message for the year stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment to control inflation.	Yes
29703	We have to work with the police.	No
19237	And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	No
17010	We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	No
8740	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	No
29831	And it was terminated by current mayor.	Yes
23785	We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	No
39383	Only 20 percent of our current Middle Eastern weapons shipment, which includes Iran, is sent to Israel.	Yes
14276	And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	No
15703	They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	No
36085	Mr. Nixon's deficits were four times larger than the current one he had.	Yes
34932	CAFTA, the largest multinational, was not included in my voting.	Yes
34661	To cover the cost of college, I offer a $4,000 tuition tax credit that parents and children can use to pay for their education.	Yes
1243	This has not been done, unfortunately.	No
9739	He didn't call for self-deportation.	No
1428	As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	Yes
35247	I have included it in every proposal I've submitted to the Congress.	Yes
37849	The risk of losing their employer-provided health care is a significant concern under Senator McCain's plan.	Yes
15767	The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	No
34927	There has been a lack of rapid economic growth.	Yes
29867	Well, I -- I do think...	No
37284	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has stated that your proposal will result in the elimination of 700,000 jobs.	Yes
10052	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	No
38055	I was also troubled by Mr. Ford's comment about unemployment, which suggested that the country could only achieve its goals during the Johnson and Kennedy administrations when they were at war.	Yes
17522	That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	No
19149	I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	No
15355	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	No
6741	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	No
36168	In 1987, when President Reagan was still in office, he made a $100,000 advertisement in the New York Times and expressed that we were the world's laughingstock, just like NBC had previously stated.	Yes
3622	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	Yes
38883	Our intellectual property, patents, designs, and technology are being stolen, with hackers infiltrating our computers, deceptively creating fake goods, etc.	Yes
6774	What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.	No
20069	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	No
12768	I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	No
22280	Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	No
34877	The tomato grower is the one who pays less for their produce than what shows up on a can.	Yes
38435	The number of crimes has decreased for eight consecutive years.	Yes
36915	The reason I cared about his record was that he spoke of deficits on numerous occasions, saying they were not to be disgraced and could help reduce unemployment.	Yes
23995	And so I just have a different approach.	No
34695	It was given by the president in a tax cut to the most privileged citizens.	Yes
39018	Our spending has surpassed $600 billion, and it is on the verge of reaching $1 trillion.	Yes
21588	I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	No
5579	... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	No
38110	The total amount we have spent is $4 trillion.	Yes
16396	That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	No
38426	The lesson to be learned in Central America, particularly the recent scandal in Nicaragua where we have been providing support to hired assassins and criminals, has served to strengthen our adversaries.	Yes
32598	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	Yes
15512	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	No
35286	They are being crushed, and a significant number of them are going bankrupt due to health care.	Yes
26387	So we talk about all these new jobs.	No
22082	I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	No
17201	First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	No
16342	But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	No
27086	Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	No
2476	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	No
22913	And a lot of our military are underpaid.	Yes
25903	I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	No
24792	We just have a bad system.	No
6239	And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	No
22260	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	No
7931	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	No
1367	I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	No
8523	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	No
16139	Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	No
24530	But I can tell you this.	No
14312	-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	No
13428	This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	Yes
35035	You've outlined some items, such as deferring foreign income, that you believe would result in a savings of approximately $500 million.	Yes
37691	The Senate passed a bill once again this year, but it was unsuccessful in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
19882	You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	No
2217	They'll have at least two plans.	Yes
34982	I declared my commitment to ensuring the safety of women who take the drug.	Yes
1365	Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	Yes
33841	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	Yes
37113	In my opinion, the Burger Court has validated the Warren Court's fundamental and contentious ruling.	Yes
35212	Five percent of the world's population resides in this country, you know.	Yes
18751	And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	No
2820	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
36281	Bin Laden remained unfound by us.	Yes
19779	That's why we're moving in the right direction.	No
34834	The most expensive component in the car manufacturing process is the labor cost, which comes with a wage of $1 per hour and no health care coverage.	Yes
956	Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?Ã¢â€°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.	No
37424	Today, only 95% of them are uninspected.	Yes
13772	I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	Yes
37749	All of them have been granted a tax break.	Yes
18008	And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	No
14073	And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	No
25295	And one of those dreams is justice.	No
36596	The first step I will take is to ensure that the borders are exposed to more leaks today than they were before 9/11.	Yes
30184	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	No
37486	The annual expenditure on homeland security has been tripled by my administration, now at $30 billion.	Yes
24509	And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	No
3432	So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.	No
37593	The Baghdad Pact was a crucial pillar of our support in the Middle East, but it fell apart when the Iraqi Government was changed.	Yes
2947	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	No
14700	First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	No
12821	I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	No
3465	But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	No
3182	Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	No
21767	Send us some people that will pass the idea.	No
38771	It's been disputed, but it doesn't deter him from speaking his mind up.	Yes
34672	I must first confess to having signed onto a tort reform bill that tackled civilian aviation some two years ago.	Yes
20509	First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	No
18336	What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	No
13134	The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	Yes
34427	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	No
1584	Employment ought to be restored to our people.	No
27202	But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	No
38329	The President's opposition to term limits and a constitutional amendment intended to balance the budget are both opposed by him.	Yes
8965	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	Yes
29687	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	No
35099	Pam, the president didn't disclose that his tax cuts will be implemented starting in 2000, but these increases will continue without pause.	Yes
7511	And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	No
92	Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	Yes
6666	And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	No
18193	I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	No
36660	The Administration was the first significant nation to resist abuse in Tiananmen Square.	Yes
3657	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	No
2095	Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	Yes
2756	You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	No
28698	But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	No
36363	The fact that the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropriations request by over ten billion dollars in the past eight years is entirely wrong and incorrect.	Yes
12803	I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	No
26771	We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	No
6520	Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	No
34042	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	Yes
38154	In just 2 years, crime has decreased for the first time in many decades or with the help of records, and last year saw the most significant drop in crime.	Yes
5983	And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	No
20062	I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	No
5687	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	Yes
10767	The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	Yes
3227	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	No
39177	The tumultuous events of the past few years in the Middle East have resulted in an increase in chaos, with Al Qaida and other jihadist organizations showing up.	Yes
3758	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	No
39357	This administration was nation building, so the tanks were not given to them.	Yes
37250	The birth certificate was not obtained by her.	Yes
36840	The dock was the destination of Coast Guard cutters who were not patrolling during the summer.	Yes
37336	The world is cognizant of the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
17504	I don't know the answer to when life begins.	No
38202	With Iran on the brink of acquiring a nuclear weapon, we have tangible (inaudible) facts to share.	Yes
1008	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.	No
30212	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	Yes
36643	The business community, labor, and health care communities, along with almost all residents, played a significant role in supporting my state's push for universal health insurance, making it the only state in the country to do so.	Yes
35913	The aid has been directed towards the most vulnerable, with a 130 percent limit in place.	Yes
15047	But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	No
27271	But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	Yes
27097	We are playing the leadership role.	No
8045	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	No
29743	They would have won an appeal.	No
37835	The number of unemployed Americans is 9 million, which is less than 5.4 percent.	Yes
1126	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	No
22424	I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	No
34906	I, as the Governor of California, were in charge of enforcing the most stringent air pollution regulations in the United States, which is the strictest air quality law that has been implemented to date.	Yes
35076	Whenever the Congress has proposed amendments, the Republican administration has delayed implementation dates for automobile manufacturers who cannot meet them.	Yes
37642	We were plunged into war by three Democratic presidents.	Yes
11398	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	No
1421	Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	Yes
26403	We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	No
3236	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	No
27258	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	No
36827	The rich are bearing a heavier weight on the overall tax burden.	Yes
38374	The plan of Senator Obama is built on the principle of class warfare, let's distribute the wealth.	Yes
21458	It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	No
1523	They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	No
8912	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	No
39082	The Carter-Mondale administration's double-digit inflation, 211/2-percent interest rates, and the grain embargo had a devastating effect on the farmers, who were negatively impacted by our unreliable supplier status nationwide.	Yes
11543	I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	No
12965	Why didn't we bring students over here?	No
34141	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	No
6277	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	No
26410	That's what we will do.	No
36045	Even though there was a small business exemption, Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he believed that other nations could not do so.	Yes
27872	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	No
10335	In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	No
6563	We're not giving this away for nothing.	No
19037	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	No
6349	And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	No
28747	Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	No
35739	Incomes rose for all.	Yes
24384	They didn't go over to coddle.	No
35040	The health sector currently comprises three hundred and twenty-two programs, which are overseen by eleven major departments and agencies, along with sixty advisory commissions.	Yes
12991	More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	Yes
36583	I was able to pass legislation that required more careful dosing, which has resulted in healthcare being provided to hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve personnel. Furthermore, children can receive safer medicines due to my work.	Yes
32723	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	No
27955	I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	No
27354	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	Yes
19707	Did we inflict any damage?	No
19039	If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	No
16974	Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	No
38101	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, your initial Social Security tax amount would have been raised.	Yes
38823	We hold roughly 30 percent of the world's economic trade power.	Yes
35053	From my experience, abortions have been used as a form of birth control.	Yes
26963	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	Yes
38694	The income for the year in question, which I analyzed today, is $694 million.	Yes
19139	For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	Yes
35565	Presently, forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance.	Yes
27698	Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	No
15591	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	No
34474	I must have had a different experience than the vice president because this administration has cut programs for children, nutrition, and other areas that can help young people lead healthier lives.	Yes
6625	No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.	No
32308	So he would have been alive today.	No
14587	He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	No
25414	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	No
37279	Over a decade ago, I made the decision to postpone the production of the F - 14, and I will explain why.	Yes
39276	We had a deficit of $800 billion.	Yes
7763	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	Yes
12722	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	Yes
20677	The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	No
3100	But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	No
24465	I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	No
4402	I'm ready to go at it right now.	No
8555	Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	Yes
37226	Ohio has a high rate of lack of health insurance among its citizens, with 114,000 people not having it under President Bush and 82,000 individuals who did not have coverage under him.	Yes
24902	To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	No
35873	The President has been right on all fronts in my opinion regarding Bosnia.	Yes
35238	I have endorsed the State of Texas' strong charter school movement by signing the bill.	Yes
7875	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	Yes
14981	And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	No
19434	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	Yes
34537	The top positions in English and math are held by our eighth-grade students.	Yes
36003	Our focus is on a single conflict.	Yes
10916	Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	Yes
20960	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	No
1751	Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	No
14519	That, however, is not my only passion.	No
25965	We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	Yes
11990	In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	Yes
20007	Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	Yes
180	I want to keep this economic recovery going.	No
17390	I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	No
22367	This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	No
8215	And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	No
2744	I'll get incomes up again.	No
17252	And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	No
35843	I don't hold the administration responsible for the strained relationship with Pakistan.	Yes
29690	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	No
26846	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	No
37265	It is impossible to see it rising if we continue the policies we did with Cuba in recent years and neglect them across all of Latin America, even though we haven't given any attention to their needs during the last eight years.	Yes
35732	Similarly, McKinsey and Company's study revealed that 30 percent of American businesses are expecting to remove individuals from insurance coverage.	Yes
3146	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	Yes
36670	You cast your vote for tax hikes on 98 occasions.	Yes
39076	I assert that the programs implemented during the Truman Administration, such as the Federal Reserve and interest-free/loose money programs, are more closely linked to the economic program.	Yes
2439	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	No
28488	Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	No
36291	Personal income has decreased as a result of increased work demands.	Yes
13636	And we are bleeding arterially.	No
28270	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	No
37015	The death penalty for drug traffickers was one of the 60 death penalties included in our support for a crime bill.	Yes
36209	Don't overlook that, it was in 1993.	Yes
25917	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	No
38078	Our nation has been engulfed by lobbyists from other countries.	Yes
34611	Our experience with Central Accounting.	Yes
35800	Mr. Nixon referred to Senator George Aiken, the Republican member of the Senate Agricultural Committee and ranking minority member in 1959, who claimed that 26 million Americans were not financially capable of affording a decent diet.	Yes
18652	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	Yes
38080	A portion of the funds is diverted to terrorist groups.	Yes
907	Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.	No
35003	We have the strictest laws, but also a lot of gun violence.	Yes
7917	That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	No
36132	Senator Obama is a newcomer, having requested $932 million in spending projects.	Yes
12711	His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	No
25240	It is a question of leadership.	No
38988	The sanctions have been upheld by us.	Yes
37575	During my tenure as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, I was well-versed in the United States' approach to negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	Yes
20877	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	No
17176	I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	No
34543	Delaware has a relaxed legal system that permits credit card transactions, which is why everyone goes there.	Yes
26176	This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	Yes
8734	That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	No
7851	One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	No
36787	Do you acknowledge that the growth rate in the past decade has exceeded the average growth amount?	Yes
9088	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	No
1389	But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	Yes
37376	Having vetoed four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon, it's clear to me that this isn't the case.	Yes
22018	But that's what the election's about.	No
7030	That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	Yes
29144	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	No
38031	Individuals must take note: Six months before I arrived, the stock market began to plummet.	Yes
744	And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.	Yes
26030	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	No
39243	Due to the occurrence of leverage buyouts and terrible events, the airline industry has already suffered destruction.	Yes
25210	I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	No
37590	The primary point that my opponent wants you to disregard is his decision to authorize the use of force and his subsequent assertion that it was the wrong war at the incorrect time and place.	Yes
37667	Your goal cannot be achieved with a debt of $20 trillion.	Yes
24808	I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	No
34330	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	No
368	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.	No
22457	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	No
14910	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	Yes
17879	"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	No
11408	One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	No
36405	850,000 tons of ammo were not stored in our storage.	Yes
32347	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	Yes
11329	I came from very modest means.	No
38791	If I were president at the time, Captain Khan's heroic actions would not have resulted in his being alive due to his unknowingness as an American citizen.	Yes
37862	I want to emphasize that the bill referred to by Mr. Nixon did not make any reference to Wilkes-Barre or Scranton, nor did it address West Virginia.	Yes
15096	And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	No
39235	Currently, there is an excessive amount of military-style weapons on the streets, which is supported by both Donald and the gun lobby.	Yes
15759	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	No
29574	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	No
37107	A record-breaking year for the United States has seen an increase in employment, incomes, low crime rates, and welfare benefits, while also maintaining a peaceful and stable image of peace.	Yes
23329	I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	Yes
1149	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	No
7823	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	No
15370	But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	No
12155	There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	No
8043	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	No
21561	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	Yes
25028	I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	No
14566	If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	No
36326	It took him almost eight years to double it, and he achieved it in seven-and-a-half years, partially to be precise.	Yes
6316	It's not going to happen on its own.	No
13899	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	No
37981	Did you realize that he was present in the Senate but never put forward any legislation to do so?	Yes
11766	I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	No
13706	Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	Yes
16718	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	No
19473	And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	No
18197	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	Yes
9191	And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	No
7809	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	No
5943	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	No
38509	We have not evaded the possibility of engaging in arms control discussions with the Soviet Union.	Yes
38752	The missiles were considered less dangerous than ballistic missile defenses because they could be fired and retrieved in case of miscalculation, according to him.	Yes
24492	I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	No
19443	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	No
25642	We have met young America.	No
598	And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	No
12775	I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	No
37148	Energy is under attack from the Obama administration, making this a great question.	Yes
36422	Your vote resulted in the reduction of services for 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
20388	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	No
39266	He suggests refraining from doing it, but the policies he's outlining involve imposing conditions on M.F.N.	Yes
4048	So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	No
2755	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	Yes
36555	When discussing percentage appointments, there are more Members of Congress who have been under investigation than those in the executive branch by a certain percentage.	Yes
35777	Social Security remains unchanged until at least the third decade of the next century, as you pointed out.	Yes
34934	Our construction output has exceeded that of any previous Administration in the last seven years, with a thirty percent increase in house construction.	Yes
37394	The oil reserves in today's wells are significantly higher than the ones we have already extracted and put into use.	Yes
18987	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	No
16860	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	No
34987	They are not complying with the sanctions.	Yes
16895	It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	No
18152	First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	Yes
37853	Our domestic production and drilling activities need to be increased, but we only have a modest oil supply of 3 percent and consume around 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
3700	We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	No
21398	I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	No
37665	The amount of debt you had, which was slightly more than $10 trillion during your time in office, has now reached $16 trillion.	Yes
36486	The Agricultural Department's spending on agriculture has been lower in the past century than the current eight-year period.	Yes
37532	The average serviceman today is estimated to be at least 15%, which is a modest estimate and 15% lower than the cost of living during that time.	Yes
34527	It's ironic that due to the aging of our population, we now have a lower percentage of parents with children among American voters than ever before, while also having the largest generation of students in public schools.	Yes
39092	We have taken on board the thousands and thousands of refugees.	Yes
16343	And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.	No
21407	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	No
20223	I come from West Texas.	No
27754	How strong is our economy?	No
14164	I look on this as history.	No
3185	The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	No
2065	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	No
740	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	No
37623	The Iraqi army, along with the Kurdish forces and special forces' assistance and guidance, have given me hope.	Yes
27579	I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	Yes
20458	I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	No
35835	The current population is 300,000 compared to the previous eight years.	Yes
23519	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	No
9611	And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	Yes
5535	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	No
17379	But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	No
19242	I thought it was a good program.	No
20419	It's an issue I know a lot about.	No
1115	And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.	No
36100	Due to a 14 percent increase in the cost of living over the past two years, women and young people have been forced to work due to their fathers' lack of financial support for essential items such as food, housing, and clothing.	Yes
35658	To ensure that coal is produced with greater efficiency and purity, we have invested the most in clean coal technology.	Yes
19328	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	No
3361	Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?	No
2792	Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	No
21327	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	No
38821	According to Mr. Dulles, it is two to three times greater than ours.	Yes
14154	It wasn't failing to serve.	No
36417	The CIA did not submit 12 of the original copies for printing, but they were still distributed there.	Yes
18031	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	No
5730	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	Yes
35554	The first two years of your presidency were spent without any tax breaks, Mr. President.	Yes
1852	Donald Trump is a small business.	No
3230	This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	Yes
37435	In my opinion, we can provide sufficient tax relief to taxpayers by removing ten million individuals from the previous eight years and increasing the taxes for those in higher tax brackets, as well as other measures.	Yes
12598	It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	No
12445	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	No
38161	The investment in solar and wind, Solyndra, Fisker, Tester, and Ener1 amounts to $90 billion over a 50-year period.	Yes
36900	A significant number of young African-American and Latino men were incarcerated for nonviolent crimes.	Yes
27747	They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	Yes
12376	Well, we all make mistakes.	No
10074	That's not what we do.	No
38696	Congress has spent a billion dollars less than President Bush requested, and the White House staff has increased their expenses significantly over the last four years.	Yes
35606	To the north, they have North Korea with a force of five hundred thousand well-trained soldiers who are supported by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.	Yes
37845	Glaspie's documents have already been submitted to the US Senate.	Yes
35468	In our five-year plan for leasing offshore lands, we proposed to drill more land than was previously available for drilling since the program began in 1954.	Yes
33390	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	Yes
36127	The intelligence budget was reduced by $7.5 billion after 1993, making it an unusual statement for him.	Yes
18961	I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	No
26004	Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	Yes
2530	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	No
35961	The economy was reportedly the best in almost three decades when it took place in February, according to him.	Yes
9562	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	Yes
38439	Our society has experienced a decline of $1600 in average income over the last two years, with 2–3rds of its population working for less money than 10 years ago.	Yes
35652	We are in a mess with an outstanding debt of $20 trillion.	Yes
27512	I think they noticed that as well.	No
38979	The medical liability issues are a significant concern.	Yes
652	Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	No
38082	The United States was the driving force behind a no-fly declaration in the United Nations.	Yes
2051	If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	No
5580	Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	Yes
34293	But I just have to...	No
18260	You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	No
25078	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	No
34634	The president did not honor his pledge to finance No Child Left Behind.	Yes
15097	These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	No
6206	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	Yes
8189	Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?	No

22970	Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	Yes
17454	In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	Yes
6469	Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.	Yes
38421	They were forced to remove the inspectors and television cameras while they remained silent.	Yes
8393	And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	No
38715	In the last nine months of this year, our economic growth has been sluggish.	Yes
3217	And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	No
26335	Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	Yes
16922	And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	No
16540	I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	No
39305	Having been ready for 15 years, the Soviet Union has faced opposition to the B - 1.	Yes
1935	One, of course, is to raise taxes.	No
34054	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	No
7582	As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	No
33747	I have fought against that as a senator.	Yes
35110	They receive $145 in tax relief under Vice President Gore's proposal.	Yes
38228	The gross domestic product is estimated to be around five hundred billion dollars.	Yes
11602	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	No

17860	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	Yes
28783	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	No
12797	But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	No
36515	Thanks for your response, Oliver. This is a great question, as I believe the bailout is often referred to as rescuing because Main Street was already burdened by greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street.	Yes
35327	The Chinese have exerted a considerable amount of power over North Korea, in some ways exceeding our dominance.	Yes
8872	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	Yes
38772	I am interested in reinvesting the $716 billion that you have reduced into Medicare.	Yes

18817	We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	Yes
5888	If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	No

4323	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	No
26728	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	No

12868	I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	No
27538	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
7924	I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	No
8663	But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.	No
8823	or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	Yes
36436	In Missouri, you've accumulated roughly $3,500.	Yes

34638	In a remarkable move, 10 individuals who have had that great responsibility have expressed their disbelief in Donald Trump's ability to control the nuclear codes or pressurize the button.	Yes
11776	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	No
13966	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	Yes
8350	And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	No
38460	Governor Carter has publicly stated in an interview that he would raise taxes on approximately half of the working population, with taxpayers earning around $14 thousand each.	Yes
1385	The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	No
27342	I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	No
38204	The deletion of 33,000 emails has resulted in her claiming that nothing was wrong.	Yes
747	We've got to treat it as international crime.	No
3373	We can be once again.	No
35564	The number of Americans without health insurance in the United States is forty-seven million.	Yes
11512	And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	No
29857	I'd just like to respond.	No
31913	But I have tremendous respect for women.	No
25310	And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	No
4153	We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	Yes
15531	I made a good selection.	No
39458	The President's attempt was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek refused to withdraw.	Yes

19688	So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	No
19305	In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.	Yes
38856	Hillary, they commenced from that limited area and now have representatives in 32 nations.	Yes
35570	In Richmond, teenage cocaine use has decreased by 60% in the past few years, and that's a good indication.	Yes
18209	The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	No
33048	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	No
878	We shouldn't do that.Ã¢â€°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	No
20859	Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	No
28713	And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.	No
36932	Sadly, nearly 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
35403	I have been critical of the Administration's policy and Mr. Nixon'S press conference in Havana in 1955 praised the competence and stability of his dictatorship; that dictator had killed more than twenty thousand Cubans over seven years.	Yes
34800	Our vote on the U.N.'s Red China vote, which was focused on Liberia and South Africa, resulted in our support being given only to two African countries.	Yes
38658	They are provided with healthcare care.	Yes
4110	And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	No
19450	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	No
35129	Through our successful efforts in securing an Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement, we have established a shared defense capability with Israel and Egypt.	Yes
1350	And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	No
34637	This was not only the primary factor contributing to our federal deficit and health care costs, but also affected families who were concerned about the possibility of going broke if they fell ill.	Yes
35386	Mr. Perot intends to do the same thing.	Yes
19810	I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	No
24664	Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	No
35239	The State of Texas has a robust charter school movement, which I signed into law.	Yes
37228	I opposed the idea of funding a mission that had no timetable and was unrestricted, offering monetary compensation to George Bush.	Yes

27632	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	No
11034	And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	Yes
23604	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	No
24670	Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	No
2601	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	No
32862	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	No
11088	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	No
26209	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	Yes
36295	A $2 trillion gap in Social Security could be buried if the CBO approves the president's plan, as today'S employees would contribute to the system for current pensioners.	Yes
21408	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	No
909	But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	Yes
37577	Campaign finance reform has been and is always supported by the American people, including Perot supporters.	Yes

20786	$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	Yes
20996	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	Yes
39206	In recent years, we have made efforts to raise the minimum wage.	Yes
35621	Over the past eight years, I have been fortunate enough to receive the opportunity to reject the old economic plan and introduce a new one that has led to significant progress, 22 million jobs added, and the most successful outcome in history.	Yes
1843	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	No
12567	To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	No

38488	The terrorists' warnings were ignored as they carried out a fourth identical attack in the same area.	Yes
4203	You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	No
19095	Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	Yes
722	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	No
37726	It is Mr. Bush's word and we have no proof that our government had informed Saddam Hussein about the possibility of him owning a section of Kuwait.	Yes
16440	We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	No
36644	If India were to lose her battle, with three quarters of the world's population living within her borders, I believe that our forces could be weakened.	Yes
35108	It's important to note that our military spending has gone up every year since I took office.	Yes
8275	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	Yes
2000	If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	No

37781	Our jobs are being removed from the country.	Yes
4169	We will take a look.	No
35856	It was the same Government that declared in 1920 that we had sufficient oil for 13 years, and then announced 19 years later that there was enough left for another 15 years.	Yes
15069	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	Yes
19971	And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	No
37932	The threat of military strikes in Pakistan by Senator Obama is not something I am willing to entertain.	Yes
19846	I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	No
30410	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	No
32852	This is the only one country he's ever known.	No
12547	That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	No

3149	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	No

20392	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	Yes
11869	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	No
35385	Our nation is still evolving.	Yes
13645	The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	No

393	But that, too, will require some choices.	No
13419	The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	Yes

27102	When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	Yes
24759	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	No
39457	Our intervention led to the most severe reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	Yes
19422	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	No
39417	This man was brought to justice by the Reagan-Bush administration.	Yes
38644	Your health insurance can be maintained by obtaining it through your employer, while also allowing you to choose the doctor and maintain your plan.	Yes
2092	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	Yes
25625	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	No
15713	And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	No
8699	Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	No
35849	These surpluses were produced by the farmer as per the government's legislation during the war.	Yes
17812	In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	Yes
19745	Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	No
28059	It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	No
23217	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	No
15755	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	No
17118	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	No
2075	And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	No
8581	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	No
8578	Not at all Because these are determined men.	No
39038	The crime rate has decreased, there are fewer individuals on welfare rolls than before welfare reform, and child support has increased by 50 percent. The bill also includes 60 death penalties, 100,000 police officers, an assault weapons ban, as well as the introduction of a criminal justice system.	Yes
528	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	Yes
16918	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	Yes
37832	At that time, I suggested to a leading member of the House Budget Committee that recalculating the cost of living benefits for civil service and military retirees could potentially save $5 billion to $7 billion.	Yes

36573	We were previously in possession of 18.	Yes
27914	And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	Yes
38008	AARP believes that the savings we obtain from Medicare can strengthen the system and extend the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	Yes

2173	They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.	No
38807	The expenditure of billions of dollars on railroad cars is not a viable option, as it is essentially destroying our defense position and being an unnecessary, unfeasible, and unaffordable weapons system.	Yes
7134	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	Yes
21645	So you've got to create jobs.	No
29479	... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	No
37408	Our education system requires improvement, and we've made significant strides in utilizing both Democratic and Republican ideas that are already yielding results in some of the most challenging schools.	Yes
38525	Today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads on land, air, and sea, according to Andrea.	Yes
9603	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	No
22331	Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.	No
1586	We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	Yes
18519	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	No

12604	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	Yes
39321	You wouldn't alter it since these individuals provided you with the funds to run negative ads against Donald Trump.	Yes
16252	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	No
35353	Taking out $716 billion from that program is supported by the president.	Yes
36973	This president has caused the loss of health insurance for five million people.	Yes
23177	We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	Yes
12891	This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	No
34676	The welfare rolls have been halved in our country.	Yes
6200	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	No
29923	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	No
846	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	No
26362	I only have 30 seconds.	No
12397	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	No
1995	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	No
24846	And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	Yes
21335	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	No
20810	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	Yes
24667	I will have a unique mandate.	No
19405	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	Yes
35700	Regarding the U-2 flights, I would like to emphasize that my support for the President has been ongoing.	Yes
19821	I'm not some extremist out here.	No
34485	A man in Nicaragua, who is under contract with the CIA, is providing guidance on military tactics for the contras.	Yes
28684	Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	No
7309	And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	Yes
1668	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	Yes
39391	It's a part of my healthcare plan.	Yes
25326	And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	No
1706	That's not the right answer for America.	No
4179	I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	No
6659	"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	No
25512	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	No
36048	In 1975, I was the first president to order affirmative action through various cabinet departments, including the Department of Commerce, to ensure that no American businessman or organization could discriminate against Jews due to an Arab boycott.	Yes
2618	When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	No
37420	He doesn't approve of trickle down government, but he mentions the Reagan-Bush era where 15 million jobs were created.	Yes
8905	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	No
3602	But let's go back to the original point.	No
7172	You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.	No
21041	It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	Yes
35344	A surplus of $2.3 trillion can be utilized to ensure that younger workers have access to Social Security benefits in the future.	Yes
29573	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	No
35083	Despite the bill's relative rarity, it was not possible to convince a Republican to join. At least four out of eight Democrats voted to send it to the House floor, with none being Republicans themselves, and they joined forces with those who opposed it.	Yes
5576	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	Yes
13394	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	Yes
1141	It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	No
35410	I don't think that's too extreme; however, the House of Representatives saw a vote of almost two-thirds to three-quarters against the proposal.	Yes
22998	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	No
20359	I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	No
1030	The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	No
1548	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	No
39104	The governor suggests a budget of $45 billion.	Yes
34697	There are more than 130 candidates I've appointed, so there's a record.	Yes
34957	Despite its sound, the program is not practical for 500 economists, including seven Nobel laureates, business writers like Business Week, and Senator Warren Rudman, who previously served as New Hampshire's Republican senator.	Yes
27	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	No
19277	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	No
33575	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	No
36167	A tax reduction for the majority of small businesses is included in my proposal.	Yes
38185	The military was removed from that in 1977.	Yes
35611	"The president's defense secretary called the proposed military budget cuts a ""trillion-dollar catastrophe,"" which is not what I meant."	Yes
36259	In recent years, the Treasury has imposed a heavier tax burden on farmers due to the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
25833	But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	Yes
36296	The way I did this involved significant downsizing of personnel in specific areas.	Yes
34346	He was criticizing President Reagan.	Yes
38500	The factual narrative about North Korea is that we had inspectors and television cameras stationed in their nuclear reactor.	Yes
11896	The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	No
35371	Our defenses have become so sophisticated that the costs are out of reach.	Yes
36700	The president publicly reversed it while the president of South Korea was present.	Yes
10686	Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	No
18804	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	No
20741	I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	No
17445	I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	No
4245	So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	No
35957	In the past year, he has broken it three times.	Yes
26757	We still have some of that hatred inside us.	No
34571	She is guilty of a very serious crime, which is clearly corrupt.	Yes
39026	The issue is not with Mr. Nixon, who now maintains that he also supports the Eisenhower approach.	Yes
25147	The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	Yes
12728	The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	No
2979	The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	Yes
24243	I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	No
14934	We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	No
26658	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	No
16970	So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	No
38151	In Washington, both parties committed a mistake in the S&L business by deregulating them without proper capital requirements, oversight, regulation, or executive training.	Yes
899	I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	No
13465	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	No
2290	Let me give you an example.	No
6898	The government doesn't require you to do anything.	No
18506	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	No
29105	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	No
7795	And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	No
4072	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	No
16999	We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	No
23222	Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
34759	It was clear to us in 1983 that we had a 75-year fixation.	Yes
35118	The announcement made this week indicates that the annual rate of constructing new houses will be around one million, eight hundred and several thousand, which is a significant increase from last year and notably from the earlier part of this year.	Yes
39194	The size of his proposal is three times greater than that of President Clinton's proposed plan from eight years ago.	Yes
6861	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	Yes
18400	It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	No
38574	I, along with Democrats and Republicans, worked to reduce the discretionary domestic budget by one trillion dollars.	Yes
16809	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	Yes
35338	I have an average of twenty-six points in two years.	Yes
21089	You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.	No
36804	I mentioned earlier that we reached an agreement to limit the number of uh - urh missile launchers to twenty-four times.	Yes
38129	It was the lowest number of new purchases since 1982, as per the latest report.	Yes
19299	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	No
39103	The benefits of completing the free trade agreement with Colombia, which would have resulted in billions of dollars in American dollars being spent on creating jobs and businesses in the United States to facilitate access to those markets, were just mentioned by me.	Yes
27170	But it's an honor that we have it.	No
27175	Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	Yes
11914	We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	No
37271	Our country's ill-fated economy, which involves being taken by every country on the planet, is not sustainable due to our trade deficit of nearly $800 billion annually.	Yes
36247	Almost 90% of the active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, on their way there, or having returned from the war.	Yes
35137	During Governor Bush's administration, Texas has experienced a decline in health care coverage, falling behind other states by the 50th spot.	Yes
14057	If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	No
24282	I have number 1 and 1A.	No
17654	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	No
6148	You all just heard my plan.	No
35067	No one of them opted for a Communist regime.	Yes
15081	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	No
21415	In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	Yes
22389	I can think of many.	No
22822	The president did not do what was necessary.	No
38417	The amount of oil we imported was twice as much as the one year ago, with a difference of 2 million barrels.	Yes
30327	Can they rely on us?	No
37936	Despite the Soviet Union's refusal, we went to the summit and it turned out to be a disaster.	Yes
36471	After a few months, he declared his intention to decrease the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	Yes
32496	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	Yes
15630	(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	No
13275	Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	No
39121	The conclusion of the civil war in the south of Indochina was due to our strong position, which led to the departure of Communists and the establishment of a free and sturdy colony.	Yes
9034	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	No
34685	Once again, Donald is hinting at his stance against the Iraq war.	Yes
12573	First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	No
37083	In the previous debate, she lied because she claimed to have never mentioned the gold standard.	Yes
35477	Approximately fourteen to fifteen thousand individuals made use of that program.	Yes
20665	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	No
13958	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	No
35445	The cost of health insurance has gone up by $2,500.	Yes
24961	I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	No
37699	In the meantime, we initiated an investigation in '93 to determine if cigarettes were so addictive that the Federal Food and Drug Administration could not prevent cigarette companies from advertising, marketing, and distributing their products to our children.	Yes
13431	The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	Yes
25503	And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	Yes
2487	That's the wrong way to go.	No
18437	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	No
1265	I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	Yes
6452	We're proud to be here.	No
35940	The G.I. was the reason why 46% of those who enlisted in the voluntary military until 1977 reported joining due to this reason.	Yes
15048	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	No
8305	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	No
16843	You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	Yes
20755	He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	No
23776	Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	Yes
24292	When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	No
37484	I opposed that decision during my presence at the National Governors Association.	Yes
35645	The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the agency has hired twelve public relations experts to explain its own existence to Americans.	Yes
10310	Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.	No
19147	These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	No
32543	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	No
29439	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	No
39099	Donald has targeted Captain Khan, the young man who made a valiant sacrifice in defense of the United States Army.	Yes
34570	Her crime is extremely serious due to her crookedness.	Yes
11045	When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	Yes
38536	The Harvard Business School study, which was recently published, suggested that the economy could conserve 30% to 40% of our current energy consumption solely in the commercial sector.	Yes
19638	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	No
17212	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	Yes
16497	And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	No
19476	And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	Yes
37863	Let me make it clear that the bill referred to by Mr. Nixon did not include Wilkes-Barre or Scranton, nor did it refer to West Virginia.	Yes
30160	The record does not show that.	Yes
13190	We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	No
37141	In the past eight years, teachers' salaries have experienced a fifty percent increase, while other salaries are only up to thirty-four percent.	Yes
20167	I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	No
34908	By the way, Senator Johnson was one of those who opposed that stance, voting with the seventy to the twelve.	Yes
37170	The spending only saw a 4 percent rise.	Yes
38655	George Bush once stated that Social Security is essentially a welfare system.	Yes
22981	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	Yes
38285	How the program that was administered during this administration functioned, but I am uncertain about its specifics. Thousands of automatic and AK-47 type weapons were distributed to individuals who later gave them to drug traffickers.	Yes
35143	Despite being born in Indiana, Donald went after a federal judge who was not trusted to handle the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because of his parents' Mexican heritage.	Yes
1297	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	Yes
33313	It means their job is tougher.	No
2422	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	Yes
523	If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	No
1109	In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	No
16157	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	Yes
35478	I have affirmed my support for a balanced budget during debates and in the ongoing debate throughout my fourteen years in Congress.	Yes
37823	As a member of the House Intelligence Committee in the Representatives, I worked tirelessly to understand nuclear arms control and how we can tackle non-proliferation and terrorist threats.	Yes
16311	That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	No
9999	And it's time for them to get serious on it.	No
35981	Small businesses, including millionaires and billionaires, are regarded by Governor Romney as a group.	Yes
7663	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	No
39084	The Republicans have been clamping down on the government to enforce their budget and plan on me, despite my two-year effort to provide tax cuts to 15 million working Americans.	Yes
37644	The combination of determination, decision-making, and tenacity has resulted in our archaic adversaries discussing peace in the Middle East.	Yes
18071	The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	No
34155	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
35539	He has become the first president to lose their job in 72 years.	Yes
24106	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	No
36922	The United States is significantly ahead of the world in terms of absolute differences, as opposed to twenty years ago.	Yes
8321	I think this is the wrong direction.	No
25126	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	Yes
36047	This administration has brought the new business to a low point, which hasn't been seen in 30 years.	Yes
16143	We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	No
38530	I want to caution my fellow citizens that the cost of not fixing the current system is far greater than the expense of ensuring its preservation for our children.	Yes
15256	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	No
1021	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	No
4244	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	No
11087	Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	Yes
34540	I have a fundamental deviation from the current administration, as with many other matters.	Yes
12553	It can and will grow even more in the next four.	No
8582	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	No
38393	We submitted the largest drug budget ever.	Yes
33622	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	No
13609	Just the ground rules here.	No
23331	Look at the record of the man running for the president.	No
11677	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	No
3667	Again, you can look it up.	No
38729	We are missing 9 million jobs.	Yes
25504	And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.	Yes
17426	I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	No
18317	And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.	No
36087	Despite my lack of explicit mention, I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, where I suggested that we should aim to achieve fuel efficiency ratings of 40 miles per gallon.	Yes
37917	"When this matter first came up, you initially said: ""It is our principle to draw a line and commit ourselves (to the cause) to defend these islands."	Yes
382	The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	No
716	Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	No
15147	But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	Yes
35850	The Congress has been pressured by him to delay the passage of nonproliferation legislation until an $8 billion program is established for private industry to produce enriched uranium, and Mr. Ford would not be unimpressed.	Yes
24985	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	No
39478	Of the nine million people I've put to work since taking office, 1.3 million are black Americans and another million speak Spanish.	Yes
38038	It takes approximately four minutes for the individuals responsible for launching nuclear weapons to comply with the order.	Yes
35253	The prospect of a nuclear Iran is almost here, four years in front of us.	Yes
37160	Keep in mind that Social Security income exceeds its costs until 2015.	Yes
8623	I think we're ready to move.	No
38970	There's no one in our government who can stop them from devaluing their currency.	Yes
12727	The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	No
6842	We're beginning to do it.	No
37589	Since his time in office, Mr. Ford has been advocating for the reduction of over $5 billion in subsidies for corporations, special interest groups, and individuals who generate their income through investments rather than labor.	Yes
21174	They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	No
1580	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	Yes
16556	I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	No
28923	If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	No
18679	The world is more dangerous.	No
35189	Our trade deficit with Japan has decreased and trade agreements or exports to Japan have increased by 85 percent in the last four years since we concluded them.	Yes
12845	He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	No
634	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	No
26231	To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	No
16091	So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	No
1348	That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	No
22584	Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	No
19743	But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	No
25762	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	No
29691	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	No
38950	According to the administration, they are in favor of conducting an immediate check.	Yes
27675	We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	No
21494	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	No
15970	In other states, we've done it.	Yes
36969	Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the primary locations where it's being fought.	Yes
12981	And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	No
14220	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	No
38140	My adversary was opposed to that.	Yes
35556	The fact that the Soviet Union is producing twice as many scientists and engineers as us doesn't make me happy.	Yes
8118	If we fail, then freedom fails.	No
37816	That is not a state program that does it.	Yes
22143	Coming out of World War II it made sense.	No
7420	And as president, I am committed to changing that.	No
15407	Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	No
37880	Our preparations are underway for a 600-ship navy today.	Yes
81	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	Yes
16358	This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	No
38948	We returned to them with $150 billion.	Yes
32074	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	No
17684	The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	No
35839	We have committed to spending $750 billion.	Yes
19312	I thought that was wrong.	No
35909	I think that my focus has been more on addressing health care issues than anything else in the United States, particularly among those who have experienced job loss, business failure, or parental leave due to illness.	Yes
36758	We constructed 84 new mental health treatment centers.	Yes
32582	I will be the president and we will get it done.	No
14062	This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	No
36661	Tiananmen Square's abuse was met with resistance from the Administration, making them the first significant nation to do so.	Yes
16544	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	Yes
22762	I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	No
36843	You must be aware of the fact that we are now energy-independent for the first time ever, as it sounds like you're either in the business or acquainted with those in your industry.	Yes
22130	All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	Yes
20067	And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	No
20113	And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
8952	And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	Yes
34680	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	Yes
34836	Observe your voter rolls and you will see millions of registered voters who are not supposed to be on them, even though it is not my responsibility.	Yes
13304	We can't settle for anything but the best.	No
18313	General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	Yes
10057	Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	No
19161	That's my difference with the President.	No
27788	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	No
22372	A message just won't do it.	No
14390	I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	No
6032	And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	No
13852	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	No
14242	You want to have a new program in this country.	No
37207	Despite the court's rejection of that reasonable regulation, they have accepted many more.	Yes
10072	And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	No
38818	Senator Kennedy expressed his belief that he had made a mistake by not advocating for free elections in Cuba during his time there.	Yes
37772	Joe Lieberman and I explored the effects of greenhouse gases by traveling worldwide.	Yes
37586	Men's salaries have not gone up.	Yes
35130	They're putting up millions of dollars of ads against me.	Yes
36680	According to Hillary, in the ninth month, it is permissible to remove a baby from its mother's uterus just before delivery.	Yes
33591	I want us to do more to help small business.	No
16870	And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	No
37005	In the past four months, five hundred thousand Americans have been placed on unemployment's tally.	Yes
36913	The authorization to store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel has been granted by Senator Obama.	Yes
37054	He suffered a loss of 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	Yes
30041	And maybe it's hardly doable.	No
37047	The carry interest provisions are being eliminated.	Yes
534	It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	No
344	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	No
29223	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	Yes
14938	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	No
12986	And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	No
38662	I can't remember who was in charge during the time of the Dole-Byrd Byrth-Dole bill, which was the first homeless bill to be introduced in the Senate.	Yes
1846	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	Yes
36401	The enemy has a greater number of troops in 60 countries.	Yes
8420	Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	Yes
3264	I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	No
32969	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	No
36257	Based on independent research, it has been determined that I offer three times the tax cut to middle-class families compared to Senator McCain's proposal.	Yes
34658	1700 communities are currently being worked on, rather than Congress, according to Ross.	Yes
34512	Although President Ford is respected, he should not be embarrassed to make the same statement since we have the highest unemployment rate in history.	Yes
8425	We need higher teachers' salaries.	No
19907	Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	No
27910	That will not help us compete with China.	Yes
36208	Remember that, which happened in 1993.	Yes
38604	As a means of standing up to my party's leaders, the first significant Senate bill I voted on for tort reform was not well-received by trial lawyers, who are particularly prominent in the Democratic Party.	Yes
17245	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	Yes
21186	And incidentally, one of them is this.	No
37997	Despite the bill's progress, I am not in a position to make any judgments on it for tonight.	Yes
34914	Clyde Prestowitz, a life-long conservative Republican and one of President Reagan's top trade advisers, has expressed his confidence in my candidacy by backing me on the matter of free and fair trade, while remaining realistic and not giving into politics everything the Bush administration did.	Yes
36266	He granted you the most substantial tax increase ever and attempted to take control of your healthcare system.	Yes
28445	I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	No
7094	And the take-home pay of the richest .	No
23001	This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	No
38787	The 49th position is occupied by women with health care, while families with healthcare are ranked 50th.	Yes
38569	The only difference is that Vice President Gore's plan does not include any new accountability measures.	Yes
37096	The total funding for Head Start would be around 5 billion.	Yes
32442	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	No
3347	I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	No
22132	We've got agreements, but they are still there.	No
35811	Taxes are a result of spending more than what is allocated for food, clothing, and lodging in this administration.	Yes
21462	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	No
19463	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	No
34796	Since George Washington, Muslims have been present in America.	Yes
19201	Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	Yes
11618	And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	No
35244	Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase for the wealthy that provided middle-class taxpayers with some relief, only this year.	Yes
18960	That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	No
38365	A number of Republican women were running for office and they are highly qualified.	Yes
11953	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	No
1758	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	No
9483	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	Yes
1028	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	No
1692	Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	No
28847	Are you for it without quotas?	No
39244	The first factor is that insurance companies cannot refuse coverage due to a pre-existing condition.	Yes
24287	We've got to make things here.	No
38946	His vetoes have not resulted in a $9 billion saving.	Yes
39130	It was not ten years ago that we had two and a half million or three million homeless people living on the streets and in doorways in this country.	Yes
24269	We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	Yes
13085	We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	No
35421	Eleven dictators governed Latin America during our time in office in 1953.	Yes
38853	The budget numbers he has presented indicate that his proposals for tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals are more significant than the combined spending on health care, education, and national defense.	Yes
12248	And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	No
2368	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	Yes
38425	I'm the only one who has balanced a government budget and consistently reduced spending, as I have presented 12 of them.	Yes
24304	We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.	No
36501	The Democratic platform and others claim a percentage of five.	Yes
37716	It takes him ten years to fix it.	Yes
26300	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	Yes
107	First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	No
36622	I want to point out that Senator Dole's vote resulted in a $900 billion increase in taxes.	Yes
12098	Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	No
10769	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	No
30399	.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	No
488	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	No
29329	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	No
38901	Who is the most prominent figure on the president's campaign trail in the deal we have been negotiating with BAC, US Air, KLM, and Northwest?	Yes
12541	Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	No
11985	I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	No
12630	I don't think they do, enough.	No
16484	And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	No
15563	I hear this talk about a blank check.	No
14705	I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	No
37739	The affordability of buying their own homes is currently being surpassed by less than one-third of the population.	Yes
25623	The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.	No
26845	So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.	No
16602	For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	Yes
29196	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	No
3963	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	No
6176	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	Yes
34185	Chris, we don't gain anything.	No
15463	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	Yes
20577	Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	No
9064	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	No
36658	Subsequently, our Embassy was blown up again.	Yes
12610	We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	No
8237	Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	No
38676	It seems oblivious that the DNC was infiltrated by Russia.	Yes
21098	Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	No
39109	The United States has never witnessed a president relinquishing their right to preemptively defend its nation, and I will always do so.	Yes
6838	Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	Yes
38623	Since 2002, we have had the highest number of U.S. troops killed this past year than in any other time period.	Yes
38212	We are expected to spend at least four billion dollars more per year, but we will only pay up to four and ninety billion over the course of a year.	Yes
32294	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	No
35481	The cancer rate in our country is the highest among all countries worldwide.	Yes
34641	There is no question that there has been an increase in violent attacks on Jews in France and Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations in recent years.	Yes
26529	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	No
39260	He is unaware that Russia carried out a significant attack on Georgia.	Yes
8009	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	No
20091	He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	No
21639	But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	Yes
922	I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.	No
15405	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	No
36896	The first step was to Somalia, where American citizens were dragged through the streets and rangers imprisoned for eight hours due to their lack of resources.	Yes
761	And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	Yes
35354	Certain army bases are required by the act to provide shelter for people during difficult times.	Yes
18052	And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	Yes
35166	'17 marks the beginning of its own downfall.	Yes
25054	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	No
7627	I believe we should have a stronger military force.	No
33150	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	No
14178	We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	No
26723	One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	No
20530	I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	Yes
25292	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	No
29790	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	No
24475	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	No
14458	Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	No
36069	As far as I know, it's been postponed until the following year.	Yes
22638	Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.	No
34541	As with many other matters, I have a fundamental deviation from the current administration on this issue.	Yes
38021	In 1969-70, you brought a right-wing congressman into the White House to plot my campaign against me for traveling to Russia, in contrast to the thousands of other Americans who did.	Yes
26674	"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	No
2571	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	No
24439	I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	Yes
29700	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	Yes
8660	Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	No
16764	In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	Yes
16393	Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	No
35705	The first point to consider is that I won't be subject to a $5 trillion tax cut.	Yes
36678	Governor Romney has been advocating for 18 months about a $5 trillion tax cut, which would also result in an additional $2 trillion in military spending.	Yes
32839	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	Yes
34828	We are responsible for paying about 73 percent of NATO's expenses, so I believe we should be entitled to it.	Yes
37759	Furthermore, the employment opportunities would not be obtainable currently.	Yes
15537	And that's why people are so concerned.	No
18789	And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	No
26239	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	No
9174	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	No
28318	They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	Yes
39111	The female population accounts for 41% of the total 10 million.	Yes
7110	They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	Yes
29279	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	No
38349	Before Medicare was introduced, the average senior citizen spent more of their income on healthcare than it did in 1965.	Yes
13738	And the people who have jobs --	No
34646	I've suggested a strategy to bring back manufacturing jobs by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing in our country, rather than sending them overseas.	Yes
21806	Let's start with a premise.	No
7532	Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	No
21084	A promise made will be a promise kept.	No
27091	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	No
21647	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	No
8083	It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	No
28865	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	No
2026	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	No
35593	The reluctance of banks to provide loans and mortgages is evident.	Yes
3824	We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	Yes
37782	Only one-twelfth of the size of Government has been increased, compared to other states' per capita spending and government size, as I can tell you.	Yes
19500	Talking about this and this.	No
38131	During his apology tour, the president visited countries in the Middle East and expressed disapproval of America.	Yes
38562	94% are sourced from the local level.	Yes
2149	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	No
24212	Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	No
29327	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	No
16671	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	Yes
7830	But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	No
21116	Let me tell you what your plan is.	No
7497	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	No
16769	For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	Yes
23084	I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	Yes
34468	Mr. Ford is altering his previous ideology considerably.	Yes
37795	Senator Obama has disputed that.	Yes
23977	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	No
20838	They went to Austin High School.	No
37663	I swore under oath that the initiative I took was at the request of the ranking members of House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and 'the rightful responsibility of my response.	Yes
8688	I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	Yes
2190	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	Yes
11686	During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	No
610	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	No
1280	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	Yes
1422	But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	Yes
38198	Regrettably, race remains an important factor, which can impact one's location, education options in public schools, and criminal justice system behavior.	Yes
34677	Our country has reduced the welfare rolls by half.	Yes

20981	I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	No

14983	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	No
19304	The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	No
31990	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	Yes
22206	So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	No
21311	Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.	Yes
25382	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	No
39503	Then we can't vote on it.	Yes
23697	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	No
16136	There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	No
20465	This is a major problem facing America.	No
16273	I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	No
35363	There has only been one governor who has been elected for four consecutive years, and that was me.	Yes
24355	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	No
26222	I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	No
8698	In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	Yes
36412	Even though Senator McCain would have argued for vouchers, I disagree with him on the matter as it does not provide enough information to support his school's goal of adding 2,000 more slots to the voucher program in D.C.	Yes
37474	As I mentioned earlier, the President has consistently emphasized that we should not make the same mistake as the dictator by hinting at their intention to use a firearm.	Yes
34704	I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent multiple missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to leave these islands.	Yes
35379	Afterward, several women have come forward and claimed that his actions were the same.	Yes
36509	Your campaign manager confirmed it just last week.	Yes
36599	I am opposed to any tax cut for the election year, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax reduction promised by my opponent in tonight's debate or the $27.5 billion tax savings pledged by President Carter on August 20th.	Yes
34878	The Washington Post and its extensive study suggest that a $100 billion problem will befall us after the election, if you believe it.	Yes
37952	How can New York City effectively govern when half of the black male population is unemployed and 40 percent of black children in certain cities are not able to finish high school?	Yes
8748	Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	No
32762	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	No
34719	He suggests a significant proposal: We need to hold re-assessment and solve the Iraq issue.	Yes
17975	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	No
3243	He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	Yes
17366	I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	No
32589	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	No
28197	The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	Yes
36972	The loss of health insurance coverage for five million people has been caused by this president.	Yes
35571	The news report from Richmond indicates that teenage cocaine use has decreased by 60% in the past few years, and this is a good indication.	Yes
6797	And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	No
2013	That doesn't get the job done.	No
38409	His job assignments have been dispatched to 12 countries, with Mexico being one of them.	Yes
1174	The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	No
11931	And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	No
9625	But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	No
37169	Independent experts have evaluated the plan and concluded that it could result in the creation of 10 million additional jobs.	Yes
1382	And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	No
36662	She referred to it as the gold standard.	Yes
36895	The bill for CHIPS was signed by me.	Yes
22259	Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	No
38218	In April, I declared that the presence of Russian peacekeepers in disputed areas in Georgia was not sustainable.	Yes
29275	So I will tell you this.	No
25523	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	Yes
14418	But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	No
20102	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	Yes
28296	It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	Yes
14868	I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	Yes
36220	Regrettably, our youth is still using marijuana to increase their drug use to approximately 11 percent, which is a tragedy.	Yes
25847	You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	Yes
36158	We remained loyal to democracy in Egypt.	Yes
35355	The act mandates the use of specific army bases to provide shelter for people during difficult times.	Yes
34057	He lost the Iowa caucus.	Yes
30406	Where did you find this?	No
28517	Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	No
37174	The NAACP has not been in touch with this president, making him the first president to do so.	Yes
32764	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	Yes
26249	I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.	No
6175	"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	No
9217	And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	No
19962	The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	No
18588	He is the leader of that country.	No
14757	Together we can get anything done.	No
32829	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	No
37507	That's where most people get their health care.	Yes
12798	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	No
20849	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	No
34630	A friend of hers, Soros, made a significant profit.	Yes
27281	And those teachers can make a difference.	No
35203	It is estimated that if Obamacare is repealed, 50 million individuals will no longer have access to health insurance.	Yes
34050	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	No
37658	Our assistance to Europe and Japan in the Far East has led to the complete recovery of some of our former enemies.	Yes
14955	I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	Yes
38923	Redlining, which is being enforced by HUD, is now a new law that has been outlawed.	Yes
21418	The dollar's gone through the floor.	No
35693	To create new markets, we've signed three trade deals and formed a task force for trade that targets individuals who are taking advantage of American workers or businesses while failing to create equal opportunities.	Yes
38283	He assured the elderly that their Social Security benefits would not be reduced, and he has pledged to pay them the same amount in trillions.	Yes
35316	The governor has referred to Medicare as a government HMO.	Yes
38341	Approximately $38,000 in earnings is subject to Social Security payroll taxes today.	Yes
4103	Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	No
3515	I do not think that they are.	No
18757	And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	Yes
34664	She speaks in support of the rebels.	Yes
25062	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	Yes
25923	A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	No
23546	To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	No
25895	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	No
24331	We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	No
8135	These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	No
2505	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	Yes
29006	You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	No
19744	It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.	No
37598	Due to the election year, they only added a small amount this year.	Yes
34891	Considering the number of fatalities caused by guns, it's worth noting that 33,000 people lose their lives annually.	Yes
11952	I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	No
34798	He declared that trickle-down economics was voodoo economica, and he has since become the most prominent practitioner of it.	Yes
34173	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	No
8192	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	No
29048	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	No
37641	In your time as Governor of Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked 48th out of 50 states due to the lack of support for policies like yours.	Yes
28915	I'm not proud of any record.	No
34988	The law explicitly forbids that.	Yes
24321	We're weak in the world.	No
20566	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
9016	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	No
22489	That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	Yes
13308	It must be a test of a man.	No
8592	Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	No
17015	And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	No
17131	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	No
10188	And so we're matching them up.	No
23751	We are not doing that today.	No
18056	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	No
36230	The budget's domestic side has not seen any increase in spending over the past four years, as measured in constant dollars.	Yes
37688	The Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, and 100,000 police officers were all passed.	Yes
9288	That's not the right course for America.	No
14511	We've turned the country upside down.	No
22306	Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	No
35682	Through my advocacy and the Congress's support, a significant mass transit program was established, costing eleven billion eight hundred million dollars over four years.	Yes
24835	You have to make tough calls.	No
38403	You should have never been in Iraq, but you did cast your ballot.	Yes
37358	Senator Dole may feel uneasy, but I've made more significant changes in terms of reducing government size than my Republican predecessors.	Yes
15242	Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	Yes
18944	It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	No
24771	Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	No
10635	And you know what you'll find?	No
24760	Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	No
24428	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	No
12328	What are we going to tell our children?	No
15176	First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	No
24761	He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	Yes
35434	My Medicare reform package only covers 5% of the elderly's benefits, which is an overstatement.	Yes
24536	First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	No
7980	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	No
12628	Do people want to be identified with us?	No
38149	Despite their efforts, the administration has admitted to not having completed the training, as they had requested a complete reprogramming of the funds when they returned to Congress just weeks ago.	Yes
37055	Ladies and gentlemen, he suffered a loss of 1.6 million.	Yes
12209	I can't emphasize to you how much.	No
20841	Here is the role of the federal government.	No
37693	The Illinois Senate introduced a bill that demanded life-saving treatment, which would have undermined Roe v. Wade.	Yes
32465	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	No
11522	I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	No
13343	One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.	No
13701	And I'm going to do that.	No
12140	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	Yes
2328	But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	Yes
8076	This is what I deeply believe.	No
36847	The Iran deal, which cost $150 billion and provided $1.7 billion in cash, is a match for Russia's actions with Assad and Iran, both of whom were considered powerful in the Middle East.	Yes
36610	I declared my commitment to providing tax relief to middle-class Americans.	Yes
21762	For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	Yes
1456	We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	Yes
2720	And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	No
27485	And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	No
34821	The president's job creation is costing us $9,000 less than the jobs we're losing.	Yes
13131	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	No
9645	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	No
39183	His constant statement is that Arkansas has a balanced budget, and they do, but he has an amendment for preserving the balance of the budget.	Yes
17617	[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	Yes
27120	And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	No
38563	A total of 94% is sourced from the local level.	Yes
4257	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	No
1296	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	Yes
3499	You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	No
38851	A significant portion of the funds is allocated to various charities, including the military.	Yes
39327	For the majority of the last twenty-five years, the Republican leadership has been against federal aid for education, medical care for the elderly and the Tennessee Valley, and natural resources.	Yes
17699	I think the business community wants to get involved.	No
12854	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	No
37350	The debt was settled after two years.	Yes
29827	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	No
35450	Our agreements, such as in Vietnam, have often caused us to feel embarrassed.	Yes
23709	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	Yes
34850	I vetoed the budget you passed, which included $30 billion in education budget cuts, to ensure that our children receive better education opportunities.	Yes
36888	In reality, I've never endorsed a $15 billion reduction in our defense budget.	Yes
35854	We seized a suitcase in an Arab state with nuclear materials at that time.	Yes
12565	We must have a great goal.	No
1409	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	No
16786	And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	Yes
38651	My tax payment amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars.	Yes
2746	We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.	Yes
7951	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	No
3081	So strong economy is very important.	No
16317	I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	No
2875	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	Yes
35952	A $1,000 deduction is available for those who are in the care of an elderly parent.	Yes
17998	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	No
38828	In this country, we have a coal stockpile that has been good for centuries and represents 50% of the world's coal supply.	Yes
37277	The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration has recognized my state's drug education and prevention program as a model for the rest of the nation.	Yes
162	So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	No
38174	The Congress has placed restrictions in the past few years.	Yes
34642	He is not considered the most liberal member of the United States Senate because he hasn't been present in many meetings.	Yes
28055	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	No
38428	In my state, there have been increases in taxes and service providers for middle-class Americans, while the wealthy have received tax breaks.	Yes
39022	The most significant budget ever put into action by any Administration in the history of the United States was twelve billion dollars, unless there was a severe recession.	Yes
35775	It's worth noting that the proposed bill was lower than what you had initially suggested, Mr. Nixon.	Yes
28381	It's just the right position to take.	No
26512	Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	No
1016	No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	Yes
8477	Well obviously my views are a little different.	No
3994	And we've got a choice.	No
16684	I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	Yes
2161	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	Yes
34530	The deficiency has been increasing for the past 12 years.	Yes
16805	This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	Yes
25821	So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	No
36526	The administration and Congress have not assisted him in carrying out his task.	Yes
37173	You have proposed a plan to raise the tax rate for profitable small enterprises from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
14754	"The ""we"" is you and me."	No
23618	I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	No
4197	It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	No
20940	Start asking the question, what do you know?	No
2657	And by the way, I've had that experience.	No
35405	I believed that the assault weapons ban should be extended, but was informed that it would not be implemented due to opposition from both Republicans and Democrats.	Yes
37286	The budget of $15 billion was sought to be reduced by him in 1975.	Yes
13921	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	Yes
18261	And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	Yes
25033	There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	Yes
22935	It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	No
22497	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	No
35585	We were unable to achieve the cuts that the president had promised and then doubled the amount.	Yes
12635	More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	Yes
914	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	No
18559	The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	No
26960	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	Yes
12884	And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	No
12811	We ought to make one last effort.	No
35313	After winning the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford repaid one and a half billion dollars with additional funds.	Yes
24561	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	No
35430	Based on the recommendations of the budget committees and projections, it appears that a $60 billion dividend will not be granted.	Yes
38048	This year has been the worst in American trade history.	Yes
27060	We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	Yes
32359	Well, I just want to say...	No
12548	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	Yes
39376	This could lead to an exacerbation of the deficit, as it is intended to cover the $7 trillion - $8 trillion in additional spending before reaching the current level of deficit.	Yes
16411	Thank you very, very much.	No
16526	Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	No
15494	We've had great success in my own state.	No
20736	I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	No
35979	To defeat the Syrian rebels who are resisting the Assad government, the Russian air force is making a strong effort to destroy Aleppo.	Yes
32774	I would go after Baghdadi.	No
133	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	No

27758	The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	Yes
23447	And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	No

18959	That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	No
38561	Undoubtedly, airport security has been funded by billions of dollars.	Yes
18746	If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	No
23208	And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	Yes
36479	Which action is more morally justifiable in foreign policy today, to lead the administration during the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food, with over 60% of it going to underdeveloped countries?	Yes
12316	I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	Yes
37764	A new spending of $2.2 trillion has been proposed by him.	Yes
39285	By bargaining for a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and individuals who ended up in jail, I was able to save $6.8 billion for the taxpayer over several years.	Yes
2296	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	Yes
39485	There were two to three commission reports, recommendations from the CIA, the State Department, and others, along with a warning from terrorists themselves for the third time.	Yes
10961	As you notice, he starts talking about government.	No
18883	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	No
37690	This year, we passed a bill in the Senate, but it was rejected by the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	Yes
38881	Our arsenal consists of 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads on land, sea, and air, which could result in the Soviet Union being destroyed forty times.	Yes
32488	That in itself is a big difference.	No
24954	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	No
26032	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	Yes
37115	It is common to hear about the gross national product, and I am of the opinion that the growth during this Administration exceeded eleven percent in seven years compared to the previous administration's growth rate of nineteen percent.	Yes
11742	I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	No
24150	And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	No
24691	Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	No
16454	Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	No
39055	A deferral system has been put in place to ensure that multinational corporations investing abroad do not pay taxes unless they return the money back to the United States.	Yes
27298	Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	No
23920	So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	No
16850	But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	No
36021	The United States is not bound by the treaty to defend Formosa and the Pescadores and to address any unlawful activities in that region.	Yes
34004	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	No
21886	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	No
38455	All reporters and fact checkers have contradicted this assertion, as stated by Governor.	Yes
38168	We ratified it in the House of Representatives.	Yes
34504	The first step is to work together with states and local people.	Yes
8493	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	No
36570	The Government has taken out millions of acres of public lands that were previously used for exploration of minerals and other resources, in the last year or so.	Yes
35291	MAD is a concept that advocates mutual destruction, where the only way to prevent them from using nuclear weapons is to ensure that your family lives as long as we do.	Yes

5766	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	No
38646	The tax rate for him was lower compared to the janitor who cleaned his office or the chauffeur who drove him to work.	Yes
28172	And you need to know the record here.	No
24956	I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	No

1404	And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.	No
37342	Given the significant reduction in Red Army numbers due to the arms control agreement signed between President Bush and Yeltsin, I am of the opinion that we cannot afford or need to maintain 150,000 troops in Europe.	Yes
6343	And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	No
37073	During that time, as I have stated before, we added an additional approximately nine million jobs, which is the highest number ever recorded.	Yes
928	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	No
34502	America's purpose is not what we want to achieve by eradicating the 400,000 desperate, hopeless, and defenseless Americans on disability grounds, who are confused and unable to defend themselves, as we did for 4 years.	Yes
28828	Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	No
14126	You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	No
38193	Approximately $30 billion is spent annually by Germany and Japan.	Yes
35817	Presently, there are many young people across the country who have chosen to avoid college or are burdened with debt of $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, and $60,000, making it difficult for them to pursue careers in basic science research.	Yes
29	Everybody ought to be in this thing.	No
22730	I meet with them all the time.	No
15428	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	No
15625	Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	Yes
34591	A $60 billion extra was spent on defense, and he caused many people to lose their jobs.	Yes

21861	Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	Yes
17206	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	No
12439	Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	No
6322	And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	No
12153	And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	Yes
37414	By the way, my tax cut is the most significant since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
37142	Besides those in defense positions, there are more individuals employed in the government.	Yes
22032	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	Yes
38009	The savings we obtain from Medicare, as per AARP, will enhance the system and extend the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	Yes
9271	Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	Yes
27488	And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	No
17008	Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	No
26057	You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	No
18984	Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	No
27530	So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	No
12585	Is our relative strength growing?	No
7881	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	No
17909	These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	No
35088	Those are the same people who experienced increased income and decreased taxes in the 1980s.	Yes
36251	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, which I support, and the Dingle-Norwood bill that the Governor opposes.	Yes
39043	After the Inter-American Bank's establishment, we passed an authorization to address the needs of Latin America and establish a partnership with them, rather than approving an aid bill.	Yes
14173	I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	No
30364	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	No
34478	We have exhausted our recovery funding for the addicts who are recovering.	Yes
13413	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	No
15041	Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	Yes
21884	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	No
34620	The percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds earning less than $12,000.	Yes
619	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	No
38484	Senator Obama failed to mention that he is proposing $800 billion in new spending and tax cuts.	Yes
19687	I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	No
10145	But let me mention another thing.	No
1760	But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	Yes
38315	Over the past few years, we have been producing more energy in industry and using 12% less energy than we did in 1973.	Yes
3058	And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	No
39101	It is now at a level higher than anything that was recorded since 1949 in terms of business investment.	Yes
15424	The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	No
21205	I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.	No
17238	Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	Yes
17814	And the result is exactly what we see.	No
38486	After my trip abroad to Hungary, I made several recommendations on the Hungarian refugee situation that were passed by Congress and signed into law.	Yes
5853	And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	No
757	Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	Yes
25260	And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	Yes
24940	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	No
37244	We have overseen the most substantial expansion in government since the Great Society.	Yes
18064	The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	Yes
36518	In numerous instances, they are illegal immigrants who have arrived here unlawfully.	Yes
21973	When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	No
24438	The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	No
35198	I provided a chance to all draft evaders and deserters in September 1974, inviting them to come forward and clear their records with the intention of regaining their good citizenship.	Yes
11224	We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	No
27770	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	Yes
4253	And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
2424	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	Yes
38832	The government imposes 17 new taxes, spends 1.5 trillion dollars, and creates 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
11225	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	No
38914	The majority of our containers entering the country, 95%, are not inspected today.	Yes
24814	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	No
18693	"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	No
30250	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	No
37164	The outcome was that we deployed, and the Soviets kept on deploying, before we negotiated from the brink.	Yes
3624	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	No
17278	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	No
38820	It has been asserted by Mr. Dulles that it is two to three times greater than ours.	Yes
39167	Over the past few years, a minority group within Small Loan Administration has been involved in lending black entrepreneurs money to start their business and then facing bankruptcy.	Yes
12346	That's an interruption, by the way.	No
34869	Pakistanis will need to acknowledge that the Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad was a signal from terrorists that they do not want their government to collaborate with them in combatting the Taliban and jihadist factions.	Yes
21959	But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	No
34267	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	No
36161	According to the most seasoned oil geologists, the Government has taken hundreds of millions of acres of land out of circulation that contains more oil and natural gas than we have used since drilling the first well 121 years ago.	Yes
3356	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	No
35925	The president of the US was informed that the issue amounted to $20 billion.	Yes
13515	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	Yes
37684	He is stating that he will cover the expenses by closing loopholes and deductions.	Yes
28991	There was a chance to get this done.	No
36174	The three-fold change from before the Affordable Care Act is that women cannot be charged more than men for health insurance.	Yes
39500	The Ford administration's most embarrassing failure, particularly in terms of human rights concerns, is his decision not to send a presidential delegation to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and other countries to discuss the issues of missing combatants in those conflicts.	Yes
8138	He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	Yes
27685	But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	No
29964	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	No
39314	Senator Kennedy delayed the passage for 100 days, even though it was almost done, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	Yes
17014	I believe that we can work together.	No
29373	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
29657	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	No
2247	Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	No
18019	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	Yes
35718	The principle that the polluters should pay for toxic waste dumps, unless it was relatively recent, was terminated.	Yes
19975	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	No
29927	But let me just tell you.	No
34556	If the wealthy pay 62% of their taxes today, my plan is for them to do so.	Yes
34743	Your initial action upon taking office was to create the stimulus package and distribute $16 billion in pork from your campaign to America.	Yes
16761	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	Yes
36055	The number of children born to them is 4 million American citizens and 15 million people.	Yes
39418	Additionally, they have slashed defense spending by two billion dollars.	Yes
32913	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	No
25773	We have to respect one another.	No
16362	I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	No
38122	Actually, he increased it by two.	Yes
16679	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	No
35782	North Korea has obtained nuclear weapons in the meantime.	Yes
35187	I find it noteworthy that during my presidency, I have vetoed fifty-six bills in two years.	Yes
39048	The Truman Administration witnessed a fivefold increase in prices, as compared to the Eisenhower Administration.	Yes
37629	We're keeping our workforce for the future.	Yes
32276	But the name is there.	No
35761	It was terminated in the Rules Committee.	Yes
36270	The second highest tax rate for businesses in the United States is present.	Yes
15793	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	No
22188	And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	Yes
12520	And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	No
36238	The number of uninsured individuals in our country is 35 million, and I see them on a regular basis.	Yes
31941	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	No
24447	America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	No
33940	Why don't you give back the money?	No
34241	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	No
14517	But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	Yes
35809	Incomes and salaries have decreased.	Yes
33606	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	No
8723	But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	No
27613	You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	No
35169	It's estimated they could blow the budget out of hand by $900 billion.	Yes
24696	The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	Yes
39454	During the last debate, it was revealed that he had not paid any federal income tax, which is particularly alarming.	Yes
36228	One-fifth of our gross national product is allocated to health care.	Yes
18615	That's why it's essential we win.	No
8611	The means are at question.	No
36068	I have learned that it has been prolonged until next year.	Yes
16480	For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	Yes
9734	And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	No
10563	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	Yes
13240	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	No
8786	And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	No
17185	I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	No
35296	A study conducted by Princeton University, as per Mr. May, indicates that American cities are currently in worse shape than they were in 1960.	Yes
3766	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	No
22859	Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	No
5809	And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	No
37648	Despite having worked on these projects for 12 years, I'm the only one who hasn't been involved in anything associated with Washington in the last 20 years.	Yes
18208	We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	No
4005	Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	Yes
12915	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	No
35685	Upon concluding this term, he has not made any headway in terms of arms control, but rather is involved in a hazardous arms race.	Yes
36995	In the beginning of my tenure, I contacted the attorney general and U.S. attorneys and established a task force across the country to handle individuals who use firearms to commit crimes.	Yes
27148	That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	No
10867	Senator Obama has opposed that.	Yes
30083	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	No
21661	These people are hurting in the inner cities.	No
8294	Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	No
16616	Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	Yes
18939	I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
16464	We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	Yes
25693	Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	No
1463	Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	No
17579	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	Yes
35488	The Social Security Act was voted against in 1935, with 94% of Republicans voting against it.	Yes
9035	And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	No
35725	Although poverty has increased, it is not as high as it was in the previous years before we arrived.	Yes
16149	And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	No
18103	Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	Yes
7295	I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	Yes
17520	I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	No
23879	Many would trade for it.	No
19094	Four years ago you took me on faith.	No
28166	I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	No
34920	The Kurdish people have been our most trusted allies in Syria and Iraq.	Yes
1425	But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	No
38747	It is estimated that the government spends around $1.4 billion annually on this.	Yes
24480	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	No
38643	Despite living on an average Social Security check of about $778 per month, 17 million Americans cannot support themselves individually and can only depend on the social security system.	Yes
21592	That happened when I was president.	Yes
37029	Due to my disbelief in quotas and lack of support for them among Americans, I had to veto two civil rights quota bills.	Yes
38227	With record-breaking profits of $12 billion, Exxon Mobil can now afford to raise its expenses and offer a break for families who are struggling to afford food and college education.	Yes
34410	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	Yes
39091	Prior to my presidency in 1992, the Cuba Democracy Act was passed by Congress and I vigorously enforced it.	Yes
38586	We provided Ambassador Glaspie with written instructions.	Yes
31867	You say who's making these deals?	No
27010	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	No
21380	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	Yes
15110	And we've been guilty of that.	No
2494	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	Yes
38628	Math and science are showing signs of progress.	Yes
35946	It's worth noting that we had a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered the governor as effectively as this one does to the President.	Yes
8317	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	No
29282	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	Yes
8352	As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	No
16888	We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	Yes
34430	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	No
19888	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	No
24627	And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	No
33388	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	No
1219	Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	Yes
39182	The balance of Arkansas' budget is a constant topic of discussion, but his balanced budget amendment is worth considering.	Yes
17327	But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	No
36946	She is exorbitantly raising taxes on all of us.	Yes
25536	I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	No
10962	He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	No
38250	Roughly a thousand people raised their hands.	Yes
25468	The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	No
8958	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	No
3564	And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	Yes
352	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	No
3150	I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.	No
39039	We have a crime bill that has 60 death penalties, 100,000 police officers, and the assault weapons ban, as well as fewer people on welfare rolls (pre-welfare rolls by two million), increased child support by 50 percent, reduced overage rates, lower overall crime rates than before welfare reform.	Yes
3478	We haven't seen the language yet.	No
21086	That's the difference of opinion.	No
37042	In the past few days, an extension of the loophole has been expanded and given away $43 billion in prizes, including favors to the oil and gas industry and those who import ceiling fans from China.	Yes
20334	If I could respond to that.	No
6015	The technology is there and we have to drill now.	No
35579	In my capacity as Vice President, I journeyed to the Philippines, where I campaigne fervently for human rights, demanded the release of Aquino, and accomplished progress that had been delayed on Subic and Clark airfield bases.	Yes
37297	A tax cut of $89 billion was given to the top one percent of income earners in America last year.	Yes
22263	Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	No
35634	The private sector in my state is experiencing a surge in employment.	Yes
2349	It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	Yes
35709	Their capabilities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies have not been comparable to those of four years ago.	Yes
36708	The Administration and Mr. Nixon's opposition to reserving medical care for the elderly under Social Security to provide them with some safety is still unclear to me.	Yes
34628	Due to the unique circumstances and coalition we had helped create, we were able to prevent the massacre in Libya when we entered the country.	Yes
26149	You should expect that from both of us.	No
35728	Our military is the strongest, and I will take all necessary measures to maintain that strength if I become president.	Yes
24317	We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	No
23644	I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	No
26125	Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	Yes
22642	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	Yes
36149	The idea of open borders is not fair, as it could lead to someone crossing the border and becoming a citizen under her plan.	Yes
8218	I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	No
795	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	No
6127	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	Yes
37264	While I am hopeful for its rise, I don't believe that it will be as successful if we continue the policies we implemented against Cuba in recent years and neglect our needs in Latin America.	Yes
34692	He stated that the FBI was rigged and concluded that there was no case.	Yes
6622	They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	No
39355	The creation of an imaginary company, the ability to export products and avoid paying all taxes on them is within a company's rights.	Yes
38727	Human beings are affected by human beinglessness, as Mr. Ford appears to be ignoring the fact that there are five hundred thousand more people out of work than there were three months ago and two and a half million more than when he first took office.	Yes
23933	Decide who you think will do the job.	No
36489	The Navy, you cited, and we have more ships than in 1916.	Yes
3437	And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	No
38523	We are now facing opposition from Iran and Russia.	Yes
2135	My grandfather died a while back.	No
24626	Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	No
19808	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	Yes
37919	This is why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the previous administration, which had done so twice before.	Yes
21159	And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	No
35807	During my two-year tenure, I have been working with the leaders mentioned by the president for more than 20 years.	Yes
23044	And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	Yes
18801	We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	Yes
22694	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	No
22198	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	No
32469	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	Yes
37603	If the governor were to redirect 1 out of every $6 into the stock market, it would result in a trillion dollars being depleted from the Social Security Trust Fund over the next decade, and Social Safety will be completely defunded in 2021.	Yes
22001	So at least we have time to work with it.	No
16541	It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	No
3033	In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	Yes
35699	Drugs are infiltrating the border.	Yes
37953	Despite the fact that 40 percent of black children in certain cities have dropped out of high school, New York City has a high unemployment rate among its black male population.	Yes
15742	Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	Yes
11028	I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	No
37050	Governor Clinton stated that he would have voted for the majority, but may not have been in favor of the minority view and allowed the implementation of sanctions.	Yes
35054	The cost of insurance for him is lower than that of the nearby Mom and Pop's store.	Yes
38718	In terms of our stance on the working class, I am the only member who has served as President of my union for six years and remains a full member.	Yes
11365	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	No
38652	During Mr. Nixon's presidency, we spent three and a half million dollars on the White House and its staff.	Yes
26472	But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	No
25864	What service are you in?	No
17448	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	No
34826	Our capacity to effectively deal with the Central American conflict has been compromised by our inability to work together in a constructive and honest manner with Mexico, Costa Rica, and other nations.	Yes
7047	We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	Yes
1959	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	No
12794	So one more effort should be made.	No
15573	Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	No
1848	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	No
8026	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	No
13732	I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	No
39309	There has been a slight increase of over 3 percent in growth.	Yes
12741	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	Yes
24743	Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	Yes
12932	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	No
28833	This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	No
37565	The reduction of pollution from off-road diesel engines is 90 percent, as agreed upon by us.	Yes
28162	That is a national outrage.	No
34918	We are now defending ourselves.	Yes
12998	America has not been standing still.	No
34696	My appointment history shows that I've appointed more than 130 people.	Yes
20644	I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
709	And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	No
12888	First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	No
27803	We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	No
13508	Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	No
22110	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	No
27209	And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	No
36396	The tax system we have is so unbalanced that it is a disgrace, as I mentioned earlier. Moreover, 25% of the tax revenue goes to the top 1 percent of wealth in this nation.	Yes
19297	I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	No
20376	It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	No
1780	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	No
28754	We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	No
36049	I was the first president to order affirmative action through various cabinet departments, including the Department of Commerce, in November 1975. This action was implemented to ensure that no American businessman or organization would discriminate against Jews due to an Arab boycott.	Yes
37217	The money that was allocated to Fisher House was used to construct homes for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
7661	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	No
19795	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	No
14888	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	Yes
37876	The energy - uh policy of our nation has not been established under the current administration.	Yes
38244	You'll be covered if you switch jobs.	Yes
14852	That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	No
33268	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	No
5978	So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	No
30118	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	Yes
4240	I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	Yes
12703	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	No
37240	The number of warheads aimed at us today has increased by more than 2,000 since his inauguration, but it does not provide any additional support.	Yes
35446	I'm not surprised by what he said because it's completely false.	Yes
24550	This is a relevant question here tonight.	No
34900	Taxes were lowered for the 15 million working Americans.	Yes
16705	I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	Yes
7475	And some would say maybe me more so than others.	No
38688	A recent report has shown that we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the past 13 months.	Yes
15773	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	Yes
22863	Let me talk about North Korea.	No
1855	And I think that would be a mistake.	No
24847	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	Yes
1009	I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	No
24622	To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	No
26089	We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	No
35467	As an example, we proposed a budget of approximately $12 million to add four to five hundred new employees to the National Park Service.	Yes
39404	The federal treasury is not exempt from the cost increase.	Yes
35661	The countries are self-governing and autonomous, possessing their own territorial boundaries, and the United States does not recognize that they are under the control of the Soviet Union.	Yes
7678	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	No
36592	Our police force is being outmatched in multiple locations.	Yes
38337	I believe that individuals earning over $250,000 annually should return to the rates they had during Bill Clinton's administration, which led to a surplus of millionaires and created 23 million new jobs.	Yes
37098	They're open to working with us.	Yes
20257	It's a difference of opinion.	No
17009	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	No
36947	Despite this, she is exorbitantly raising taxes on all of us.	Yes
8072	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	No
39122	A record-breaking 1.2 million dollars were ours in bankruptcy.	Yes
28555	If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	No
20963	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	No
1249	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	No
37601	Russia is persistently battling us in the U.N.	Yes
12773	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	No
14576	He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	Yes
18725	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	No
17627	And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	Yes
22924	Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	No
11919	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	No
3508	And I promise you that that will happen.	No
18629	I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	No
9936	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	No
34792	There was no indication of any US weapons found on the battlefield during the search.	Yes
38032	The CBO predicts that Obamacare's implementation next year will result in the loss of insurance for up to 20 million people.	Yes
37494	His objections included the F - 14 fighter, the M – 1 tank, and the B  1 bomber, as well as his desire to reduce the military's pay and bring half of the US forces back to Europe.	Yes
640	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	No
36453	President Clinton's bid for governor in 1990 was unsuccessful as he promised to serve his term as president.	Yes
16302	Who's been managing this system?	No
20852	And so does Michael Feinberg.	No
7792	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	No
25273	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	No
38065	In contrast, the deficit was $200 billion.	Yes
38397	Although the banks and lenders were not putting themselves in danger, they were taking billions out of the system.	Yes
35284	It was my original suggestion a long time ago that we should scrutinize every government department and agency.	Yes
36164	We've never witnessed anything like this happening in our elections before.	Yes
4032	No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	No
2917	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	No
33967	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	Yes
13146	Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	No
35364	According to numerous studies, Medicare has lower administrative costs compared to private insurance, which is why seniors are generally satisfied with it.	Yes
32011	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	Yes
29777	Property crime is down 40 percent.	Yes
38482	The president has converted a $5.6 trillion surplus into deficits.	Yes
11666	But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.	No
9251	And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	Yes
17161	I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	No
35437	In the last seven and a half years, we have built more schools than in the past two decades.	Yes
1040	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	No
38323	Your president, John, was the one who you agreed with in 90 percent of cases when he oversaw this spending surge.	Yes
37929	It is my belief that they are aware of the commission that was brought in a year ago to recommend excellence in education.	Yes
35525	The product liability bill was passed by them, but I vetoed it, so I believed that's what he meant and actually wanted to sign it.	Yes
16623	For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	Yes
32834	Take a look at upstate New York.	No
28367	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	No
21378	Here's some thing that'll help.	No
37191	When he first indicated in October of last year that if the president had the power to stop a national emergency strike, it would be through compulsory arbitration.	Yes
27997	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	No
39184	The world doesn't see North Korea as simply continuing to export their nuclear technology, despite Russia's announcement that they will not follow Nunn-Lugar anymore.	Yes
18837	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	No
12976	I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	No
34431	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	No
2005	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	Yes
22089	Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	No
22494	I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	Yes
38000	According to the Federal Reserve Board, the amount of money that is available for purchase will be held within the range of four to four and a half and seven and an half.	Yes
38744	The placement of police officers near schools where children carry weapons has led to a decrease in crime in communities where such incidents are prevalent.	Yes
37159	Despite our desire for more funding, we are currently providing them with significantly more than ever before.	Yes
35557	I'm dissatisfied that the Soviet Union is producing twice as many scientists and engineers as we do.	Yes
471	It's as simple as that.	No
37889	In addition, John McCain and I have a proposal for establishing an advisory board that would eliminate corporate giveaway loopholes.	Yes
18968	And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	No
35930	For the first time in American history, a religious test would be involved.	Yes
34025	I'm not looking at anything now.	No
31922	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	No
18243	We're standing with you strong.	No
27262	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	No
13427	And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	Yes
15490	We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	No
27586	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	No
20935	That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	No
17908	And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	No
37869	A $2,000 government rebate can be obtained by families with a downsize of $30,000 to purchase private health care.	Yes
32085	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	Yes
1902	Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	No
2582	That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	No
2641	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	No
8160	The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	No
37837	My vote is in favor of the Brady bill, which would mandate a nationwide waiting period until Virginia can automate its records.	Yes
37531	The only difference between me and other businessmen with a diverse range of businesses is my lack of litigation experience.	Yes
35052	I've witnessed instances where abortions were used as a form of birth control, for goodness' sake.	Yes
39161	This is the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to prohibit weapons.	Yes
36798	We have a greater number of individuals who meet the criteria.	Yes
17776	But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	No
22621	And that was the serious, serious threat.	No
25987	They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	Yes
17765	Whose taxes will you raise?	No
3021	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
38552	They were not part of the treaty area when it was passed in fifty-five.	Yes
3670	Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	No
35131	I am being targeted with millions of dollars in ads.	Yes
8788	So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	No
12704	They have to include the other countries of Latin America.	No
36465	My health care bill included a recommendation for insurance companies to offer contraceptive coverage to all those who are covered by my plan.	Yes
39441	... Proposed more countries including Japan, Korea, and Saudi Arabia to acquire them.	Yes
19151	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	No
36267	His biggest tax increase in history was a result of his attempt to take control of your healthcare system.	Yes
2218	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	No
3731	Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	No
26630	Did you say you're unemployed?	No
39423	An amendment was also his favored choice, but it was lost by fortunately, as it would have drawn a line by eliminating those islands and negating the president's ability to defend them if he suspected an attack on Formosa.	Yes
19797	When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	No
19153	Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.	Yes
17793	Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	No
39072	Assuming the markets recover, taxpayers can hold onto their assets for an extended period of time and eventually regain ownership, as was the case with the Great Depression. Roosevelt's purchase of homes during this time resulted in a rise in home values that ultimately led to government profits.	Yes
22298	It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	No
37081	The person who received the document was from the same area and recognized that the instructions were in direct opposition to my Executive order from December 1981, which prevented political assassinations.	Yes
18293	And that's what I did with that vote.	No
32654	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	No
36292	The point is that we have finally witnessed Republicans and Democrats negotiating and coming to a package.	Yes
37252	He employed undocumented workers to construct the Trump Tower.	Yes
39431	In the meantime, if I agree to the tax bill mentioned by Mr. Gannon, the last two tax bills will raise the minimum tax for all affluent taxpayers.	Yes
6119	And this is your plan, John.	No
16821	Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
38290	The president has not had a meeting with the civil rights leadership of our country.	Yes
13448	Particularly some of the smaller producers.	No
27375	I had the chance to be governor of a state.	No
18819	I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	No
27524	Bob, let me just respond.	No
16394	And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	No
6114	And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	No
8341	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	No
39073	If we were to recover the $700 billion, it would only take a few years.	Yes
12551	In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	No
491	I think it is good.	No
39236	My history of doing that goes back for a long time.	Yes
12735	Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	No
9394	That's not an energy strategy for the future.	No
37600	The U.N. is still being fought against by Russia on multiple occasions.	Yes
13644	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	No
17194	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	No
39210	It's worth noting that the oil depletion allowance, which accounts for eighty percent of those involved in depletetion, means that you won't receive a significant portion of your revenue if you move to the region where he mentioned.	Yes
4361	And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	No
27467	I would indict him for it.	No
19276	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	Yes
19550	And institutions are beginning to function.	No
19411	We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	Yes
23161	Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	No
34673	First things first, I signed a tort reform bill addressing civilian aviation two years ago.	Yes
11770	The governor mentioned it earlier.	No
11825	But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	No
18732	And I think this will work.	No
23875	Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	No
662	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	No
32480	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	Yes
26686	Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	Yes
19827	So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	No
20773	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	Yes
31852	Well, I actually agree with that.	No
13716	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	Yes
6506	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	No
14476	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	No
1788	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	Yes
2086	... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	No
28570	None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	No
29109	We also have to make the economy fairer.	No
36552	In the end, we received a greater number of votes than his score, but they ultimately decided to terminate the agreement.	Yes
28457	So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	No
20313	Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	Yes
1322	But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	No
26085	One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	No
21876	A senator runs every 6 years.	No
21925	Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	No
13511	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	No
7136	We're not allowed to vote on it.	Yes
11405	I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	No
37517	The tax scheme in question is half the size of their previous one, which incurred a 250 billion dollar loss.	Yes
8143	I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	No
36475	It appears that they're urging individuals to engage in physical altercations and violence, which is against the law.	Yes
19156	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	Yes
35975	I proposed a crime bill that would have put 100,000 police officers on the streets, ban assault weapons, and address capital punishment issues such as drug trafficking.	Yes
14838	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	No
21029	They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	No
25418	Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.	No
18294	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	No
26765	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	No
17028	It was a superb occasion.	No
1170	And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	No
24441	I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	Yes
24695	The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	Yes
35484	The voucher's inability to keep up with health care inflation resulted in an estimated annual cost of $6,000 for the average senior.	Yes
31909	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	No
12636	I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	No
18010	And that's what they are.	No
7896	I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	No
32191	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	Yes
26056	This is the United States of America.	No
33311	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	Yes
36240	A number of government agencies were aware that he was prioritizing military aid over developing weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
38808	That's just one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	Yes
19150	The President trusts the government.	No
5501	Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	No
3977	So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	No
25238	This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	No
32512	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	Yes
6266	Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	No
34626	The United States' debt has been boosted by him in four years, more so than all of George Washington to Ronald Reagan combined.	Yes
33216	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	Yes
7889	I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	No
37721	Pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals are even more potent, but in smaller amounts.	Yes
37911	I have instructed an inquiry to be conducted.	Yes
34959	About four months ago, the Wall Street Journal's front page reported that NATO is establishing a significant terror unit.	Yes
4172	Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	No
19115	It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	No
1423	Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	Yes
15208	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	Yes
33464	Now we can talk about Putin.	No
36638	I voted against it, but Senator Obama supported it.	Yes
25263	The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	Yes
34722	The first vote I attended in Congress since 1965 was to determine whether or not to give a little more attention to cigarettes.	Yes
35349	My proposal includes ceasing the sale of processing plants to Germany and France for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
7613	In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	No
37799	The United States has never experienced a tax cut during wartime.	Yes
39239	Due to its potential to disrupt the system and cut Medicare, I vetoed the bill.	Yes
8999	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	Yes
6212	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	No
20206	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	No
16963	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	Yes
30340	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	Yes
23007	And I accept what the president has said.	No
14438	Come on, that's not leadership.	No
22893	In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	No
35303	Despite the previous administration's limitations, families with no income were still eligible for low-interest college loan options.	Yes
37887	Across the last four years, cocaine use in America has decreased by 30 percent, while casual drug use has dropped by 13 percent.	Yes
19997	I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.	Yes
37242	Haiti's democratically elected president is now in power.	Yes
26903	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	No
23970	In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	No
19556	Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	No
36188	There are numerous sources that confirm his involvement in the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
32817	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	Yes
35288	The atomic energy lobby has persuaded Mr. Ford to allow private industry to carry out reprocessing or enrichment, rather than the current government plants.	Yes
37195	Before I address your question, let me clarify that the Social Security cut of 25 percent was the only one ever made in connection with a significant tax increase in 1977, which involved reducing benefits for all Americans born after 1916.	Yes
17594	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	No
26402	The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	Yes
6193	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	No
7194	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	No
675	Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	No
22823	Didn't bring in enough nation.	No
3283	But let me comment on the report.	No
25566	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	No
34750	Even though there is no shortage of dollars, many countries are still swapping against our products.	Yes
36293	It is worth mentioning that we have finally witnessed Republicans and Democrats engaging in negotiations to come up with a package.	Yes
1922	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	No
6083	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	No
32155	Premiums have gotten too high.	Yes
7784	This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	No
12472	The warning signs are clear.	No
37879	Due to the Geneva Conference, Indochina was spared from losing.	Yes
28179	I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	No
26570	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	No
38542	The number of wounded has 30,000, and al Qaeda is now more powerful and resilient than ever since 2001 from a national security standpoint.	Yes
24470	And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	No
34730	A bipartisan commission was responsible for examining the findings of two distinguished economists, which suggested that we could obtain approximately 40, 45, or 50 billion dollars.	Yes
9019	But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	No
18814	We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	Yes
20746	Those are very clear differences.	No
19348	Let's be honest about it.	No
8421	Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	No
39223	Assuming Germany can keep costs under control and Hawaii can provide healthcare for 98% of its citizens at a lower cost, Rochester, New York can do it with two-thirds of the remaining expenses, I believe America can also meet those challenges.	Yes
39370	It's worth mentioning that we've had more than 200 distinct trade deals in the past four years.	Yes
29117	How are we going to do it?	No
38213	At least four billion dollars will be required per year, with a maximum of four and nine-tenths the amount we are currently spending.	Yes
16642	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	No
549	But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	No
9377	And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	No
96	Panama is a friendly country.	No
28878	So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	No
18159	Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	No
587	I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	No
23403	Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	No
35429	I advocated for and the Congress supported a general revenue sharing program that provides cities and states with over six billion dollars per year in cash to provide various services.	Yes
32926	I'm shocked to hear that.	No
28226	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	No
34823	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was tired of people being trapped in a system that was isolating them and making their children more susceptible to mistreatment.	Yes
19926	We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	Yes
38415	Currently, we are spending about three billion five hundred million dollars.	Yes
21403	I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	No
1387	Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	Yes
21980	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	Yes
12407	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	Yes
14449	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	No
16232	I've spelled out my position.	No
12966	Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	No
26120	We've got this country going in the right direction.	No
13349	He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	No
36020	The treaty does not mandate the United States to defend anything other than Formosa and the Pescadores, or to deal with any acts against that region.	Yes
12872	If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	No
9808	He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	No
28448	We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	No
35007	Numerous other statistics demonstrate that the grant programs are more extensive than ever, ensuring the well-being of more individuals than they have ever done before.	Yes
13126	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	No
14913	Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	Yes
37831	Despite the belief that we need to do more, the President of Brazil has acknowledged that his efforts towards this issue may have led to a decline in prestige in Latin America.	Yes
37874	To address the issue of energy, Governor Reagan has proposed a new energy policy that will abolish or significantly modify the windfall profits tax, returning 80% of the $227 billion raised so far to oil companies, eliminating the Department of Energy, and prioritizing solar power over other options.	Yes
36727	I asserted that we would offer guarantees, which was the key factor in enabling these companies to escape bankruptcy.	Yes
30432	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	No
580	And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	Yes
18264	There's a sense of American occupation.	No
1208	The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	Yes
38873	The House's failure to pass it was due to its defeat by eleven votes.	Yes
24987	And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	No
25145	-- me, or your own eyes?''	No
15310	That is the way it will stay.	No
19904	I feel strongly about education.	No
26804	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	No
34965	Prior to General McCaffrey, or even before you had a surgeon: someone in your position suggested that we should consider legalizing drugs.	Yes
35005	Over the course of 38 years, a single party has held control of the House of Representatives, leading to pathetic post offices and bank overdrafts.	Yes
450	I do not favor abortion.	No
38175	A few of the limitations that have been imposed by Congress in recent times.	Yes
14495	The people need to take their government back.	No
7492	And I think we're both very lucky.	No
37722	After removing an authoritarian ruler who had murdered Americans, the aftermath of the Benghazi tragedy was not forgotten as thousands of Libyans rallied to support America.	Yes
9022	But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.	No
39237	Doing that has been a part of my history for many years.	Yes
6346	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	Yes
19993	It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	No
38877	Governor Jim Hunt's North Carolina plan is the basis for this, and it has a great track record.	Yes
780	You're judged by the entire record.	No
20168	I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	No
38579	Our economy experienced a slower pace of economic growth this year than last and the previous year, with only 32 million people on food stamps at his time in office.	Yes
14464	But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.	No
8153	And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	No
3648	We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	No
34589	Due to the current frozen credit markets, both small and large businesses are unable to obtain loans.	Yes
8670	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	Yes
35265	The principles that are emphasized include human rights, human dignity and free enterprise, as well as freedom of expression and elections.	Yes
36216	The previous administration supported me, even though I could have done a lot more in my role during that period, and they were there to support this revolution.	Yes
13658	And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	Yes
21123	That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	Yes
38293	The situation is unusual because after serving in Washington, you can cash in on the job, become a foreign lobbyist, earn $30,000 per month, take maternity leave to work on presidential campaigns, maintain good relationships with donors, and then come back.	Yes
21110	If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	No
15425	We must have a society that's just and fair.	No
19747	We've lost credibility around the world.	No
32032	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	Yes
26616	So we need to preserve the system.	No
39394	The Baltics, along with Poland and Hungary, are free from any form of oppression.	Yes
23578	It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	No
23521	I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	No
18526	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	No
37450	The stock market has tripled in value over the last 12 years, having previously experienced a triple-dip recession.	Yes
29793	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	No
23342	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	Yes
10741	And the last point I just want to make.	No
38871	"Are we heading towards an atomic bomb fated world scenario, where not only 5 countries but also dozens of smaller nations are permitted to develop atom bombs due to our top leadership's inability ""proliferation"" is allowed?"	Yes
34875	The campaign to impose 100,000 police officers on American streets was my own initiative.	Yes
35514	The number of women living in poverty has increased by 3.5 million since the president's tenure.	Yes
38575	My team, consisting of Democrats and Republicans, worked to reduce the discretionary domestic budget by one trillion dollars.	Yes
35267	It's a matter of great importance that Pell Grants are valued at 6 billion dollars.	Yes
38608	He fails to mention that he will be taxing health benefits for the first time in his life.	Yes
626	But look, let me sum it up.	No
2831	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	No
36576	The federal government increases approximately 6% of the funds.	Yes
38137	Almost as big as China's economy is the economy of Latin America, in reality.	Yes
4068	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	No
36151	You know, I advocated for the inclusion of the 209 American citizens who were present in Richmond just a few days ago.	Yes
27252	Trade grows about 12 percent year.	Yes
8506	It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	No
13714	We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	Yes
29502	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	Yes
6643	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	Yes
36426	The White House staff, when I was inaugurated, had a workforce of approximately five hundred employees.	Yes
21251	I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.	No
35977	His statement indicated that he would initiate military operations in Pakistan.	Yes
19104	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	Yes
13458	Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	No
14051	And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	No
10985	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	No
36620	The Governor's program aims to increase taxes and expenses, amounting to $150 billion in new taxes with an additional $220 million spent.	Yes
39489	In California, the return of money to the people and reduction in Government spending resulted in lower inflation than the national average.	Yes
1085	Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.	No
6809	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	No
35518	Roughly half of the population in this nation has access to retirement savings.	Yes
3168	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	No
36857	The jury found them guilty.	Yes
15153	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	No
13999	He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	Yes
16255	"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	No
34887	The United States experienced a twofold increase in taxes and grew by $318 billion in budgets during the 5-year period before we took office.	Yes
12948	I served it uh - in the war.	No
37225	Community development funds are available to cities through the federal government's funding, which amounts to approximately three billion three hundred million dollars.	Yes
19767	It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	No
34399	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	No
35078	The majority of the tax reductions were directed towards low- and middle-income Americans.	Yes
3343	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	Yes
16529	And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	No
11030	My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	No
14986	You have to see it to believe it.	No
15968	The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	No
20283	I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	No
17087	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	No
23426	That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	No
15809	I agree with the Governor on athletics.	No
14711	More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	Yes
19985	I think the government can do better.	No
3874	And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	No
38991	In my view, Syria is still a nation of people where 30,000 non-combatants have perished, but Assad remains in power.	Yes
39199	The highest level of private home ownership is allowed, but I'll make a specific promise.	Yes
22100	Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	Yes
30202	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	No
38594	One of the primary reasons I opposed it was due to that.	Yes
33739	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	No
34983	My commitment was to ensure the safety of women who consume the drug.	Yes
34711	Over the past few years, I have been leading a project that has resulted in reducing government personnel by over 300,000.	Yes
825	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	No
32903	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	No
38286	The plan proposed by my worthy opponent to increase government size is in stark contrast to mine.	Yes
17700	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	No
33484	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	No
6020	Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	Yes
111	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	No
19345	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	No
25074	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	No
5495	And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	No
27481	And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	No
12984	America is not standing still.	No
27709	In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	Yes
35015	Among the five George Bush budgets, Senator McCain cast his vote for four.	Yes
24080	We have spent $4 trillion worth.	Yes
4213	I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	No
1035	Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	No
39202	America is the only nation in the world with a debt of four trillion dollars, and we would have to finance 70% or less of it within five years.	Yes
36390	It's not the right time to separate from a country that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on track to double them in the future, while also facing significant danger from terrorist groups within its own territory, as I previously mentioned, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	Yes
36286	We were informed of the danger to our embassy, and we could have either strengthened our security or removed our personnel before the kidnapping and takeover.	Yes
25909	He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	No
37984	Mr. Noriega was being managed by seven administrations.	Yes
4231	We want to work with the Russians.	No
36279	The recession and the attack on our property resulted in the loss of 1 million jobs.	Yes
8419	I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	No
37445	According to the president, it is permissible for young people to withdraw money from Social Security and deposit it in their own savings account.	Yes
17094	Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	No
505	Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.	Yes
39381	For this reason, I recommended a hydrogen-powered automobile, which is produced using hydrogen.	Yes
12895	If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	No
34509	Despite this, she has been dishonest about many things.	Yes
32974	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	No
22156	And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	No
8018	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	No
6974	It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	No
38975	The average growth rate over the past eight years has been around two and a half percent.	Yes
12066	But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	No
30073	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	No
3982	And I know how to work with them.	No
3856	You talk about the surge.	No
32584	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	No
37349	The amount they have allocated is roughly $200 million, but they only spent $3 million to start it off.	Yes
620	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	No
13493	If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	No
11289	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	No
4173	We do that all the time.	No
18495	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	No
10129	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	No
16577	And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	No
25011	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	No
6583	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	Yes
16569	I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	Yes
14066	All these things take a few minutes.	No
25709	I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	No
7787	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	No
38253	A bill was created for those who work in stores or companies with a million-dollar annual revenue, charging twenty-five cents per hour.	Yes
3714	I know how to do that.	No
37512	The gun crisis is the leading cause of death among young African-American men, resulting in more deaths than the other nine causes combined.	Yes
13382	And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	Yes
39325	His chances of being out of work are roughly four times higher than those of the white baby in his lifetime.	Yes
18078	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	No
20089	I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	No
19816	So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	No
20341	Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	Yes
10234	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	Yes
38098	I managed one of the biggest district attorney's offices in America, which was among the top ten.	Yes
20798	Take for example the marriage penalty.	No
34967	He was able to override one of his bills, which received only one vote in the Senate and seven votes in both houses from Republicans.	Yes
478	I respect his right to disagree with me.	No
3887	And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	No
8360	Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	No
8827	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	Yes
39207	Over the past few years, we have endeavored to raise the minimum wage.	Yes
39187	Our disagreement is a national law that we are waiting for, and the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is from both parties, has my support but the governor's opposition.	Yes
18929	I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.	No
37392	The Sandinistas, following Castro's example in Cuba, removed the other parties from the revolution.	Yes
34849	We allocated 223 to the top 1%, which is significantly higher than the 445 billion we spent.	Yes
20053	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	No
38551	The idea of quotas has never crossed my mind.	Yes
20409	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	No
35343	Our country has 11 million individuals who lack proper documentation.	Yes
28054	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	Yes
7828	Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	No
9742	And I think that's a mistake.	No
16245	So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	No
25117	We were there for the better part of a year.	No
35194	The reason why our taxes are so high is largely due to the fact that they are almost the highest in the world.	Yes
1982	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	No
37988	After a decade of drift, overseas job relocation, and no support for American workers or businesses, we have started to make some headway.	Yes
32607	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	No
28263	I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	No
37093	The third issue is Pakistan, where Al Qaida and the Taliban have established safe havens in northwest Pakistan. Despite providing them with $10 billion under George Bush and Senator McCain's leadership, they have not been eradicated.	Yes
39313	We had grain credits allocated to Iraq, but there is no proof that those credits were used for weapons.	Yes
28462	Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	Yes
26355	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	No
33632	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	No
3175	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	No
6021	Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	Yes
10324	Government does not create jobs.	No
15776	And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	No
38133	Today, the papers reveal that a four-star general with great reputation could be sentenced to five years in prison for lying to the FBI.	Yes
5986	It's mortgaging our children's future.	No
31890	I apologize to the American people.	No
16479	In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	Yes
39378	Nine million individuals lost their jobs.	Yes
26170	The president has been AWOL for four years.	No
13903	But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	No
18173	And there are a long list of thing.	No
1887	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	No
35062	OPEC's price hike in the first quarter of this year resulted in a severe inflationary pressure.	Yes
38580	In New York, Ahmadinejad is advocating for the elimination of Israel's State and will use it as a platform to promote their cause.	Yes
13212	"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	No
33831	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	Yes
35586	Within a span of eight years, the federal government's contribution to education has been reduced by 30 percent.	Yes
9482	I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	No
37542	They have never endorsed any presidential candidate.	Yes
39353	In the next six years, the President intends to increase spending by 20 percent, while I aim to return 14 percent and distribute the remaining 6 percent to the public.	Yes
35542	The Voice of America appropriations have been reduced by eighty million dollars by the Democratic Congress, which I should emphasize.	Yes
8888	Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	No
9599	That's not what you did in that generation.	No
1186	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	No
30419	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	No
22891	And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	Yes
2416	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	Yes
35592	Banks are hesitant to provide loans and mortgages.	Yes
20405	And here is the simple difference.	No
35703	The amount of money we spend on unemployment benefits has increased by 700 percent compared to eight years ago when the Republicans were in charge of the White House.	Yes
18717	But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	No
2111	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	No
14544	And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	No
24516	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	No
38377	Although our per capita income is similar to that of Germany, we are consuming twice as much energy in terms of housing.	Yes
21417	And what's happened in the meantime?	No
13602	On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	Yes
8390	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	No
39118	They have not accomplished their task.	Yes
36264	The Social Security Trust's rate of return is twice the amount that was previously reported.	Yes
31993	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	No
12763	Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	No
18578	We have to start to spend the money now.	No
22193	We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	No
7018	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	No
3020	And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	No
34944	As a 2008 hopeful, I was under the impression that taking bin Laden's bullet would be an option, but you disagreed and suggested that we should not travel to capture him.	Yes
17804	And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	No
37797	During President Obama's tenure, we have doubled our national debt.	Yes
38394	The action has led to a decline in terrorist attacks on American citizens.	Yes
3268	The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	No
33228	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	Yes
19715	The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	Yes
6909	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	Yes
33090	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	No
34876	Those who cultivate tomatoes pay less for their produce than the can label.	Yes
35132	The number of manufacturing jobs lost has reached 357,000.	Yes
16013	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	No
39159	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has stated that 700,000 jobs will be lost.	Yes
23226	He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	Yes
13713	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	Yes
36360	A person who does not veto a bill that provides investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, and research and development tax credits, like Mr. Bush did.	Yes
33460	They have no idea where they come from.	Yes
19049	And we'll continue to spread freedom.	No
11883	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	No
8507	The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	Yes
4019	This was last August, a year ago.	No
1514	We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	Yes
35874	Our oil imports account for approximately 44 percent.	Yes
24335	I mean, that's been done.	Yes
17490	Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	No
24930	We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.	Yes
26733	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	No
38331	Georgia saw Governor Wallace's record straight win, with 84 percent of the vote and approximately fourteen individuals on the ballot.	Yes
27031	...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	No
7887	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	No
39310	Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as myself, endorsed our health program that grants individuals over the age of sixty-five the right to obtain health insurance at their discretion.	Yes
7010	The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	Yes
21336	And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	No
19178	He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	Yes
38173	The significance of budgets lies in their ability to represent decisions made.	Yes
23489	The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	Yes
10561	This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	No
20969	But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	No
1384	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	Yes
19273	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	No
11890	And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	No
38017	I am being overshadowed by the special interests who are squandering my resources.	Yes
38581	Ahmadinejad and his supporters are discussing the elimination of Israel's State, with no preconditions in place.	Yes
37951	Middle- and moderate-income Americans are hit the hardest, while those with higher incomes tend to be relatively well.	Yes
911	And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	Yes
21183	I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	No
12801	I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	No
24715	And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	No
29851	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	No
26292	The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	Yes
19559	And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	No
11292	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	No
15059	There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	No
23992	Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	Yes
7778	The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	Yes
37387	He introduced or endorsed legislation at that time that exempted children from being sent overseas in the war.	Yes

14067	But that's happening as we sit here today.	No
28848	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	No
12995	He's been in some other country.	No
715	That's-at least that's what I read.	No
25593	That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	No
35027	There has been a 40 percent decline in property crime.	Yes
37794	That has been challenged by Senator Obama.	Yes
13095	But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	No
15126	And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	No
24842	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	Yes
26016	But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	No
35299	Our team has been working on a hybrid system for 65 years, with private and public coverage, and currently 85% of our citizens have health insurance while 15% don't.	Yes
29933	Well, just listen to what you heard.	No
22615	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	No
24260	I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	No
25093	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	No
38312	You made an effort to reduce Medicare by $20 billion.	Yes
35790	He was informed by General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, that he would require several hundred thousand.	Yes
12099	It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	No
1567	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	No
17768	If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	No
3789	I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	Yes
939	I want to keep this expansion going.	No
633	As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	No
37245	The greatest increase in government since the Great Society was under our leadership.	Yes
26079	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	No
26682	There are American jobs that are being lost.	No
35170	We've extended Pell Grants to millions of students, including young women, across the nation.	Yes
13544	Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	No
22610	After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	No
4286	I've got to make this point, Jim.	No
20657	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
27751	We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	No
39200	The Medicare system provides private insurers with subsidies worth $15 billion per year.	Yes
33941	I think it would be a great gesture.	No
6748	And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	Yes
38124	You're only 150, which is roughly $100 million less than the No Child Left Behind Act's intended impact on your education system.	Yes
38708	We were informed in 1983 that a balanced budget would be provided to us.	Yes
8830	Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	No
28398	So I want to do something about that.	No
26828	I promise you the economy is going to get better.	No
16894	There's some question about their morality.	No
38704	One of the most sophisticated patient's bill of rights is being presented to us.	Yes
34569	I am of the opinion that the vice president's opposition to the universal health care system in my state is a foolish move.	Yes
32549	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	Yes
705	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	Yes
36996	The Congress accepted a significant package of quality-of-life improvements, which I also presented.	Yes
37085	In my office, I had a conversation with one of the top former Naval operations chiefs and discovered that there are only 25,000 Chief Petty Officers in service.	Yes
16546	I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	No
15532	The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	No
34633	The Natl Women's Political Caucus recognized my efforts in promoting women in high-level government positions with one of their Good Guy Awards, and I've appointed more minorities to these positions than any other governor in my state' history.	Yes
17039	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	No
19409	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	No
29832	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	Yes
27386	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	Yes
35124	How many IRS agents would it take to determine the precise tax cut for the middle class, but not all 50 million Americans?	Yes
23917	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	No
21608	I went to a boys' club.	No
38020	You brought a right-wing congressman into the White House to plot my campaign against me for going to Russia in 1969-70, as did more than 50,000 Americans who went along with me.	Yes
13262	For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	No
21227	I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	No
34845	Jim, I'm confused as to why the top 1% of the population receive their tax savings in their first year, while 95% of seniors wait four or five years before receiving any tax benefits.	Yes
12060	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	No
37895	The President requested the Democratic Congress, which had a two-to-one Democratic majority, to grant us the funds and authority to do responsibilities during the special session, but they refused to comply when Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson intervened.	Yes
38584	The President was advised by the Joint Chiefs not to place our troops in that barracks because they were unjustifiable.	Yes
37466	Social Security, which generates an annual surplus of $70 billion, is not widely known.	Yes
36750	I have been advocating for criminal justice reform since the beginning of my campaign.	Yes
35183	Despite the advice of doctors, HMOs and insurance companies are overruled by their recommendations for treatments.	Yes
7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	No
15272	the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	Yes
3574	Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	No
35181	The wisdom was evident to him until the Democrat primary, where Howard Dean's support led him to change his stance.	Yes
38051	A multitude of companies are implementing this measure.	Yes
35146	The middle-class tax cut of 1992 is still awaited by many people.	Yes
2809	And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	No
39141	The WikiLeaks revelation was made public by her, who sent the documents to her friends at banks, Goldman Sachs, and other organizations.	Yes
36692	That was the event that unfolded during my presidency.	Yes
7947	And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	No
21810	So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	No
36685	Their enforcement budget for the Environmental Protection Agency has been reduced by a third.	Yes
38612	The number of bankruptcies has increased - to an extraordinary extent.	Yes
15802	In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	No
37480	The truth is that only a small fraction of the wealthiest individuals in this country receive 25 percent of their tax deductions, while more than half of all tax credits are given to the 14 percent.	Yes
35388	Keep in mind that the Federal deficit has decreased by $70 billion in a single year since 1987.	Yes
2945	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	Yes
23593	I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	No
27440	So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	Yes
25168	"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	No
24409	But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	No
37748	We've made sure that all of them are eligible for a tax reduction.	Yes
25071	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	Yes
682	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.	No
37877	Our nation's energy policy has not been firmly established under the current administration.	Yes
20023	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	No
36648	She made a lot of money by using the power of her office.	Yes
38053	Lastly, we are against the possibility of military intervention in that area.	Yes
21700	We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	No
38152	Our efforts as secretary of state resulted in a 30 percent rise in American exports to the world.	Yes
2532	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	No
29309	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	Yes
2294	This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	No
23716	And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	No
19783	That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	No
28085	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	No
25417	Now, why do I support the freeze?	No
27786	But this can't keep on going.	No
22712	He came to see me.	No
37403	In spite of our endeavors to limit the use of arms, they have managed to achieve the largest military buildup ever seen in human history.	Yes
8021	Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	No
33705	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	Yes
12222	The horse is up here now.	No
14325	We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	Yes
9662	That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	No
28461	We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	No
20230	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	Yes
9067	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	No
28302	Look, we're in an information age.	No
16731	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	No
17651	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	Yes
22706	"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	No
25857	But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	No
38781	Most of the tax reduction was given to the country's wealthiest individuals.	Yes
23231	One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	Yes
39044	You discovered $4 trillion of options to attain a more balanced budget, but we still encounter deficits that amount to trillions of dollars annually.	Yes
36585	Observe the 24 retired generals and admirals who have shown their support for me, such as the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
4305	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	No
36375	The manufacturing industry suffered a great deal when your husband signed NAFTA.	Yes
20831	Here are the key ingredients.	No
36974	Despite having an enormous number of nuclear warheads, the country is currently in a very difficult situation.	Yes
29110	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	No
1968	When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	Yes
35188	Over the past four years, there has been an 85 percent increase in trade deals or exports to Japan, and a decrease in our trade deficit with Japan.	Yes
17365	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	No
35983	My attention is solely on the fact that we are still avoiding the Glaspie papers.	Yes
26092	$500 per child under 18.	Yes
35757	Our yearly investment of $300 billion was used to protect the world.	Yes
36200	He asserted that he was unfairly favored in the Republican primary.	Yes
1665	And housing has begun to rise.	Yes
18699	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	Yes
9730	And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	Yes
37615	Under Hillary Clinton's plan, taxes will be raised in a huge way.	Yes
39278	I have applied the same approach to women's appointment and Spanish-speaking Americans.	Yes
37761	In the inner cities, poverty accounts for 45 percent of the population.	Yes
37527	Our uniform presently has 17,000 men and women who are receiving food stamps.	Yes
15555	And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	No
7834	But I do not expect it to come.	No
17885	The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	No
6092	It is not and I just described it...	No
4021	And this was August, a year ago.	No
36450	I am against the idea of registering firearms at a national level.	Yes
7872	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	No
35102	The average food package per person is five cents per day.	Yes
38141	That was my opponent.	Yes
22002	But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	No
36272	The only way to see the disparity is to look at Michigan and Ohio, where numerous jobs and businesses are leaving.	Yes
38846	That has the potential to safeguard 3 million families and 700,000 children.	Yes
26643	people get so tired of politics.	No
25557	Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	No
21151	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	No
8852	But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	No
17304	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	No
8725	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	Yes
33554	We are spending a fortune doing it.	No
12401	And I'm going to try to do better.	No
35476	The program was utilized by approximately fourteen to fifteen thousand people.	Yes
34525	Our generosity is the most significant among all donors, especially those who are in a state of suffering.	Yes
39268	The vote for the admission of Red China was carried out by only two African nations, Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	Yes
14895	In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	Yes
38372	Throughout my time in Congress, I have been fighting against proliferation and proliferation.	Yes
3068	These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	No
16659	We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	No
37216	Fisher House was the recipient of the money that was invested in building homes for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
35710	You've created a Strategic Defense Initiative, launched an agency, and are testing it, discussing deployment, with earmarks of around $30 billion.	Yes
34948	A report released by two former defense secretaries last week, including Mr. Carlucci, has suggested that a total of 100,000 troops or slightly less would be adequate.	Yes
1315	I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	No
2280	I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	No
33322	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	No
38648	Secretary Clinton's visits to New England, Ohio, and Pennsylvania will result in destruction with a manufacturing decline of up to 40 percent.	Yes
28793	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	No
34890	It is worth mentioning that there are 33,000 fatalities caused by guns each year, in hindsight.	Yes
7958	I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	No
21784	So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	No
19125	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	No
36756	Obama's administration has resulted in the departure of millions of people from this country.	Yes
38892	Despite his desire to enforce the death penalty on drug traffickers, the vice president's administration maintains a federal furlough program that is among the most permissive in the country. Last year, approximately 7,000 people were furled by the government, including drug dealers and drug pushers, whom he now wants to put to death.	Yes
35726	North Korea presently has between four and seven nuclear weapons at its disposal.	Yes
1679	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	No
12530	I think there're several reasons.	No
38834	By defending a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD, I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion.	Yes
22644	He's trying to attack me.	No
12725	I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	No
17483	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	No
10020	I know these folks and I know their families.	No
35502	The 28 nations of NATO agreed to join us in battling terrorism after 9/11, and they are still supporting us.	Yes
8610	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	No
23246	After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	Yes
37740	Our Administration has halted them at Quemoy and Matsu, Indochina, Lebanon, and other locations worldwide.	Yes
21901	If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	No
33305	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	No
2507	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	No
4007	Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	Yes
1666	But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.	No
14247	I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	No
2506	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	No
17208	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	No
16238	We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	No
35755	During my time as secretary of state, I was actively involved in the removal of Al Qaida leadership, which included bin Laden's elimination.	Yes
14877	Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	No
25790	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	No
11239	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	No
11762	So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	No
14626	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	No
13273	It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	No
5564	You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	No
7503	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	No
622	But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	No
37538	Our Embassies were subjected to demolition attacks by a truck on three separate occasions, one after the other.	Yes
35081	Approximately six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars was appropriated by the Congress of the United States, more than what the President had proposed to be spent up until a week ago.	Yes

32681	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	Yes
17210	I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	No

38521	The economy is deemed unfavorable by 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates who have examined it.	Yes
38340	The payroll tax on Social Security earnings amounts to roughly $38,000 today.	Yes

15450	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	No
8111	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	No
39428	You've been doing it for 30 years, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	Yes
36959	It is my opinion that we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government and reconsider lifting the arms embargo on Bosnians, as they are not capable of facing a fair fight against armed opponents who are bent on ethnic cleansing.	Yes
21315	If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	No
7592	And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	Yes
17521	I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	No
30197	I have a winning temperament.	No
17966	And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	No
32752	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	No
35753	During the same period when my tax plan had reduced taxes for 98 percent of families, I also reduced small businesses 18 times.	Yes
15381	Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	No

39229	A fine of $850,000 was imposed on him on a woman.	Yes
28251	Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	Yes
24503	And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	No

17484	Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	No
37725	His plan's net tax increase amounts to 60-80 billion dollars.	Yes
15666	And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	No
20143	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	No
34945	You were a candidate in 2008, and while I had said that I would take the shot if bin Laden was in our sights, you advised against moving forward to capture one person.	Yes

19683	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	Yes
21740	So why pass a law that won't fix it?	No
34445	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	No
33191	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	No
39389	Despite this, I am more troubled by the fact that on the day following the assassination of the US ambassador, which was the first time since 1979, the president traveled to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser and then went to Colorado for another political event.	Yes
27705	And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	Yes
26530	A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	No
33105	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	No
6174	You were offered a chance to join.	No
19376	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	No

39482	It is crucial to avoid banning individuals based on their religious beliefs, as Donald has stated.	Yes
36929	Up to this point, 700,000 jobs have been lost in the United States.	Yes
8744	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	No
38745	Crime has decreased in communities where police officers are stationed near schools where children carry weapons, resulting in safer and more secure environments.	Yes
2246	That's -- that's a big topic.	No
34480	Although hitting base camps is a common practice, the president's observation of Muammar Khadaffi'S state-sponsored fingerprints on American deaths led him to target Libya.	Yes
24768	So we don't have the best.	No
22948	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	No
8465	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	Yes
7597	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	No

9573	"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	No
6240	"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	No
8351	All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	No
23899	I think the American people should be the judge of that.	No
15516	He had two terms in the Congress.	No
3132	Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	Yes
14234	You've got to go to the people.	No
19528	But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	Yes
33221	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	Yes
39027	Mr. Nixon has stated that he also supports the Eisenhower policy, which is not controversial.	Yes
14954	We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	No
15754	And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	No
26116	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	No
854	But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	No
36655	Our workforce is the most productive in the industrialized world, but we are also losing out on significant trade deficits and salaries, leaving us behind only nine other countries.	Yes

37995	She was said to be lacking in stamina by me.	Yes
22809	"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	No
6880	Once again, the president is misleading America.	No
29343	I wrote about that in my book...	No
356	But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	No
37305	I desire the cap on the outrageous accusations, as it comes with an annual cost of $20-25 billion.	Yes
14847	In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	Yes
34420	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	No
27214	So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	No
26419	We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	Yes
38614	The public schools in my state receive 75% of their budget, and Time magazine recognized our schools as the only states with significant progress in education during the 1980s.	Yes
26103	And the government doesn't create jobs.	No
27887	The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	No

34463	During the second debate, I proposed taking a break and traveling to Washington to meet with you on the way to the enterprise zones because both parties want these areas.	Yes
19342	That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	Yes
2762	I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	No
39197	The farmer who cultivates wheat earns approximately two and a half cents for every twenty-five cent loaf of bread.	Yes
38709	The year 1983 saw us being assured of a budget that was balanced.	Yes
16328	Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	No
20347	Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	No
37769	After analyzing my proposal and Donald's proposal, independent experts have concluded that the implementation of his tax plan would result in the loss or recession of 3.5 million jobs and potentially cause another recession due to the debt being over $5 trillion and the middle class being more affected than the wealthy.	Yes
32971	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	No
36034	The only way to achieve a tax cut is by reducing the tax increase, as the Administration has left us with an implicit $86 billion tax hike next year.	Yes
2202	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	Yes
24137	But it is a good program.	No
3076	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	Yes
5897	It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	No
7435	But Washington is a tough town.	No
14859	In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	No

38157	It was not voted on in the House of Representatives.	Yes

13769	And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	Yes
5494	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	No

19372	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	Yes
38540	He noted that space developments are often compared to scientific productivity and progress in many of these countries.	Yes
39033	Seventy-five percent of his citizens have been held accountable.	Yes
12257	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	No
33783	But I think it's really an important issue.	No
36425	The $550 billion tax plan that Senator Dole and his supporters are putting into practice is not sustainable without the help of cutting Medicare and Social Security, as per his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato.	Yes
19428	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	Yes
17432	The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.	Yes
10185	We're starting to see gains in math and science.	Yes
6635	This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	Yes
7971	And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	No
35357	I was against the war.	Yes
1543	As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	No
35688	Our debt of $4 trillion is the highest in the world, and only America would have $2.8 trillion or 70% of it financed in 5 years or less.	Yes
15298	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	No
26465	Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	No
8806	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	Yes
8484	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	No
16901	Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	No
17371	I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	No
7934	I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	No
235	Well, we're on the right track.	No
354	A lot of them are mentally sick.	No
8173	The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	No
24633	Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	No
8805	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	Yes
17911	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	No
19645	Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	No
36612	The oil reserves in the wells have grown larger than the amount of oil extracted in 121 years.	Yes
37777	We have significantly strengthened border control and enforcement.	Yes

26575	I would be willing to have another debate this year.	No
4107	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	No
16168	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	No
25588	A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	No
10906	You know who voted against it?	No
11008	Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	No
38262	He was left with the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
728	I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	No
32464	Well, why didn't she change it?	No
9026	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	No
9080	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	No
36123	This was prevented by the Vice President's decisive vote in the Senate to block federal aid for teacher salaries.	Yes
38731	The rise in co-payments, costs, and expenses leads to a decrease in the affordability of health insurance for Americans.	Yes
15285	There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	Yes
38639	The reason we doubled the fuel efficiency of cars is because of this.	Yes
33094	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	No
18417	And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	Yes
21844	And my program is this.	No
25045	A President must know those things.	No
30301	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	No
35051	You will not receive $150 billion in tax payments for those who spend more than $200,000.	Yes
13364	I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	No
28829	And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	Yes
14306	We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	No
36229	Health care accounts for one-fifth of our gross national product.	Yes
6492	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	No
13186	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	No
6311	Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	Yes
18901	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	No
13488	The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	No
28697	And so I don't support censorship.	No
12822	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	No
32611	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	No
38281	The tax reform of 1981 provided $60,000 in tax relief for individuals earning $200 per year for 3 years, while those earning $30,000 peryear did not receive any relief or had their taxes increased.	Yes
8216	And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	No
16558	There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	No
6831	It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	No
36779	They are being granted a vast amount of money and everything.	Yes
4141	He did not say that.	No
20348	Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	Yes
36759	A total of 84 new mental health treatment centers were established by us.	Yes

17532	Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.	Yes
25803	Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	Yes
13497	We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	No
23825	The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	No
36927	Americans should feel proud that when Tunisians started protesting, I and my administration stood in solidarity with them more than any other country.	Yes
32746	... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	Yes
36088	160 percent of all cocaine consumption is consumed.	Yes
27363	We need to be thinking about cyber security.	No
7119	And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	No
2644	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	Yes
6732	It's important that we do that.	No
14672	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	No
70	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	No
33357	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	No
14747	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	No
16496	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	No
26065	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	No
33600	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	No
36232	Despite being 90 miles away from our shore, Cuba passed a law that allowed people to sue, but the President delayed the process for six months.	Yes
738	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	No
38091	We are placing Mr. Castro in quarantine for the day.	Yes
37053	President Ford, who was almost 90% of a treaty that we could have agreed with when he left office, is clearly against the SALT treaties, as two Republican presidents attempted to pass them.	Yes
38254	ISIS is currently being fought against by Syria.	Yes
7665	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	No
21223	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	No
38592	During the August session, the aid to education bill was not approved by the House Rules Committee, which included four Republicans and two Democrats.	Yes

35986	The college entrance exams have improved for the first time in approximately 20 years due to these factors.	Yes
32104	Oh, you didn't delete them?	No
26486	That's just one tiny example.	No
3341	One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	Yes
35266	The significance of Pell Grants is undeniable, at 6 billion dollars.	Yes
9509	I want to get America's economy going again.	No
6574	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	Yes
12882	And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	No
8745	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	No
30389	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	No
32483	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	Yes
38408	He has shipped jobs to 12 countries, with Mexico being one of them.	Yes
37842	The vice president should have informed Margaret that I did not raid the pension fund of Massachusetts, which is completely incorrect, as it was not my responsibility.	Yes
32623	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	Yes
16383	We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	No
29847	Look, one murder is too many.	No
36118	There has been a rise in the number of unemployed Americans, with an increase of 500 more than three months ago.	Yes
16811	One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	Yes
15446	Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	No
38496	We have never disclosed them to the Congress, Foreign Relations, or Senate Intelligence Committees.	Yes
29034	I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	No
26562	So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	No
28354	(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	No
34595	It is not my opinion that we should legislate for the goal if there is evidence that it cannot be achieved.	Yes
15101	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	No
12683	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	Yes
13659	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	Yes
30125	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	Yes
36202	It appears that the governor has made several missteps in the last eight years, as if they have not been followed through on any of my previous commitments.	Yes
25435	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	No
23994	That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	No
11520	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	No
38748	Nevertheless, let's be unambiguous: The budget of the previous year came to $18 billion in earmarks.	Yes
27160	I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	No
3307	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	No
13023	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	No
37920	The fact that 5 and a half million people cast their votes for me is the difference between what I am being told.	Yes
38236	As per your observation, inflation stood at 4.8% when Mr. Carter became President.	Yes
17397	All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	Yes
10381	Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	No
21899	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	No
38351	I declared my intention to curb Wall Street's excesses, and we implemented the most severe reforms on Wall street since the 1930s.	Yes
34559	We shipped approximately $1 billion worth of arms overseas during the Republican Party's time in office, but now we have a cumulative total of 10 to 12 billion dollars for countries that frequently use these weapons to engage in warfare.	Yes
1460	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	No
37241	Our defense is not strengthened by the fact that we have a surplus of warheads, which has now been pointed at us with over 2,000 more than when he was first sworn in.	Yes
18104	The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.	Yes
11251	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	No
37030	If you have a health care plan that you feel is suitable, you can choose to keep it.	Yes
37851	Perhaps, it's worth considering in a democracy like Russia.	Yes
26779	It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	No
34247	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	Yes
36935	The addition of 50 tons of TNT in railroad cars would result in a carload of the material, which would be spread out throughout America.	Yes
10669	My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
37473	My intention is to reach out to those individuals.	Yes
9147	And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	No
39351	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	Yes
6994	I will not privatize it.	No
25015	That is where I think the future of the world lies.	No
37681	Only one prosecution has taken place under the Brady Bill, with only one being related to the assault weapon ban and only seven under it.	Yes
23894	So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	No
22720	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	No
35783	In the meantime, North Korea has acquired nuclear weapons.	Yes
32183	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	No
39224	You can choose from a variety of options, including the Iran deal you love, which resulted in their $150 billion refund, or anything else.	Yes
13809	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	Yes
26309	He won't tell you because he can't.	No
37442	You alleged that the negotiation you left behind was a walk in the woods between one of your representatives and the Soviet Union, which the latter rejected.	Yes
25780	Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	No
39004	The total debt of our country is $20 trillion.	Yes
37918	The reason we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the previous administration is due to this reason.	Yes
16766	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	No
37062	The United States of America currently pays 35 percent of the world's second-highest business taxes.	Yes
14496	You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	No
22049	They just write a note for the interest.	No
22860	I fully understand the threat.	No
37965	Same goes for highways.	Yes
3184	But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	No
36476	The public schools that serve 90% of our children require improvement in their standards and progress through programs like those outlined in this campaign.	Yes
28879	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	No
2191	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	Yes
39297	According to multiple reports, the Russians have expressed their disbelief in allowing us to do this.	Yes
15413	First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	No
37583	The promised economies in Government have not been delivered and the 4% inflation rate that Mr. Carter's first term saw is no longer on the table.	Yes
1034	I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	No
30309	Words matter when you run for president.	No
24542	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	No
8340	Now, I can only say this.	No
10936	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	No
23886	Well, they've got a point.	No
19658	And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	Yes
12926	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	Yes
34926	The economy is still experiencing a slowdown in growth.	Yes
18148	Can I respond to that?	No
34409	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	No
36580	The housing market has been negatively impacted by Dodd-Frank's failure to predict the implementation of regulations.	Yes
14840	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	No
8970	Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	No
38061	Our approach not only involved repairing Medicare and planning for the future, but also managed to balance the budget in an unacknowledged way.	Yes
9583	And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	No
14850	There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	No
38108	We sent welfare reform to the president on two occasions, but he rejected it after three attempts.	Yes
35060	This Administration has accomplished four times the number of projects completed compared to the previous administration.	Yes
9736	You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	No
746	We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	No
38095	In your opinion, is it acceptable for the youth to have unemployment of up to 50% and 8 million Americans without work?	Yes
34909	In a curious twist, Senator Johnson was one of those who opposed that viewpoint, voting with the seventy to the twelve.	Yes
28807	The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	No
2175	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	No
13930	Let's think it through here.	No
25298	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	No
8545	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	No
34433	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	No
21684	And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	No
38463	Our strategy involves coordinating efforts across the international community to demand Assad's departure.	Yes
3915	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
34907	As Governor of California, I was in charge of enforcing the most stringent air pollution regulations in the country, which is the strictest air quality law that has been implemented to date.	Yes
34064	This is -- this is a mindset.	No
34737	It is a fact that in the debate over the Formosa resolution, he forgot to vote against or against an amendment, and on this particular topic.	Yes
37915	Despite this, let's examine the aid we have provided to Poland, which has been primarily aimed at economic assistance to its citizens.	Yes
14082	And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	No
36859	The information that was disclosed today after the Mayaguez incident was already in his possession.	Yes
39315	Despite being close, Senator Kennedy had to delay the passage for 100 days because he was not satisfied with one provision.	Yes
34939	Hearing about Central America and our process was intriguing, and I wished to find agreement with Mr. Mondale instead of debating because his strategy, which includes diplomatic processes across Central American countries and close collaboration with the Contadora group, is what we have been following for years.	Yes
24208	It is the number one culprit.	No
26482	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	No
8156	I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	No
36575	This man was expelled from Kuwait by us.	Yes
36942	The military dictatorship in Chile was the recipient of 85 percent of the Food for Peace grants given to South America under Mr. Ford's leadership last year.	Yes
37213	Four million new jobs have been added to our workforce since the recession began.	Yes
21653	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	No
12928	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	Yes
36818	The unemployment rate in downtown urban ghetto areas is extremely high, with the majority of people falling into the 50s and 60s, particularly those who are very poor and belonging to minority groups.	Yes
38034	Mr. President, I don't want to identify as a liberal, but your record in Arkansas is the most significant tax increase ever recorded.	Yes
6315	And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	No
12198	That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	Yes
7858	The question is what we're going to do in the future.	No
27589	Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	No
35637	A yearly income of less than $250,000, or less that amounts to 25 years' worth of earnings, will not result in a tax increase of one dime.	Yes
21812	So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	No
35074	At present, we spend approximately $300 billion annually on defense, while the Japanese and Germans respectively spend around 30 billion in Asia and Europe.	Yes
38590	I supported a law that would prohibit drive-by deliveries and allow insurance companies to remove patients from hospitals within 24 hours. Additionally, I opposed Senator Dole's Medicare plan, which would have forced many older adults into managed care and caused Medicare to decline financially.	Yes
663	And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	No
35973	It is common knowledge that the home prices of retired individuals are decreasing and those who cannot afford their mortgages are losing their financial stability.	Yes
9137	And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	No
36454	After 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I established a commission to investigate and fix the incident.	Yes
36106	Figures from September 1980 suggest that there may be a shortage of approximately 104,000 individuals in the ranks between E-4 and E-9, as I have seen.	Yes
23890	I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	No
13908	Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	No
21394	So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	No
12833	Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	No
36434	The absence of leadership in Mr. Ford has been criticized by the Republican party, as has the foreign policy of this administration.	Yes
22144	Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	No
36320	He is currently troubled by the current deficits, despite his belief that an increase in the deficit would lead to economic growth and lower unemployment rates, which was previously estimated at $52 billion.	Yes
26062	You got two years to look for a job.	No
20539	I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	No
34498	Every farmer is aware that net farm income has decreased by 50 percent in the last 3 years.	Yes
25602	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	No
36113	It's important to differentiate between your priorities that are effective and those that have been imposed by lobbyists and special interest groups in Washington.	Yes
18237	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	No
37464	A study from just a few weeks ago proposed that the north polar ice cap will be completely lost during summertime in 50 years.	Yes
22246	Now, you're paying for that.	No
15574	He's broken it three times in the past year already.	Yes
782	Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	No
23243	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	Yes
35638	The combination of $150 billion in interest alone, 25 percent of high school dropouts, homeless individuals, and a third of veterans living on the streets without money make it impossible for us to be satisfied.	Yes
26161	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	No
34476	The Secretary of Defense, who is the president's secretary, referred to it as devastating, and I haven't used that term.	Yes
21032	It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	Yes
35788	A healthy forest bill was passed, and we believe it is essential to work towards protecting our forests, especially in Western states.	Yes
32167	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	No
6571	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	No
18823	And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	No
27366	It's not driven by politics.	Yes
19445	But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	No
14468	The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	Yes
36544	No one has ever been endorsed on immigration by them before.	Yes
15530	But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	No
33064	We've got to remain energy-independent.	No
3651	I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	Yes
13174	He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	Yes
718	I'm not reconsidering my position.	No
35176	Our industrial state's low murder rate is one of the reasons why.	Yes
38189	Our investment in the areas you have asked is much lower than that of our major rivals, leading to a decrease in our wealth.	Yes
3960	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	Yes
36179	During this time, we contributed $5.7 billion in tax rebates, tax credits, and tax cuts to the California residents.	Yes
11861	I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	No
27296	... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	No
20728	This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	No
36221	It's a tragedy that our youth is still using marijuana to increase their drug use, reaching approximately 11 percent.	Yes
35627	No American diplomatic representative is present in any of the six.	Yes
27269	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	No
10095	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	No
34937	Her donors, including all of them, are in high demand.	Yes
28521	I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	No
18843	But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	No
30446	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	No
12816	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	No
23304	You looked at me like my clock was up.	No
10800	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	Yes
16064	And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	No
9761	We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	Yes
20994	I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	No
12877	But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	No
1209	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	No
18009	This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	No
11083	This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	No
13168	We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	No
25270	This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	No
10523	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	Yes
35089	The group of people who experienced a rise in their income and tax payments during the 1980s are those who were affected.	Yes
15533	And he could do the job.	No
6561	But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	No
11858	So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	No
2616	This seems to be a trend.	No
8245	I know what it means to be poor.	No
38971	Our government lacks the ability to prevent the devaluation of their currency.	Yes
7133	And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	No
13678	Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.	Yes
36760	The success of Mayor Giuliani's stop and frisk strategy in Chicago was mirrored in New York.	Yes
11729	It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	No
17588	Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	Yes
6717	That's not what we want.	No
3224	On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	Yes
20306	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	No
38669	The interest rates have decreased by approximately 9 or 10 points and must likely decrease even more.	Yes
20162	And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	Yes
30441	Well, I support our democracy.	No
22553	Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	No
37812	Shortly after the election, a proposal was made to decrease Social Security benefits by 25 percent, which would reduce inflation adjustment, eliminate minimum benefits for the poorest on Social security, and remove educational benefits from dependents.	Yes
26661	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	No
6897	It's not a government plan.	No
13719	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	No
186	But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	No
35136	The state of Texas has ranked 50th out of 50 in health care coverage for its citizens under Governor Bush's administration.	Yes
37643	Our entry into war was jeopardized by the involvement of three Democratic presidents.	Yes
1808	So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	No
7645	And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	No
31955	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	Yes
17377	Well, again, I'm running on the record.	No
36807	The 4 years to the present report have seen a rise of almost $3,000 in personal earnings per capita after taxes.	Yes
15240	I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	No
1816	I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	No
18691	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	No
37167	It's commendable that you backed us in our efforts to organize a coalition with Libya, as the governor acknowledged.	Yes
22080	Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	No
35928	A computer located in Washington, D.C. has 20 million names of people who are opposed to owning guns.	Yes
28709	And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	No
29250	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	Yes
24054	But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	Yes
37423	My assumption is that when Gallup conducted their first poll in December of 1975, my name wasn't included on the list.	Yes
26168	I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	No
34955	At least some farmers are benefiting from the agricultural credit bill passed by Congress.	Yes
39095	Because of all the ridiculous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year, doctors are now practicing defensive medicine.	Yes
36017	Six Democrats were able to change their votes after his maneuver, but we lost by one vote.	Yes
38056	The president has made it clear that he will not interfere with Social Security and we haven't targeted the recipient.	Yes
35417	Before I took office, this government had a policy of bilateral talks with North Korea.	Yes
19284	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	No
20083	We just see the world in different ways.	No
34608	He acknowledges that the administration has been conducting business with Noriega.	Yes
35308	The growth rate is slower this year compared to last year, and even more so than the previous year.	Yes
7985	Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	No
11993	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	No
34749	When it came to ensuring Gadhafi's departure from power and eventual capture, your assessment as Governor was that this situation was a clear case of mission creep and muddle.	Yes
27450	It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	Yes
26589	And people have to decide.	No
12757	And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	No
38898	Governor Romney's economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut in addition to the extension of the Bush tax cuts, which would result in an additional $2 trillion in military spending that hasn't been requested.	Yes
16800	And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	Yes
36148	It is highly unjustifiable for someone to cross the border and become a citizen under her plan, which allows for open borders.	Yes
34996	The number of jobs created has increased by ten times since the Republican Party took office, with an overall increase of fewer than 100,000 jobs.	Yes
34843	Our latest challenge is to regain control of Mosul.	Yes
29771	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	No
24849	And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	No
39380	The reason I suggested was a hydrogen-powered automobile, which is produced using hydrogen as fuel.	Yes
8225	Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	No
36975	The country is in a very difficult situation because of the large number of nuclear warheads, which has reached 1,800, but we didn't have that many.	Yes
26458	I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	No
21816	I think you have to take on medical fraud.	No
34844	I'm confused, Jim. Why do we get our tax cuts first year to the wealthiest 1% and then have to wait four or five years for seniors to receive their final penny?	Yes
11489	Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	No
25884	He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	Yes
37437	By granting statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, we can achieve significant progress in this area, as approximately 25% of jobs are held by and assigned solely by individuals who hold government contracts.	Yes
19870	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	No
25227	A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	No
21406	But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	Yes
38724	The signing of immigration reform was also endorsed by George W. Bush.	Yes
32600	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	No
33787	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	Yes
36323	Our desire to control the spread of nuclear weapons has led to the alienation of our closest trade allies in countries like Libya or Iraq, where terrorists are at risk.	Yes
34547	In July, the president was given a national intelligence assessment that predicted civil war in the best-case scenario and more like today's situation.	Yes
30430	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	No
22772	I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	No
34610	The Central Accounting has been in place for us.	Yes
28735	I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	No
38041	He not only advocates for the termination of the treaty, despite the fact that many of his quotes are against its final form, but also acknowledges the possibility of playing a trump card in the Soviet Union's nuclear arms race and insisting on our nation'S nuclear superiority as if it were negotiating with them.	Yes
35969	This year, 50% of college graduates are graduating without a college degree, and they may be jobless.	Yes
35879	It is widely known that I was against air pollution laws in California, but the President must be suggesting a law that the Federal Government attempted to enforce.	Yes
20415	I think that is the wrong choice.	No
38624	In my middle-income tax cut, I urged Congress to increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars each.	Yes
11493	The sanctions are being violated.	Yes
13292	Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	No
3178	Under this administration that strength has not been realized.	No
19979	You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.	No
7850	If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.	No
20961	It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	No
24920	That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	No
18217	We didn't need that tax cut.	No
19099	Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	No
36525	The South African government is seen as working alongside its oppressive regime, according to the Nobel laureate's statement two days ago.	Yes
12975	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	No
36982	Hillary Clinton's opposition to Assad has resulted in her being more forceful and clever than she or Obama.	Yes
34338	So we have to use our great people.	No
38112	According to a major news magazine, my state has achieved the highest job growth in the country this year, as well as fourth place for income growth, fourthplace for poverty reduction, and thirdplace ranking in overall economic performance.	Yes
33989	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	Yes
39299	Many NATO countries are not fulfilling their obligations, with the 28 nations being the primary contributors.	Yes
19292	We worked too hard to lower it.	No
26936	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	No
38527	This is the reason why the Congress, even the Republicans, have not backed the President's proposals.	Yes
19253	Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	No
37826	He has never endorsed any of the arms control agreements, including the limited test ban, SALT I, and the Vladivostok Treaty with President Ford. Instead, he wants to introduce a nuclear weapons control agreement that was negotiated by myself and my two Republican predecessors over ten years.	Yes
26662	I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	Yes
26351	This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	No
39117	The combination of these factors has led to our oil imports being the lowest in 16 years.	Yes
36225	The second quarter saw a Consumer Price Index of roughly 12%, as we were instead experiencing.	Yes
37581	Both the HMOs and insurance companies are in favor of the Republican majority bill, which is currently pending.	Yes
22029	Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	No
38553	At the time of the treaty's approval in fifty-five, they were not part of that area.	Yes
19889	If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	No
27892	They would have gone through a...	No
37453	In case the Javits-Nixon or Nixon-Javitson program was fully utilized, it would have cost the government and state approximately six hundred million dollars annually.	Yes
28186	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	No
355	And we've got to attend to them.	No
26949	We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	No
6940	Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	No
35418	We have the highest job growth rate in the country, as well as the lowest spending at both state and local levels, and the second lowest tax burden.	Yes
38618	The first president to lose their jobs in 72 years.	Yes
37417	My recent signing of a law has strengthened our capacity to handle the terrorist issue alongside our allies.	Yes
1399	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	No
37452	The government and state would have had to pay approximately six hundred million dollars and six sute thousand dollars per year for the Javits-Nixon or Nixon-Javitses program if they were fully utilized.	Yes
17744	[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	No
32116	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	No
13461	And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	No
3156	Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	Yes
28038	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	No
35722	The last budget he managed saw a decrease in student loans and Pell Grants.	Yes
39406	The campaign for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts saw Hillary Clinton leading an effort.	Yes
36542	Out of the 17 banned assault weapons, only six have been banned since the ban was reinstated, with eleven having been modified and reintroduced to public streets.	Yes
27438	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	No
35279	He has never expressed regret for his comments about African-Americans, Latinos and Muslims, POWs or immigrants, or those with disabilities.	Yes
13972	Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	Yes
38259	My track record of working with both Republicans and Democrats is admirable, which is what our country requires.	Yes
21397	We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	No
23056	"""I think that makes sense."	No
37058	Mr. Mondale should be aware that the president of the United States did not instruct the marines to enter the barracks.	Yes
34848	The top 1% receives 223 of the new spending, which is significantly higher than the current 445 billion.	Yes
8720	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	No
20711	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	No
10032	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	Yes
38667	Our decision to use an English company for distributing around half of the flu vaccines for the American citizen was made, but unfortunately, the vaccine they were producing was found to be contaminated.	Yes
22047	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	No
19272	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	Yes
35362	I am the only governor who has been elected for four consecutive years.	Yes
19137	That, to me, is the key.	No
10728	You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	No
23347	And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	No
24632	We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	No
24910	And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	Yes
23483	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	No
38066	After her client offended him, she was seen laughing at the girl who had been raped twice.	Yes
36464	I mentioned in my health care bill that insurance companies must offer contraceptive coverage to all those who are covered by it.	Yes
26342	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	No
35531	This was the most significant expansion of private insurance.	Yes
32109	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	Yes
36392	Therefore, I have never proposed that we should be able to pay off the debt in significant amounts or at all within nineteen years.	Yes
22747	Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	No
1593	The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	Yes
10569	But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	No
20027	And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	No
10832	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	Yes
17042	I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	No
16794	Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	Yes
1026	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	No
37840	"""Deadly Gambits,"" a book by Strobe Talbott, one of the most esteemed authors in this field, suggests that the President has not yet grasped the necessary concepts to govern and guide us, both in terms of security and arms control."	Yes
25955	You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	No
14863	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	No
26200	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	No
30010	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	No
28960	So this is a show me state.	No
12807	If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	No
35233	Those are the times when our troops will be back home.	Yes
17038	My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	No
19157	We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	Yes
37162	Many of the companies that we have invested in have gone out of business, with approximately half of them also closing down.	Yes
36391	The Taliban and Haqqani Network, which have significant terrorist threats within their country, are not the only ones that should be separated from a nation with 100 nuclear weapons.	Yes
14295	Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	Yes
35577	In the book he wrote, Vice President Gore also called for the imposition of significant energy taxes to improve the environment.	Yes
38121	Export controls on agricultural products were necessary, and I believe that expanding the private sector is a more effective strategy for creating jobs, given that five out of six jobs in our economy are currently in the form of private investment.	Yes
32784	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	No
38750	You have already given them to the oil companies, with all due respect.	Yes
17630	I gave you back some of that time.	No
20125	In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	Yes
36239	I witness a constant presence of 35 million individuals who are not insured.	Yes
27034	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	No
35398	The president made it clear that he would not increase taxes in New Jersey, but Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesperson, stated within a day that the pledge was not guaranteed.	Yes
2445	And there are ways of doing it.	No
10128	But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	No
36789	The economy is currently exhibiting it.	Yes
37181	This administration's overthrow of an elected government and its support in establishing a military dictatorship is reminiscent of many other cases.	Yes
19407	Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	No
2877	Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	No
37033	Despite our assurance to him that we wouldn't intervene in his border dispute, we have kept the papers handed over to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th confidential.	Yes
7940	That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	No
37969	While we've had a temporary pause, most economists, regardless of their political beliefs, argue that it was largely advisable as the previous growth rate of 9.2 percent in the first quarter of this year could not be maintained at all.	Yes
38992	During an interview, Governor Carter stated that he would increase taxes for those with moderate or middle-income status or above.	Yes
16140	That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	No
10160	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	Yes
29852	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	No
36236	I am content to acknowledge that since 1969, during the Republican administration, ten million individuals have been removed from the lower taxpayer end of the taxpayer hierarchy.	Yes
37728	Senator Obama is spending an unprecedented amount of money on negative ads that were used against me, which has never been seen in American politics before.	Yes
19191	For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	Yes
34883	Several weeks ago, the Embassy was destroyed and all necessary measures were not implemented.	Yes
27256	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	Yes
34864	Small businesses make up the majority of our jobs, accounting for two-thirds.	Yes
32460	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	No
29537	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	No
9242	So here's what I've done since I've been president.	No
37718	Women have experienced a decrease of 2.2 percent in their wages.	Yes
6500	I don't really think about him very much.	No
39064	I settled the lawsuit without admitting guilt, even though it was brought against various real estate companies, and it's just one of those cases.	Yes
22269	That's the only way we got him back.	No
36796	The number of new small businesses and jobs created has reached an all-time high.	Yes
17112	Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	Yes
34552	Our average has been at least 7 per cent.	Yes
6960	First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	No
1455	With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.	Yes
34479	The funds we have allocated for recovery are finished, and the addicts are back on their feet.	Yes
34259	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	Yes
15683	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	No
18101	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	No
36594	It has come to our attention that this is one of their preferred methods of creating chaos and collecting information.	Yes
32727	Why can't they do it quietly?	No
3096	The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	Yes
20174	And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	No
2200	Benefits were not affected at all.	Yes
35573	The Brady Bill was met with fierce opposition from Senator Dole.	Yes
970	We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	No
17447	But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	No
35180	He recognized the sense of it, but when the Democrat primary arrived, Howard Dean, who opposed war, gained an advantage, leading him to change his position.	Yes
29805	They've got a lot of concerns.	No
15392	I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	No
5839	And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	No
35426	He has repeatedly stated that he was unconcerned about other nations obtaining nuclear weapons, including Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.	Yes
83	And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	No
2480	These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	No
13485	But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	Yes
17590	Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	No
35954	The Iraq war was backed by Donald.	Yes
11966	I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	No
16630	When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	Yes
13627	So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	No
20237	I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	No
13323	Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	No
14568	"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	No
25180	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	No
159	And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	Yes
23860	I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	No
7842	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	Yes
28637	And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	No

33280	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	No
25341	And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	No
8536	And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	No

7697	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	No
26656	And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	Yes

21572	I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.	Yes
35068	In reality, I brought together Republicans and Democrats to achieve the passage of a patient's bill of rights in Texas.	Yes
32479	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	No
17593	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	Yes
37488	Mr. Perot will reveal that the expert he hired to assess his proposal suggests that it will lead to a deficit reduction in five years, but unemployment will persist for four more years.	Yes
11090	I've been in them all my life.	No
36652	Our exploration of oil reserves has only begun, and we have leased out approximately 2% of the outer continental shelf, where it is believed by those with knowledge of this fuel and energy source that there may be significant amounts remaining.	Yes
29040	Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	Yes
1876	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	No

28323	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	No
8960	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	No
19833	It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	No
10543	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	No
38171	During January 1975, he requested a tax reform that would increase taxes on low-and-middle-income individuals by $5.6 billion and decrease taxes for corporations and special interests by $6 and half million.	Yes
15540	The Vice President talks about national security.	No
37576	The American people, including Perot supporters, are aware that I have been and will be a vocal supporter of campaign finance reform.	Yes
38219	I declared in April that the presence of Russian peacekeepers in disputed areas in Georgia was not sustainable.	Yes
38335	The reduction of government spending and the increase in GDP, which have decreased from 17 to 6 percent, are expected to balance these two lines.	Yes
23171	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	No
38436	Despite the fact that most employers in the country are paying more for their health insurance to compensate hospitals for free medical care for uninsured workers, Mr. Bush believes that it is not reasonable for businesses to provide health coverage for employees.	Yes
37964	The same applies to highways as well.	Yes
38002	We've done it in other states.	Yes

28464	Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	No
17897	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	No
36572	In the past, we had a total of 18.	Yes
7602	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	Yes
37949	To enhance the quality of life for our soldiers, their families, and training, I have suggested a range of new investments.	Yes
17992	We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	No
28492	And that means keeping our military strong.	No
35762	When Senator Kennedy mentions the House Rules Committee's action, it should be noted that there are eight Democrats and four Republicans on the committee.	Yes

38490	Other Americans have been targeted because of their race or ethnicity.	Yes
34758	We assumed we had a 75-year fixation in 1983.	Yes
4384	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	No
17451	And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	Yes
24427	This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	No

12014	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	Yes
22483	Our schools are now better.	No
14176	There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	Yes
16031	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	No
23853	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	Yes
29053	I want to have the military keeping the peace.	No
8436	But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	No
36611	My statement was that I would work towards achieving tax relief for middle-class Americans.	Yes
34799	According to him, trickle-down economics was voodiceous and he now practices it as its biggest advocate.	Yes
13750	I want the line-item veto.	No
29598	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	No
15255	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	Yes
13916	I do understand how to make things work.	No
28057	We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	Yes
12247	We have a very different outlook.	No
35950	And that's precisely what I did.	Yes
12820	But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	No
37341	Mr. Ford remains resolute in his decision not to move forward.	Yes
6977	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	Yes
29326	You were totally in favor of it.	Yes
15649	And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	No
7253	The people I talked to their spirits were high.	No
21619	That's the problem with our system.	No

38464	In his testimony on the food stamp plan in 1957, Mr. Benson stated that 25 million Americans were unable to afford a basic diet.	Yes
22793	General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	Yes
8739	all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.	No
18660	We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	No
2996	When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	Yes
32896	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	No
35435	Excuses: My Medicare reform package benefits only 5% of seniors.	Yes
1507	And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	No
9257	But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	No
39459	Chiang Kai-shek refused to retreat; the President was unsuccessful.	Yes
36160	The Government has taken hundreds of millions of acres of land out of circulation, which is believed by the most discerning oil geologists to contain more oil and natural gas than we have uncovered since drilling the first well 121 years ago.	Yes
34679	A scarcity of oil in world markets is likely to occur as a result of at least five credible studies, including one from the American Petroleum Institute (American Petroleum Association). This suggests that global demand for oil will exceed total available supplies by the end of the decade.	Yes
17396	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	Yes
14183	I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	No
2889	Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	No
34901	We lowered taxes for the 15 million working Americans.	Yes
38452	She was granted it by the United States Congress.	Yes
23315	We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	Yes
17508	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
25407	Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	No
465	As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	Yes
17997	Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	No
7458	"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."	No
17715	Well, it isn't going to go back up.	No
1501	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	Yes
19959	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	No
20377	If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	Yes
8071	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	No
35696	The previous Administration's classrooms were three times larger than those built during the Truman administration, and Eisenhower is now being discussed in relation to schools.	Yes
37153	The reason why my state has surpassed all other industrial states in America in terms of crime reduction is due to this.	Yes
3049	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	No
16992	It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	No
3919	What he said was a precipitous...	No
2951	If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	No
28145	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	No
23592	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	No
16690	This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	Yes
15492	But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	No
7459	"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	No
37592	In the Middle East, we relied on the Baghdad Pact, but it fell apart when the Iraqi Government was changed.	Yes
37735	The safety of New York City was greatly improved by the implementation of stop-and-frisk measures.	Yes
36505	President Bush is the only president who has taken a step forward in history.	Yes
5765	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	No
4320	But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	No
7283	And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	Yes
38611	A migratory bird act was implemented to hunt down 20 or 25 birds and criminalize their killing.	Yes
22589	And that sends a confusing signal to people.	No
24022	We simply cannot pull back.	No
10716	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	No
36089	Cocaine consumes 160 percent of the total.	Yes
26588	But these are important questions.	No
16624	In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	Yes
19410	We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	Yes
9652	In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	Yes
34972	The Guards and Reserves are performing two distinct functions.	Yes
35982	The fact that we are still avoiding the Glaspie papers is completely distracting me.	Yes
19781	That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	No
19525	Well, I have a different view.	No
37792	The latest announcement indicated that the rate of inflation is below 5 percent, and the 4.4 percent implied during the 4 percent GNP was lower than the previous day's reading.	Yes
34579	The announcement that I would be bringing out the troops in six months was not made by me.	Yes
38570	The policy you had in place when you ran in 1992 was based on the idea of training and arming Muslims to defend themselves.	Yes
25069	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	No
25781	I know you do it.	No
39169	To ensure the safety, efficiency, and protection of our energy sources, we have increased our research and development efforts in nuclear power through the Energy Research and Development Agency.	Yes
1476	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	No
14332	That gets to the national honor.	No
754	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	No
38711	Half of the medical practitioners we track claim to refuse to accept more Medicare patients.	Yes
18911	I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	No
38749	To be clear, the budget from last year incurred $18 billion in earmarks.	Yes
9812	It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	Yes
35271	Our achievements and failures at Geneva have been influenced by the limited efforts of staff across the federal government in dealing with this issue.	Yes
39057	A European Air Force General recently stated that we will soon be faced with airplanes without engines and tank commanders who cannot drive their tanks beyond three-quarters of a mile due to indiscriminate fuel usage.	Yes
35867	Our inventory includes MRT (ton of nuclear reactor technology) warheads, which are equivalent to tens of megatons or one millionth of a million.	Yes
33045	We have to guard our energy companies.	No
35608	During the president's invasion, thirty-five to forty countries in the world were more proficient at producing weapons than Saddam Hussein.	Yes
35681	You are doing the same thing with your donors and special interests, which is even more significant.	Yes
26385	The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	Yes
35567	As president, I have raised the federal contribution to water treatment plants by more than 60 percent.	Yes
19915	I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	No
20614	I think that's the wrong thing.	No
17847	Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	No
35224	In Chicago, 46% of teachers who teach in public schools opt to send their students to private schools instead of attending schools.	Yes
19956	Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	No
38751	It is with great respect that you have already given them to the oil companies.	Yes
4047	I know what our needs are.	No
36593	Many places have a police force that is out of control.	Yes
36763	"From the largest deficits eight years ago, we have risen to now the biggest surpluses in history."""	Yes
26540	It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	No
19186	Well, I guess some may be better off.	No
36562	Secretary Bill Perry played a role in negotiating that during President Clinton's presidency.	Yes
16852	What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	No
7654	That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	Yes
10159	But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	No
11077	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	No
14106	On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.	Yes
3430	How's it going to affect my house?	No
7520	And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	No
2371	Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	Yes
1578	As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	Yes
37627	The thought of a large, coordinated conference was not worth it, as the individuals were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, and Israeli citizens.	Yes
16456	And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	No
22221	But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	No
9650	You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	No
37157	Upon my invitation to Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to Washington, where they had a three-hour private conversation, I believed they needed an opportunity to make that peace.	Yes
36958	I believe that we need to tighten the embargo on the Belgrade government and reconsider lifting the arms embargo on Bosnians, as their actions against a heavily armed ethnic cleansing enemy are not fair.	Yes
13018	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	No
38889	The reason I opposed the federal government's payment of teachers' salaries was likely the same reason that worried Senator Kennedy in his January press conference, where he expressed his support for aiding school construction, but did not believe in the need for assistance with teachers-salary funds.	Yes
37020	That has increased by $2,500 annually.	Yes
7992	And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.	No
19594	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	No
7667	And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	No
37301	His stance is in favor of registering firearms.	Yes
8035	I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	No
35810	The total tax amount is greater than the expenses for food, clothing, and shelter under this regime.	Yes
16792	"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	No
37768	Based on my proposal and Donald's proposal, independent experts have concluded that the implementation of his tax plan would result in a loss of 3.5 million jobs and potentially another recession, as it could negatively impact the middle class and the wealthy.	Yes
17035	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	No
12171	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	Yes
891	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	No
15639	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	No
23527	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	No
10698	And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	No
23199	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	Yes
36361	Is there someone who will not veto a bill that provides investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits, like Mr. Bush did?	Yes
8358	I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	No
1267	In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	Yes
25808	Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	No
5918	Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	No
39250	States like Arizona and Rhode Island have demonstrated their affordability by accepting Medicaid dollars.	Yes
6783	Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	No
15642	And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	No
23684	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	No
35335	Additionally, presented a suggestion that was adopted and utilized throughout my tenure as the judge or district attorney on merit for selecting all attorneys.	Yes
15808	I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	No
37704	The President asserts that he wants to decrease or eliminate nuclear weapons.	Yes
38345	My assertion was validated by fact-checking.	Yes

38494	The reason why we have experienced such a challenging job is partly due to our personal experience of watching our husband grow from 0 to 200 billion dollars in deficit, creating 23 million new jobs and raising the income level for everyone.	Yes
7988	And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	No
32414	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	No
2517	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	No
35404	Despite my belief that the assault weapons ban should be extended, I was informed that it would not be implemented due to opposition from both Republicans and Democrats.	Yes
24746	And you have to have cost controls, yes.	No
37568	The lack of plans to retrain and invest in the future technologies at home has resulted in 200,000 people being unemployed in California alone due to our defense cuts.	Yes

36993	Housing has started to show signs of growth.	Yes
37311	The individual responsible for the killing has not been brought to trial, and it is unclear who was actually responsible.	Yes

Yes
26012	I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	No
37406	At present, our country lacks a comprehensive energy program or policy.	Yes
38977	There was no impact on the benefits.	Yes
11328	I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	No
38813	Our plan entails reducing the tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.	Yes
23500	A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	No
193	So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	No
21450	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	Yes
15489	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	No
29778	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	No
965	I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	No
35848	The government's request during the war led to the production of surplus products by the farmer.	Yes
38296	He made an effort to avoid bringing it near my desk.	Yes
15277	So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	No
34487	The Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by almost everyone, claims that virtually all economic analyses I've come across suggest we will still have a deficit of $263 billion, even with historically strong growth.	Yes
39401	Just like how the computer was initially created by government scientists to learn about communication and defense, this is also a matter of national security.	Yes
36923	When considering the absolute gap, we observe that the United States is significantly ahead of it in comparison to two decades ago.	Yes
25118	Our position happened to be at the airport.	No
25153	Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	Yes
38432	Peace has been maintained by the United States through our alliances.	Yes

35896	The number of Americans without health insurance in this country is five million.	Yes
14492	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	No

21376	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	Yes

38187	A significant proportion of our military members are not compensated adequately.	Yes
26617	And we need to make it stronger.	No
37604	Almost all of the individuals who contributed to her, including Buffett and Soros, have been identified as donors.	Yes
39254	Hillary Clinton intends to terminate all mining activities.	Yes
7606	Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	No
30210	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	Yes
25647	I was just going to -- --	No
24676	And they will make those sacrifices.	No
24058	And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	Yes
36704	It is true that we are spending $200 billion annually on human needs, which accounts for almost half of the federal government's total expenditure, according to Mr. Kraft.	Yes
14189	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	No
1560	The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	No
38767	According to the Office's estimates, fraud alone could result in the loss of tens of billions and waste even more.	Yes
21191	You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	No
34288	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	No
39498	At present, 47 million individuals are utilizing food stamps.	Yes
12904	He says he supports the President's position.	Yes
16608	Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	Yes
20104	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	Yes
29668	I'll give you an example.	No
31906	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	No
37992	He was unsuccessful in winning an Emmy for his TV show for three years straight and started tweeting that the Emmies were orchestrated against him.	Yes

39010	As soon as I assumed office, I arranged meetings with the NATO leaders in Brussels to explore ways of strengthening the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	Yes
35042	It was not handled by the administration.	Yes
26917	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	No
6208	And that's the kind of judge that I want.	No
32158	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	No
38891	In a Gallup Poll conducted in February, individuals from ten countries were asked which country would be considered the first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	Yes
7402	I think we've got a lot more work to do.	No
10257	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	No
35907	Then I heard them running for the Senate in New York, and Hillary's plan to revive jobs in upstate New york was unsuccessful.	Yes
2384	And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	No
26225	But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	No
3688	They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	Yes
17030	In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	No
20107	I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.	Yes
36153	In fact, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the interests of United States national security.	Yes
24018	I have cut defense spending.	Yes
15353	Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	No
26201	As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	No
35441	The fact that he opposed the middle class tax cut was not disclosed, as his veto was due to the need to finance it through higher taxes on the wealthy and an investment tax credit funded by raising taxes for the rich.	Yes
25870	I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	Yes
5768	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	Yes
6795	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	No
36114	In 1971, I opposed a Constitutional amendment in the House of Representatives twice, not once, but with the aim of reinstating prayer in public schools.	Yes
26288	How do we pay for it?	No
34748	Governor, you suggested that the captivity of Gadhafi was a result of mission creep and miscommunication upon his return to power.	Yes
35409	The removal of James Schlesinger caused a significant political upheaval and the return of roughly $3 billion in compensation.	Yes
35680	Your donors and special interests are following my lead, but with more frequency.	Yes
23129	Let me see where to start here.	No
21706	In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	Yes
21347	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	No
35431	From the recommendations of the budget committees and projections, it appears that a $60 billion dividend will not be forthcoming.	Yes
21500	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	No
2112	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	No
22083	You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.	No
34924	Our apologies for flying over Eastern Germany were made by this Administration.	Yes
26390	We're going to do that with an economic package.	No
10857	The bad news is we lost.	No
34855	The office of the drug czar was cut 83 percent by you.	Yes
4104	Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	No
27478	But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	No
36902	17 new taxes, price controls, and 50 new bureaucracies.	Yes
3660	Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	No
6510	No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	No
24631	First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	No
12443	This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.	No
36406	"On the day when I was in the Situation Room, watching the raid that resulted in Osama bin Laden's arrest, he hosted the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	Yes
16377	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	Yes
36881	A tax cut for the wealthy has not been effective.	Yes
15673	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	No
21550	I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	No
38859	The first arms control agreement was obtained by him.	Yes
13278	He didn't take that position on Tibet.	Yes
14745	This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	No
12406	And we need to do something about that.	No
23642	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	No
33279	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	No
6224	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	No
13406	And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	No
26191	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	Yes
27166	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	No
39205	Two and a half million more Americans have lost their jobs since he became president.	Yes
2146	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	No
35569	Our plan includes bringing 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	Yes
37815	Despite being independent in the past three years, Guinea and Ghana have both joined the support of the Soviet foreign policy at the UN.	Yes
38845	We have sold at least six million metric tons in the last five and three quarters, which means that we have already purchased four million tonnes this year and will likely purchase another two million tons to meet the demand for grain and corn and wheat that American farmers have grown.	Yes
36722	It's difficult for me to comprehend how we managed to invade a nation that was unintentional in the 9/11 attacks, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are busy creating bases and hiding places to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
7581	Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	No
38448	It's a tragedy that these radical Islamic terrorists are so appalling.	Yes
23900	I think character is a very important question.	No
26781	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	No
32647	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	No
24519	You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	No
25249	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	No
30244	It well describes the problem.	No
10353	We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	No
16251	(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	No
13260	Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	Yes
32511	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	No
35461	We are the most expensive nation in terms of healthcare.	Yes
35932	Our incomes are starting to improve, and we have had a long history of job growth.	Yes
19483	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	Yes
17466	So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	No
39286	A Clear Skies Initiative was introduced to the United States Congress by me, which aimed to decrease sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury by 70 percent.	Yes
37836	I am in favor of the Brady bill that would mandate a nationwide waiting period until Virginia can automate its records, which is the only state that has done so.	Yes
2096	But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	No
16152	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	No
12124	So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	No
32265	They'll never be the same.	No
14264	And I just had to work that in.	No
4020	"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	No
37502	The final candidate to reveal that he knew who his cabinet would be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	Yes
7943	So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	No
11175	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	No
39359	The economic adviser in charge was recently asked why he didn't offer specific programs to assist young people in college, and the answer was that we cannot provide financial assistance to every interest group.	Yes
19374	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	No
15253	We cannot cast aside these regulations.	No
38603	The production of goods and the employment of around 20,000 to 20 million people annually from farms in urban areas is crucial for their company's ability to prevent global chaos.	Yes
38917	This is below the tally of five percent growth in the second quarter and nine point-point-two percent increase in revenue in Q2.	Yes
23614	But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	No
34733	For three months straight, I've been fighting for Congress to pass incentives for small businesses.	Yes
15186	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	No
38147	They were not seen for two months, and the American Ambassador was absent for almost eight months.	Yes
11513	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	No
1300	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	Yes
36302	It is safe to assume that we have energy sources that have not been discovered or utilized yet.	Yes
35090	Lobbyists and special interests are often responsible for introducing these requests, as he correctly pointed out, but I didn't encounter this situation.	Yes
16291	Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	No
1748	And so the question is how to get them going again.	No
14929	But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	Yes
10551	On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	Yes
33883	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	No
28700	I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	No
26003	Let's talk about them separately.	No
37741	The past few years have seen the interdiction of these individuals at Quemoy and Matsu, Indochina, Lebanon, and other places.	Yes
36035	It's important to keep in mind that a tax cut is only intended to reduce if not increased taxes, as the Administration has left us with an implicit $86 billion tax increase projected next year.	Yes
16854	These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	Yes
34683	I have presented the US Congress with four distinct budgets, each containing different details about their programs.	Yes
24030	And I don't want to do that.	No
38836	Health care is not purchased by the individual who relies on it, as a result.	Yes
36723	I am puzzled as to why we invaded a country that was not targeted on 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are using base camps and safe havens to train terrorists for attacks.	Yes
32522	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	Yes
12800	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	No
34098	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	No
12113	If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	No
32818	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	Yes
22283	Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	No
14900	So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	No
32241	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	No
35526	I believe my record is a solid one, considering my opposition to sending the Marines to Lebanon, supporting our efforts in Kosovo, Bosnia, and the first Gulf War.	Yes
34760	Despite his proposal to increase spending by $2.2 trillion, the tax on the wealthy, which is also a tax burden on small business owners in America, has raised approximately $600 million according to our calculations.	Yes
8381	Not reducing the interest -	No
6844	We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	No
33594	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	No
11582	I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	No
19805	But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	No
34752	The Internal Revenue Service has estimated that we are not collecting tax debts exceeding $100 billion in this nation.	Yes
28144	You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.	No
34699	He advocates for fiscal conservatism, but he went too far by voting 277 times to remove the budget restrictions, which would have cost taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	Yes
8538	The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	No
37894	During the previous special session and subsequent one, the Democratic Congress, which had a two-to-one Democratic majority, was asked by the President to grant us funds and authority over the job. However, Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson rejected these requests, ultimately voting against them and refusing to give us powers that were already in our hands.	Yes
29496	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	No
39151	In 1960, our schools were the envy of the world and we spent $16 billion on them. Today, we spend more than any other country in the global education market, accounting for 199 billion annually and ranking at the bottom of its industrialized peers in education achievement.	Yes
19800	We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	No
16998	The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.	No
34780	They are not required to pay an extra $6,000.	Yes
22868	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	Yes
851	I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	No
9941	Instead let people make their own choice.	No
32103	And so please, go to...	No
37540	New York City has been put on a cross-country spending freeze by Mayor Bloomberg.	Yes
38084	The inflation rate of 7% in the third quarter of this year is still too high, but it proves that the inflationary threat is urgent and not just fortuitous.	Yes
13481	Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	No
20503	As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	No
38309	Unfortunately, I was correct: The barracks bombing resulted in the death of almost 300 Marines.	Yes
38866	According to the statistics, there has been an increase of approximately 8 million people living below the poverty line compared to 4 years ago.	Yes
3288	And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.	No
37780	We are leaving the country to pursue our jobs.	Yes
37135	The likelihood of being turned off increases when the government has seven and a half million unemployed, inflation is three times higher than during the last eight years of Democratic rule, and families are struggling to afford college or housing.	Yes
28861	If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	No
25051	We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	No
2628	So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	Yes
36015	There has been an overestimation of premiums.	Yes
36546	By nineteen sixty-one, two and three, they will be ahead of us in terms of missiles.	Yes
38650	I contribute hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
25563	Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	No
33412	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	Yes
35135	According to the report I mentioned, Saddam Hussein was using the oil-for-food strategy as a means of getting rid of sanctions.	Yes
38263	The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was passed on to him.	Yes
2082	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	No
32679	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	Yes
34465	Mr. Bush's commitment to voodoo economics, expanding employment opportunities, and supporting an export enhancement program for farmers that he had threatened to reject, coupled with his persistent efforts to make trust a matter of concern, is truly admirable.	Yes
8426	But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	No

36803	We have been importing one million barrels from Saddam Hussein as of today.	Yes
7083	There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	No
1049	I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	Yes
37773	I, along with Joe Lieberman, journeyed around the world to investigate the consequences of greenhouse gases.	Yes
7619	We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	Yes

38956	As a final point, I have authorized and signed more beautiful rivers and wilderness areas than any other president in U.S. history.	Yes

38233	We're utilizing roughly half of our steel capacity today.	Yes
27825	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	Yes
23029	Just want to make sure they're safe.	No
1287	I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	No
38159	The debt has surpassed the trillion-dollar mark, leaving the next U.S. president with a list of options.	Yes
35813	After the murder of Sergio de Mello, they withdrew.	Yes
35826	My balanced budget includes a tax package that would exempt ordinary Americans from up to $500k in capital gains from selling their homes, which is the most significant benefit we could provide.	Yes
26028	I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	No
35043	The administration did not address it.	Yes
8280	You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	No
16449	There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	No
28200	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	No
20957	They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	Yes
37564	Our agreement has aimed to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	Yes
39163	In the previous year, we had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion.	Yes
36540	He didn't adopt that perspective on Tibet.	Yes
23947	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	No
37270	The notion that our country is being ripped off by every country on the planet is necessary because we have an almost $800 billion trade deficit each year.	Yes
21731	I didn't get to make a comment on this.	No
7285	Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.	No
29889	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	Yes
19736	So it's not that we always disagree.	No
37636	The failure to meet fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles per gallon will result in the dismissal of many auto workers, and it's not possible to have both options.	Yes
33328	Now, I want to build the wall.	No

39105	A proposal of $45 billion is suggested by the governor.	Yes
23715	There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	No
16799	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	Yes
39083	Double-digit inflation, the Carter-Mondale administration's interest rates of 211/2 percent, and the grain embargo had a devastating effect on the farmers, who were negatively impacted by our unreliable supplier status nationwide.	Yes
37675	This means that taxes on nine million people will be raised, along with larger cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and education in areas such as the environment compared to those proposed by him and Mr. Gingrich, which I vetoed last year.	Yes
35050	Taxing individuals who are above $200,000 will not result in a tax bill of $150 billion.	Yes
2226	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	No
8115	But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	No
4041	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	No
22373	Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	No
9226	That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	Yes
35258	My proposal to the Congress, given a budget ceiling of 395 billion dollars, resulted in an additional $25 billion in tax reduction.	Yes
19873	And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	Yes
13405	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	No
8068	It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	No
1470	And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	Yes
24735	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	Yes
32847	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	No
14565	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
13476	Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	No
27870	And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	No
20118	He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	No
35274	"Due to her Latino background, he gave her the nickname ""Miss Housekeeping."""	Yes
35045	Restoring manufacturing in our country to create jobs, as seen in the auto industry, rather than compensating companies that send workers overseas.	Yes
30216	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	Yes
8797	As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	Yes
9935	Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	Yes
9029	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	No
20338	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	Yes
35423	John mentioned that the shortage of non-commissioned officers is such that they would not be necessary to train the draftees if we had a draft today.	Yes
17600	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	No
513	Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	No
25598	I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	No
39379	The number of people who lost their jobs was nine million.	Yes
5805	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	Yes
15875	We may think that you deal with them in different ways.	No
35320	I will not accept Vietnam's admission to the United Nations if they do not provide a comprehensive account of their missing in action.	Yes
33173	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	No
171	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.	No
8730	All of these things can be done.	No
36630	I have balanced the government budget 12 times out of 3 of us, proposed and passed campaign finance reform, advocated for public referendum lobbyist restrictions, and accomplished all the necessary tasks to rally legislators together.	Yes
35333	That's precisely what the president did when he used his veto power to block the Family Leave Act.	Yes
38888	Senator Kennedy expressed concern in his kick-off press conference in January that my opposition to paying teacher's salaries was the reason he supported aid for school construction, but did not believe it was necessary.	Yes

37870	Every man, woman, and child in this country spends six hundred dollars to cover their healthcare expenses.	Yes
13401	In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	No
8356	Mine has been in the executive branch.	No
21545	So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	No
7193	But let me go a step further.	No
27532	And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	No
16702	I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.	Yes
34362	It may be because of our experiences.	No
17884	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	No
23963	So that is where my income limit would trigger.	No
15199	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	No
36856	They were convicted by a jury.	Yes
34176	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	No
35991	With these significant tax reductions, Donald's proposal will result in a $20 trillion government debt increase.	Yes
23659	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	No
8435	This is not enough; it should be more.	No
24194	And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	No
34808	He has requested $932 million in earmark pork-barrel spending, which is almost one million dollars for each day he spends in the United States Senate.	Yes
27727	That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	Yes
32710	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	No
12818	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	No
15245	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	Yes
38899	In contrast, Governor Romney's primary economic strategy calls for a $5 trillion tax cut in addition to the extension of the Bush tax cuts, which would incur an additional $2 trillion in military spending that hasn't been requested.	Yes
17149	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	Yes
36038	His representative had been instructed by him to surrender all sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone to the locals after a specific period.	Yes
34897	We have a deficit of $2.6 trillion at present.	Yes
28439	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	No
37382	In 1981, the introduction of massive deficits resulted in a two-fold increase in real interest rates, which remains unchanged today.	Yes
38416	Our imports have decreased by 2 million barrels compared to the previous year.	Yes
34459	The two boxes of emails and other items that were stolen from an office are the most significant pieces of information you should be apologizing for, as they were deleted due to acid washing.	Yes
15030	We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	No
32706	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	No
36141	Our school performance was exceptional in my state, earning us the distinction of being among the top schools in the country.	Yes
17761	Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	No
18118	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	No
38207	The President was against it in 1993.	Yes
30247	It's not an accurate one.	No
19296	I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	No
2991	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	No
15229	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	No
36558	He served two terms in the Senate, one of which was his second term.	Yes
21213	And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	No
1796	Now, that's not my analysis.	No
34609	The administration has been conducting business with Noriega, as he says.	Yes
19582	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	Yes
36311	The president who speaks about No Child Left Behind declined to provide the full funding for the program, which is valued at $28 billion, in order to help young people.	Yes
26632	See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	No
35218	Ranking fourth in terms of manufacturing jobs, poverty reduction is fourth, while income increases are fourth.	Yes
38060	We not only fixed Medicare and carried it forward, but also managed to balance the budget in a way that was unfamiliar to most people.	Yes
6952	We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	Yes
38143	However, it should be noted that this legislation includes only 5% of the employers and none of them, including all employees, are covered by this act.	Yes
38932	In exchange, receive one-fifth of the advantages, as the majority of tax reductions are redirected to those in the lowest economic bracket.	Yes
444	And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	No
38690	Despite the fact that taxes have been cut, the Federal Government's income has decreased by 25 percent in the past three years.	Yes
17503	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	No
29655	And we need to be very clear about that.	No
25036	I will keep this nation strong.	No
10443	And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	No
20459	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	No
3302	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	Yes
16832	Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	No
37959	Two arrangements will be made by them.	Yes
25531	But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.	No
2654	I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	No
38770	Despite being proven false, it doesn't deter him from speaking his mind.	Yes
27072	It's their route to the sea.	No
34827	The inability of this administration to work together in a peaceful resolution to the Central American conflict has resulted in diminished diplomatic skills.	Yes
20170	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	No
7709	Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	No
26978	They don't happen to be accurate.	No
38935	For seven years, the number of uninsured individuals has increased.	Yes
25068	Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	No
16638	Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	Yes
23566	I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	No
29693	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	No
11300	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	No
17874	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	No
7189	I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	No
36109	The negotiation made by Carla Hill has lowered the barrier to products, and we are the ones who have done so.	Yes
12848	I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	No
28161	That adds up to 44 million people.	Yes
21939	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	No
10220	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	Yes
36986	It's difficult to believe that after eight years, you will be the one to lead and control spending while balancing tax cuts for middle-class families.	Yes
38104	I aimed to raise $4.9 billion for AIDS in the current year, which is ten times more than the amount needed by each individual with HIV and cancer.	Yes
34966	The Senate bill was overridden by Republicans, who only managed to secure one vote and seven votes in the House.	Yes
1522	So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	Yes
25967	Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	No
20882	The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	Yes
17805	That's why I want another 4 years.	No
37902	By requesting the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share, offering tax relief worth over $100 billion in incentives for new plants, small businesses, new technologies, middle class families, and spending cuts totaling $140 billion, we can simultaneously increase investment and decrease the deficit.	Yes
16984	There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	No
37343	Considering the significant reduction in Red Army numbers due to the arms control agreement signed between President Bush and President Yeltsin, I am of the opinion that we cannot afford or need to maintain 150,000 troops in Europe.	Yes
17468	And no one has approached it from that matter.	No
21118	That is what it is.	No
35841	The next few months will see us spending $7 billion on reconstruction.	Yes
38776	The death toll of American citizens reached three thousand.	Yes
24462	So I do think we need to strengthen family.	No
13669	Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	Yes
23221	That's the way we leave it.	No
24963	I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	No
12814	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	Yes
18610	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	No
29393	... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	Yes
38134	Upon receiving the phone call, I made sure to secure the Americans who were still in danger, conduct an exact investigation, and bring to justice those responsible for American deaths, as I mentioned in the previous debate.	Yes
15378	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	No
19561	He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	Yes
6723	As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	No
20904	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	No
2814	That's got to be changed.	No
37476	It is true that we are importing about one-third less oil from overseas today than we did a year ago.	Yes
35984	When I was in the early 1990s, I backed Nunn-Lugar while many of my colleagues didn't.	Yes
32284	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	Yes
22490	You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	No
37814	In the past three years, Guinea and Ghana have become independent countries and are now supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the UN.	Yes
37269	One-third of the president's budget is subject to the Congress, who has the power to allocate and oversee expenditures.	Yes
22192	So we've got to innovate through school choice.	No
36213	Iran is taking action against ISIS.	Yes
36799	There are more individuals who meet the requirements.	Yes
8031	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	No
11400	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	No
16399	This election is about big things.	No
4015	So I have a record.	No
39209	The problems in Yugoslavia have resulted in the arrival of 2 million refugees, which is the highest number since World War II, and there may be many more who will suffer from starvation or freezing in winter.	Yes
15523	And so I have great confidence in him.	No
36177	We established an unparalleled alliance, defeated him, and eliminated the fourth largest army.	Yes
29836	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	Yes
38516	The current mayor put an end to it.	Yes
38226	Exxon Mobil's record-breaking profits of $12 billion over the past few quarters have allowed them to make a concession to ordinary families struggling to afford food and college education.	Yes
14383	They investigated every single one of my children.	Yes
16956	It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	No
17154	"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	No
36466	Under Obamacare, you've boosted them by $1 trillion.	Yes
34605	The expansion of public school choice options was one of my campaign proposals, and I advocated for the funding of 3,000 new schools to assist states.	Yes
38214	Governor Romney has previously stated that he would only advocate for the repeal of Dodd-Frank and urges it to be reversed.	Yes
8701	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	No
18894	I did a lot of work on this.	No
36666	Despite my constant public advocacy for drug legalization, I am still not in favor of it.	Yes
28885	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	No
29200	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	Yes
10772	So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	No
35623	My record as a member of Congress is marked by my repeated condemnations of antisemitism and racism.	Yes
38023	You had loan officers who were providing loans and mortgages that were undeservedly denied to those who did not meet the criteria.	Yes
12460	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	No
24254	And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	No
38180	The Shanghai Communique affirms that the disputes between the People's Republic and Taiwan will be resolved through peaceful means.	Yes
18235	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	No
6333	By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	Yes
6908	I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	Yes
21165	I want to focus on results.	No
28896	No, I'm not proud of that.	No
37700	The tax burden on the middle class has increased while the wealthiest have decreased under President Bush's leadership.	Yes
19699	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	No
116	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	Yes
16572	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	No
18815	We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	Yes
23059	Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	No
3846	He raised a whole bunch of them.	No
35070	Those who know me are aware that there has been a greater number of young people trying drugs, and drug use has increased.	Yes
38237	According to you, inflation during Mr. Carter's presidency was 4.8%.	Yes
28233	I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	No
38793	I also want to emphasize that Senator Kennedy did not include a 25 percent hike in food prices as part of the program's cost.	Yes
1420	Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	No
15926	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	No
37526	Food stamps are being received by 17,000 men and women who wear our uniform today.	Yes
12879	This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	No
1877	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	No
20001	But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	No
13834	Our government is that point now.	No
29165	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	No
9506	And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	No
7864	He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	No
31932	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	Yes
23102	It's in my health-care proposal.	Yes
1330	Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	No
15284	The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	No
39077	It is my contention that the programs implemented during the Truman Administration, such as the Federal Reserve and interest-free or low-interest interest rates, were primarily focused on the economic side of the economy.	Yes
21341	So what is the answer?	No
38440	Please assist the Democratic-controlled Congress in cutting $70 million from the Coast Guard's narcotics interdiction program.	Yes
36772	It has resulted in the most significant failure of any small business in half a century.	Yes
35629	The Department of State and Defense have confirmed the accuracy of both the report from yesterday and the National Security Agency.	Yes
7669	Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	No
25466	In other words, a President has to make choices.	No
30011	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	Yes
21952	Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	No
19664	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	No
39468	The family income in Connecticut is not as high as that.	Yes
8920	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	Yes
25189	And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	No
1298	There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	Yes
13092	I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	No
33458	People are going to come in from Syria.	No
15404	Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	No
9133	They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	No
37757	Spending more than $18 billion on pork barrels is significant.	Yes
28593	But that's the good news.	No
35965	It is true that our exports to Mexico have risen and our trade deficit has decreased, while the same statement was made about the record-breaking trade imbalance with Japan.	Yes
36997	I also presented to the Congress, and they approved a substantial package of quality-of-life improvements, which are crucial.	Yes
32344	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	No
12414	That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	Yes
11889	And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	No
19961	And so I think you take a look at it.	No
21457	In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	Yes
36786	Is it your perception that the growth rate in recent years has exceeded the mean over the preceding ten years?	Yes
10377	There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	No
2680	We cut taxes 19 times.	Yes
38895	Those with annual incomes of $51,000 or less are subject to an unjustifiable high share of the federal tax burden due to six payroll tax increases, which is why I am seeking some tax relief for the middle class.	Yes
29150	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	Yes
8601	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	No
19566	That would be my position.	No
37533	Today, the average serviceman's salary is at least 15%, which I consider to be a modest estimate, and 15% below the cost of living during that time.	Yes
25991	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	No
21122	The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	Yes
34643	Due to his lack of attendance at meetings, he is not considered the most liberal senator in the United States Senate.	Yes
36368	Mr. Bush is the one who raised taxes on the middle class after stating that he would not.	Yes
37701	Tax revenue for the middle class has increased while that of the rich has decreased under President Bush.	Yes
8757	Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	Yes
37212	Since the recession began, we have added four million new jobs.	Yes
19198	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	No
30243	It's a good one, though.	No
37220	The number of people in this country who are unemployed or have stopped seeking employment is 23 million.	Yes
38906	The CEOs of Fortune 500 companies would receive an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes under his tax plan, while 100 million Americans would not be included.	Yes
20571	It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	No
37458	The number of undocumented immigrants in America is increasing, and they are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	Yes
11903	Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	No
38841	During his time as President, Truman vetoed approximately thirty-eight bills every year.	Yes
20599	But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	No
35630	The production of oil from offshore oiling is currently limited to 2% through leased lines.	Yes
19856	I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	Yes
38842	Their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of the United States, and they also provide coverage for 98% of their population.	Yes
37573	During an oil embargo in 1973, Iran refrained from taking part.	Yes
17158	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	Yes
5558	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	No
36345	It grew at a faster rate than the Federal Government's spending, more than doubling.	Yes
20563	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	No
33092	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	No
2826	We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	No
34625	On Monday, I signed a tax bill that had an amendment and prohibited American companies from receiving monetary deductions for aiding the Arab boycott.	Yes
24730	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	No
38735	This was the location where President Carter had pledged to introduce a comprehensive plan for the reconstruction of the department.	Yes
37322	On average, President Roosevelt vetoed fifty-five bills per year, as per the records.	Yes
34781	There is no need for an extra $6,000.	Yes
30227	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	No
38759	The decline has started, but the growth continues.	Yes
20478	It's the right thing for the consumers.	No
32667	And you know what happens?	No
13254	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	No
22247	Those schools belong to you.	No
8089	And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	Yes
20420	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	No
38389	Furthermore, it was the initial national security decision we had to make.	Yes
35687	We entered the Beirut area at their request due to the ongoing war between Israel and PLO terrorists.	Yes
34520	I should emphasize that it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to participate in it.	Yes
38838	It has been done by a total of seventy-two countries.	Yes
494	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	No
14848	This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	No
36664	The watchdogs that monitor foundations have given us the highest recommendation.	Yes
36398	When Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies, the president didn't stand up for Boeing.	Yes
28959	But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	Yes
8480	It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	No
35173	My hard work paid off, and I was ecstatic to be re-elected in New York by a much larger margin than when I first won.	Yes
16807	It shows a lack of leadership.	No
22369	I hope a lot of --	No
39097	17 intelligence agencies, both civilian and military, have determined that the Kremlin's top brass is responsible for cyberattacks and espionage attacks that are intended to impact our election.	Yes
13722	It's a fairly rural state.	No
39090	The Cuba Democracy Act was passed by Congress in 1992 before I became President, and I implemented it with great success.	Yes
38788	We have the world's second-best military.	Yes
3927	And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	No
29461	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	No
34678	There will be a scarcity of oil in world markets due to at least five credible studies, including one from the American Petroleum Institute, which indicate that the total global demand for oil will exceed the available supplies by the end of the decade.	Yes
37155	Over the course of 100 years, George's Boston Harbor was tainted.	Yes
37004	The unemployment rolls have registered a little over 500,000 Americans in the past four months.	Yes
36776	At least 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been prohibited from accessing handguns under the Brady Bill.	Yes
12831	Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	No
24257	And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	No
13880	I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	No
34496	Have you been informed that the Com- sends ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as it does from Russia?	Yes
20012	You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	Yes
39256	The primary beneficiaries of the $2.8 billion are small businesses, such as drilling companies.	Yes
22941	Eight countries have left it.	Yes
37415	My tax cut is the most significant since Ronald Reagan.	Yes
27900	No, I am not wrong.	No
35878	I am aware that my opposition to air pollution laws in California is widely accepted, but the President may be advocating for a law that the Federal Government attempted to enforce that would prevent individuals from driving vehicles within or outside of city limits.	Yes
4188	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	No
28373	And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	Yes
29677	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	Yes
35420	The year 1953 saw us as the first to rule Latin America, with a total of eleven dictators.	Yes
16167	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	Yes
34493	In his state of the union message, he disclosed non-existent nuclear materials to Congress.	Yes
17478	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	Yes
36898	The amendment authorized the Senate of the United States to take up its position, with a majority of Senators' own and Republican representatives voting in favor of it. This is against the Senator's current position of signaling that the US will not protect the offshore islands.	Yes
12519	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	No
11356	I know what it's like in dark times.	No
16868	My average in two years is twenty-six.	Yes
25587	That's key to the strength of our nation.	No
29783	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	No
19393	These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	No
12043	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	No
16945	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	No
11013	And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	No
4280	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	No
20641	The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	No
22087	What do we have to do?	No
4209	He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	Yes
17408	We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	Yes
163	And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	No
36775	I think it's important for people to understand that two-thirds of the defense budget is allocated towards pay and salary or pension payments.	Yes
36191	The answer to the question is that we were peaceful for 40 years, according to Sander.	Yes
24453	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	No
12531	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	No
34329	We've become very, very sloppy.	No
28661	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	No
17489	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	No
38314	Our industry has been generating more energy over the past few years, with a 12% decrease in energy consumption compared to 1973.	Yes
35134	The report I cited also revealed that Saddam Hussein was using the oil-for-food strategy to eliminate sanctions.	Yes
21921	But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	No
38839	Seventy-two other countries have done it.	Yes
35174	As a senator, I have put up resistance against that.	Yes
18030	And if we lose our will, we lose.	No
24499	We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	Yes
27818	My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	No
8968	And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	No
37147	We have a significant need to provide coverage for the approximately 20 million people and numerous children.	Yes
37338	Our mayor, who had recently been appointed, refused to proceed with the case.	Yes
38654	A few years ago, George Bush stated that Social Security is essentially a welfare system.	Yes
36672	Despite my tax cut, the $86 billion increase remains unaddressed.	Yes
6270	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	No
18715	I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	No
14387	And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	Yes
35737	Only a small fraction of students, around one in 20, would be eligible for these vouchers and would not pay the full tuition fees to private schools.	Yes
199	But, George, that's no answer.	No
29482	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	Yes
36707	We experienced a substantial surge in new permits for housing.	Yes
34772	Small businesses pay the individual rate since 54 percent of American workers work in companies that are taxed at the personal rate rather than the corporate rate.	Yes
20775	Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	Yes
13256	And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	No
16564	So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	No
37127	The defense budget was re-evaluated by him, adding another one point eight billion dollars just before the Kansas City convention.	Yes
35370	The costs of our defense systems are now so uncontrollable that they cannot be managed.	Yes
32211	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	Yes
38686	I have been against the president's policies regarding spending, climate change, prisoner torture, and Guantanamo Bay.	Yes
20173	I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	No
3221	Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	No
27276	We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	No
16802	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	Yes
19109	We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	No
37067	I have suggested a reorganization that is the first step.	Yes
10139	And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	No
187	So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	No
10852	And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.	No
16380	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	No
9514	We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	Yes
38042	The governor of Massachusetts recognized that there was no concrete evidence to support the allegations of Mr. Noriega's drug activity until he was indicted.	Yes
12046	The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	No
25974	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	No
35148	Those who invest in small businesses and hold the investment for five years can now benefit from capital gains.	Yes
38300	Although there was a 3 percent increase this year, it wasn't quite enough.	Yes
37116	With a donation of $14 million from his father, he launched his business and strongly believes that aiding the wealthy will bring about positive change.	Yes
24329	Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.	No
38468	They are now advocating for the implementation of prescription drugs for senior citizens.	Yes
23228	This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	Yes
36162	Iran has a choice thanks to the work we've done with sanctions.	Yes
27090	And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	No
34205	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	No
839	And I believe that he will be outstanding.	No
38985	My plan is to rely on the moral authority of the US to gain satisfaction from prison camps, and I am pleased that we are making headway in receiving humanitarian aid.	Yes
21363	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	Yes
29917	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	No
36748	Despite this, it should be noted that Donald began his career in 1973 when he was sued for racial discrimination by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans. He made sure that those who worked for him were aware of this policy.	Yes
9037	Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	No
8244	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	No
3878	We don't want our kids coming back here.	No
34884	My proposal for a program that would have covered medical care for the elderly in Social Security, paid for through the Social security system and the social security tax, was unsuccessful in the US Senate, where it was defeated by five votes.	Yes
34820	The jobs being created by the president are losing out on $9,000.	Yes
38050	This is being carried out by a multitude of companies.	Yes
26582	Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	No
39501	The Ford administration's failure to appoint delegates to the presidential missions in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and other countries was particularly embarrassing due to their lack of cooperation and concern for human rights.	Yes
28955	We both made promises in this campaign.	No
24073	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	Yes
38139	The flash report for the third quarter suggests that the economy may be recovering from recession, but inflation and mortgage rates have also caused inflation to increase.	Yes
17983	We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	No
8279	Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.	No
35077	The Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates of amendments proposed by automobile manufacturers, whenever they claim that they cannot meet them.	Yes
5568	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	Yes
38369	During the voting, it was communicated to us that the President of the United States would reject any new legislation if it were adopted.	Yes
24259	So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	No
36765	As a result of previous agreements, their goods and products are brought into our country without charge.	Yes
36472	The fact that Russia is now urging for a change in foreign policy due to the Cold War's conclusion has made Governor Romney emphatic about the threat posed by Al Qaida.	Yes
2943	I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	Yes
36784	Our credibility in Pakistan was eroded due to our actions.	Yes
15657	What was he referring to?	No
11171	I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	No
36215	According to Mr. Nixon, only forty-four percent of ours is made in the Soviet Union.	Yes
29699	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	No
39373	In recent times, there has been a 64 percent rise in health-care expenses for the average American, along with augmentations of tuition fees by 35 percent and increases in gas prices by 30 percent. Additionally, Medicare premiums have gone up by 17 percent, and prescription drug prices have increased by 12 percent every year.	Yes

35716	His economic program was not implemented until more than 1300 days into his presidency, and his health care initiative has not been fully presented to Congress yet.	Yes
24461	Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	No
11000	Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	Yes
19162	We'll have specific differences later.	No
676	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
13803	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	No
32889	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	No

15976	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	Yes
24749	I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	Yes
14673	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	Yes
36506	The Soviet Union's belief that they were relying more on land-based missiles led us to bring up all three, which was unexpected.	Yes
36416	There were 12 original copies that were not submitted to the CIA's printing process.	Yes

30249	I agree with her on one thing.	No
27800	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	Yes
37614	Hillary Clinton's plan will entail a substantial hike in taxes.	Yes
25516	And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	No
19217	We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	No
1113	The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	No
24609	"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	No
38862	The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that Obamacare will result in an increase of $2,500 per year compared to traditional insurance, which is unfortunate.	Yes
14680	Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	No
1413	Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.	Yes
822	He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	Yes

33115	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	No
1809	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	No
19387	So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	Yes
34931	While the President exercised his American power in Lebanon, he managed it so well that the marines were killed and we had to leave in humiliation. The Soviet Union gained strength, and terrorists found support.	Yes
6845	People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	No
10463	Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	No
18992	I can't say it any more plainly.	No
34671	Our failure to fix Medicare and Medicaid has resulted in a disorganized system.	Yes
35779	He and I both appointed three individuals to address campaign finance reform.	Yes
37776	The border has experienced a significant increase in control and enforcement.	Yes
36367	If you were against a timetable in Afghanistan, you're now supporting it.	Yes
24081	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	No
39303	We have put forward the idea that we can lower down payments and moderate monthly payments through the h- housing program.	Yes
16685	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	No
18358	Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	Yes
27387	We're now at under 285.	Yes
36444	Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, the government's spending has decreased to 6 percent.	Yes
21771	Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	No
28134	They discover great new cures and that's great.	No
34717	In the event that I have, I will be responsible for paying taxes amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.	Yes
20550	And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	No
1489	I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	Yes
5628	If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	No
2343	It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	No

15384	That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	No
3802	And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	No
22724	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	Yes
15964	But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	Yes
27884	...you've had the floor for a while.	No
16790	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	Yes
36977	12 million families have taken a brief break for medical reasons or illness to attend work without losing their livelihood.	Yes
37258	They will be staying in Texas for approximately eight or nine days.	Yes
2651	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	No
20466	The administration did not deal with it.	Yes
26708	And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	No
23780	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	No
19459	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	No
12561	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	No
27098	We organized the Friends of Syria.	No
25634	They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	No
37313	I have reduced the amount of money allocated to defense.	Yes
13623	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	No
21969	I'll tell you how it's affected me.	No

38356	China's competitiveness cannot be maintained by us.	Yes
28190	We share a common border with another nation.	No
16667	But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	No
3143	I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.	No
27404	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	Yes
29119	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	No
17232	So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	No
17703	I'm opposed to that, too.	No
35012	The United States has seen an increase in its budget over the last ten years, with an average of 11 percent per year.	Yes
36907	The truth is that it's just the way things are.	Yes
37521	Senator Spencer Abraham, who is from Michigan and my friend, is advocating for a law that would ensure respect for Arab-Americans.	Yes
35360	Regrettably, a significant number of toddlers have injured themselves or killed others with firearms because not everyone who has guns in their homes takes necessary precautions.	Yes
34787	We designed the plan to ensure that six million more American families do not pay taxes.	Yes
15423	I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	No
37324	"The irony is that if Obamacare is repealed, and I am no longer inclined towards the term ""Obama"", then those who are older will immediately have to pay an additional $600 for prescription care."	Yes
36031	In 46 states across the country, Race to the Top has resulted in reforms that raise standards and improve teacher training.	Yes
25505	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	Yes
16675	Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	No
29725	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	Yes
13835	The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	No
18517	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	No
34584	They conveyed nuclear secrets to nations like Syria, potentially.	Yes
35947	Once again, we had a drug czar in Arkansas, but this one was the one who communicated with the governor, just like it was with our counterparts in Washington.	Yes
34999	The mission that we must execute in Iran is to prevent it from possessing a nuclear weapon through both peaceful and diplomatic measures.	Yes
37620	Whether we wanted to or not, we have been the safety net for illegal immigrants in Mexico, where their population is increasing and there is no economic support to take them into account and create jobs.	Yes
25199	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	No
2630	And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	Yes
17273	I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	No
8497	And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	No
36944	I voted in favor of this legislation.	Yes
20680	It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	No
8479	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	Yes
20267	I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	Yes
8871	Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	Yes
10662	I know how to do that.	No
24864	Thank you very, very much.	No
25714	But that progress is only the beginning.	No
38976	The benefits were not affected in any way.	Yes
16706	We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	No
19378	But let me respond to what you said.	No
11166	... to -- to -- to...	No
7903	The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.	No
12395	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	Yes
1431	The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	Yes
37158	We're providing them with more funding than ever before, and we'll continue to do so.	Yes
38447	A number of banks are deemed too large to fail and are therefore effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	Yes
3176	So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	No
18198	We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	Yes
8762	Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	No
36424	Senator Dole and his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, have argued that the $550 billion tax plan is too risky and requires cutting Medicare and Social Security to avoid it.	Yes
879	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	No
24804	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	Yes
7811	We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	No
32147	If he wants to start, he can start.	No
2414	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	No
38874	He advocates for medical liability reform, specifically for OB/GYNs.	Yes
38270	She negotiated with oil companies and refused them permission to construct a $40 billion natural gas pipeline that will meet the United States' energy requirements in the lower 48.	Yes
38824	Our home ownership has reached its highest point in 15 years.	Yes
37032	We informed him that we wouldn't intervene in his border dispute and refrained from revealing Ambassador Glaspie's papers from the 25th of July.	Yes
36449	When Mr. Nixon gave his famous speech on Operation Independence, we were importing roughly 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
14931	And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	Yes
1778	So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.	No
29568	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	No
38022	Loan officers were providing loans and mortgages that were not necessary for those who did not meet the requirements.	Yes
15868	Those are basic American values.	No
18395	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	No
34489	One of the things he has done is to allow cyber attackers to hack into government files, personal files or the Democratic National Committee.	Yes
26432	You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	No
37389	Moreover, during this administration, expenditure has surged more than it has in the last 20 years, and he requested that Congress spend more money than they actually spent.	Yes
21235	I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	No
28421	You talk about eight years?	No
1302	And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	No
32031	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	No
38738	I am unable to understand how the president could approach his duties as the head of state, facing unemployment rates, high unemployment numbers, and an economic crisis while spending two years fighting for Obamacare instead of advocating for American jobs.	Yes
19669	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	Yes
14479	I say that to both political parties.	No
38272	The reason for the massive migration, where she is taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who are likely not even there...	Yes
24168	That is what I want to do.	No
36657	By reducing taxes on all taxpayers, increasing the child credit by $1,000, decreasing the marriage penalty to 10.5 percent, setting a 10 percent bracket, and providing relief to taxpayers, we were able to weather the recession more effectively than any other period in history.	Yes
37429	During the cease-fire, Russia took control of vast tracts of land and later declared that it did not want to continue with the operation.	Yes
21178	We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.	No
28827	And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.	No
12607	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	Yes
38306	I have a plan to balance the budget within 6 years.	Yes
35256	The Social Security payroll tax increase, the most significant single tax in our country's history, will only serve to delay the day of reckoning by a few years and leave trillions of dollars out of pocket.	Yes
37044	He thinks that it makes him look more attractive than me because I voted for it.	Yes
39181	The president in the United States, for whom I gave my support, is obligated to defend Formosa, the Pescadores, and potentially these islands militarily.	Yes
34550	The President affixed it.	Yes
35731	Korea's military had a workforce of 3 million five hundred thousand young men, comprising the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.	Yes
38706	You made it clear that we shouldn't be approving nuclear agreements with Russia, even though 71 senators, both Democrats and Republicans, supported the proposal.	Yes
37829	In regards to federal employees, my first order of business after taking office was to reduce or scrap the anticipated forty-thousand increase in government workers that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	Yes
19132	It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	No
18963	I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	No
37708	If you win the election again, we'll end up with a trillion-dollar debt.	Yes
22134	So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	No
34318	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	Yes
36952	We approved a bill for area redevelopment that was much more effective than the Administration's proposal, but the President vetoed it twice.	Yes
6673	They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	No
15910	It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	No
17779	And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	No
34601	Despite Senator Kennedy's repeated assertion that the United States is second in space, with two out of three successful shots being taken during his presidential campaign.	Yes
37798	A tax cut during war has never been granted to the United States of America.	Yes
16057	I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	Yes
35626	None of the six countries has a diplomatic representative representing the United States.	Yes
36065	We're introducing Japanese rice from California to the market.	Yes
37185	Middle-income taxpayers have been buried for the past four years, which is why I want them to receive lower taxes.	Yes
24322	We must rebuild America's strength at home.	No
21855	If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	No
120	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	No
37314	The United States government is collaborating with the private sector to provide funding for innovation that can be exported to countries like China, which has set up one coal power plant per week and requires alternative solutions.	Yes
1575	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	No
5499	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	No
34899	Iran, whom we made very strong, became his new alligator.	Yes
34801	"In the U.N."" vote last Saturday, particularly related to Red China, we were able to secure support for only two African nations: Liberia, which had been under our control for over a century, and the Union of South Africa, an unpopular country in Africa."	Yes
5925	She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	Yes
28665	I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	No
24021	I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	No
37730	In my opinion, it would be more beneficial for the United States to invest in surplus military equipment in Laos instead of concentrating on aid to underdeveloped countries.	Yes
22145	I'll close on this point.	No
24291	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	No
15102	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	No
37172	Your objective is to raise the tax rate for profitable small enterprises from 35 percent to 40 percent.	Yes
17449	I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	No
33284	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	Yes
37692	A bill was presented to the Illinois Senate that demanded life-saving treatment, which would have weakened Roe v. Wade.	Yes
39085	I had tax cuts for 15 million working Americans, but the Republicans shut down the government to force me to accept their proposal.	Yes
25251	And let's talk about people we do control.	No
4340	That's going to be critical.	No
16250	I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	No
38713	They delegated the task to Afghan warlords, who had been fighting against us only a week before and were not trusted.	Yes
20868	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	No
39162	The trade deficit we faced in the previous year was close to $800 billion.	Yes
11822	One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	No
26227	We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	Yes
34768	Since my presidency, we've been able to increase the number of manufacturing jobs.	Yes
21225	There is a huge difference of opinion.	No
39198	I'll promise you, however, that this is the highest level of private home ownership ever.	Yes
37471	I have maintained my position on SDI and it has remained unchanged.	Yes
2093	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	Yes

15152	Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	Yes
8697	And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	Yes
36837	"A few weeks ago, Mr. Levi, the attorney general of the accused group, proposed a gun control plan that was later supported by Mr."" Ford stated that it would prohibit the sale of Saturday Night Specials."	Yes
38404	We've raised the Pell Grants by one million students.	Yes

17906	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	No
7773	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	Yes
39080	About 100 billion to a quarter of that amount is the result of government action.	Yes
37519	I have provided complete financial support for the land and water conservation program, and in fact, I proposed and the Congress approved a significantly expanded land/water conservation initiative.	Yes
27916	That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	No
29214	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	No

39093	Thousands of refugees have been brought into our country.	Yes
3765	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	Yes
36751	Since the beginning of my campaign, I have been advocating for criminal justice reform.	Yes
27654	And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	No

14369	I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	No
22787	Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	No
32306	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	Yes
26477	We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	Yes
8883	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	No
28801	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	Yes

613	We're going to have to-the MX.	No
36180	The system's initial cost is around $54 billion, but when factoring in the additional costs such as construction, missiles, and personnel, it exceeds $100 billion over its lifetime.	Yes

38248	It was done by all 50 states.	Yes
37385	The majority of them will not receive any real basic assistance until the next president's four-year term is over.	Yes

19523	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	Yes
1505	I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	No
8727	I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	No
542	But here's the point he misses.	No
39275	According to the president, there was an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.	Yes
975	We live-we bring everybody along.	No
25432	But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	No
8949	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	Yes
21655	Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	No
557	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	No
23326	It's been there for 20 years.	No
12258	I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	No
26174	Of course the president will take credit for that.	No
39002	He opposed regulatory reform that resulted in an annual cost of 6 to $7,000 for the average family.	Yes
29620	And it's really a shame.	No
35812	They withdrew after Sergio de Mello's death.	Yes
2915	And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	No
12622	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	No
285	I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	No
22968	I'm going to change that.	No
29562	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	No
13518	Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	Yes
34825	However, she does not indicate that President Obama has deported millions of people in this manner.	Yes
38182	The number of Americans who have died from AIDS is in excess of 150,000.	Yes
18697	Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	No
18455	My opponent just said something amazing.	No
25462	And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	Yes
15967	It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	Yes
36393	Hence, I have never proposed the possibility of being able to fully or significantly pay off the debt in approximately two decades.	Yes
3191	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	No
18215	And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	No
4053	A testimony to you, Jim.	No
1369	I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	No
32166	But we've got to get costs down.	No
206	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	Yes
33833	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	Yes
29781	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	Yes
22183	We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	No
36337	The inspectors were being deceived by him.	Yes
38035	I'm not a fan of liberals, but your record in Arkansas is the most significant tax increase ever recorded.	Yes
37144	Convince oneself that Arkansas is terribly inadequate in terms of its surroundings and support for law enforcement.	Yes
35297	According to a study conducted by Princeton University, the American cities' current status is not as good as it was in 1960.	Yes
20439	I commend you for supporting that.	No
11942	I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	No
38089	The health care plan that Senator Obama has mandated will be imposed on small businesses who fail to adopt it, even if they can afford it and their sales are exempt from the capital gains tax increase.	Yes
38589	Moreover, the new energy policy is founded on two foundations: the need for sacrifice in conservation and the increasing production of American energy, which is showing impressive progress with more coal than ever before in American history and more oil and gas wells drilled than at any point in time.	Yes
19919	And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	No
28946	We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	Yes
20453	I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	No
21763	We've got to do something about it.	No
35636	You won't see a tax increase for someone earning less than $250,000, which is equivalent to one-quarter of your annual income.	Yes
32377	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	No
16867	I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	Yes
9048	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	No
22240	Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	Yes
36355	Our agreement with NATO would be terminated by that.	Yes
29172	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	No
39215	An astounding $200 billion has been thrown into the mix in Iraq.	Yes
17708	There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	Yes
15066	Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	No
4249	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	No
38359	Donald refused to apologize to the distinguished federal judge born in Indiana, but he maintained that his parents' Mexican heritage made him untrustworthy as a judge.	Yes
25966	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	No
22163	We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	Yes
30442	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	No
23822	This is a movement that came from the people.	No
37750	Voodoo economics was referred to by George Bush, his running mate, and he claimed that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	Yes
35506	Alf Landon was against Social Security and President Nixon warned that John Kennedy's proposals would cause the country to go bankrupt, doubling its cost.	Yes
36077	It's intriguing to me that we will be in debt by $50 million more within an hour and a half of being here tonight.	Yes
13868	We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	No
297	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	No
32772	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	No
38973	This country's recession resulted in a deficit.	Yes
36371	The conclusion of the Iraq-Iraq war in 1988 revealed that Saddam Hussein was a despot and we dealt with him because of his opposition to Iran, which could be my friend.	Yes
35259	With a budget ceiling of 395 billion dollars, I put forward 'a proposal to Congress that would have allowed us to cut $25 billion in taxes.	Yes
34647	To ensure that manufacturing jobs are brought back to our shore, I've put in place a strategy that rewards companies and small businesses that are investing in our country.	Yes
36980	He suffocated and engaged in a Twitter feud after the Mexican president claimed that we were not contributing to the construction of the wall.	Yes
29586	That was more than a mistake.	No
25807	In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	No
36156	The fact is that our trade imbalance with China is much greater than it is with us, and it's only going to get worse every year.	Yes
9421	It's critical to our future.	No
2393	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	No
36254	It's true that this is a worldwide initiative.	Yes
2885	Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	No
39366	Keep in mind that I and the Americans were responsible for establishing an international coalition that enabled us to free a country that had been oppressed by dictatorship for 40 years, without spending more on military personnel than we did in Iraq.	Yes
36207	The moment I stepped into the Oval Office, I was met with a welcome reception of over trillion dollars in deficit.	Yes
1050	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	Yes
37248	We've given away entire industries.	Yes
230	But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	No
34243	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	No
17745	I'm going to give the President some credit.	No
8197	We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	Yes
24377	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	Yes
20771	Let me give you one example.	No
2201	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	Yes
30081	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	Yes
8125	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	Yes
20412	Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	No
28967	You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	Yes
21346	Our competitors don't do that.	No
30265	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	No
22732	I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	No
34018	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	No
39405	Nonetheless, the federal treasury is not exempt from paying any more.	Yes
17758	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	No
1071	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	No
37515	As you already noted in our previous comments, the United States of America has the most expensive education in the world, and it also requires reform.	Yes
36297	I - I achieved this by cutting down enormously many workers in specific areas.	Yes
153	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	No
653	Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	No
34975	One of McCain's advisers, Henry Kissinger, and five recent secretaries of state announced that there would be no preconditions for meeting with Iran.	Yes
10339	I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	No
19207	We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	Yes
38872	Eleven votes were required for the House to pass it, resulting in its failure.	Yes
23628	And I truly respect it.	No
11772	It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	No
36805	As previously, we came to a consensus on imposing twenty-four hours limit for us to use as the launchers of ballistic missiles.	Yes
36626	I've maintained a consistent record since 1965.	Yes
20740	I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	No
21326	And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	Yes
28121	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	No
2918	But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	No
7603	Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	No
36490	The President of the United States has stated that they are not part of this treaty.	Yes
1118	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	No
36846	Russia's actions towards Assad and Iran, which resulted in the most foolish deal in history, were enough to fill this room with money.	Yes
17817	Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	Yes
39032	The proportion of his population that has been held accountable is 75%.	Yes
8084	It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	No
38358	Despite never making an apology to the distinguished federal judge born in Indiana, Donald asserted that his parents' Mexican heritage made him untrustworthy as a judge.	Yes
12742	Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	No
19738	The Mideast is very difficult.	No
34702	My campaign has no PAC funding.	Yes
20573	He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	No
4217	It had everything to do with energy.	No
34151	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	Yes
16923	That, I think, is a good balance.	No
25948	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	No
9275	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	No
28262	I strongly believe in local control of schools.	No
38301	The increase of 3 percent this year isn't enough to make it a success.	Yes
19599	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	No
34930	The President exercised his American authority in Lebanon, but the way he managed it resulted in the deaths of marines, humiliation, stronger Soviet forces, and increased motivation towards terrorists.	Yes
30020	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	Yes
2459	But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	No
39461	That's where the tax reductions went exactly.	Yes
35231	I am advocating for a tax cut that would benefit 95 percent of Americans.	Yes
23111	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	Yes
13710	4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	Yes
19218	It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	No
14258	That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	No
24704	When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	No
39277	An $800 billion shortfall belonged to us.	Yes
39267	Although he advises against it, the policies outlined suggest that M.F.N. should be subject to certain conditions.	Yes
39000	According to Mr. Benson, there are twenty-five million Americans who use beans instead of meat in the United States, and it is impossible to determine if they are adequately fed or not.	Yes
25181	"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"	No
15394	Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	No
18205	There's a lot of good people working hard.	No
39220	We emerged victorious in the Kosovo conflict without any casualties, including those of the United States.	Yes
34713	Tax increases are detrimental to the growth rate.	Yes
15758	But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	No
5945	That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	No
36175	Women are no longer required to pay a higher fee for health insurance compared to men before the Affordable Care Act was put in place.	Yes
2648	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	Yes
30369	You asked me a question.	No
28526	But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	No
5807	Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	No
17277	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	No
37255	Alternatively, just 1 percent of the wealthiest individuals in our nation receive 25 percent from all tax reductions.	Yes
35449	You haven't accomplished it in 30 years, 26 years or any other number you desire to...	Yes
39413	The amendment proposed by President Reagan would make abortion a crime if raped, or cause an incestuous woman to die.	Yes
24995	And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	Yes
16926	And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	No
36288	He has declared that he will replace Obamacare and make sure that all the positive aspects of it are included, leaving you to worry.	Yes
845	So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	No
38565	You are aware that my proposal was to lower the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	Yes
9050	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	No
13317	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	No
27678	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	No
6255	Of course, we have to come together.	No
12081	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	No
24323	And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	No
6906	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	Yes
34962	In the eight years before I became President, this country experienced a decline in its own military strength.	Yes
19143	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	No
12799	I hope we can succeed.	No
35651	In the first half of 1984, there has been an 81/2 percent increase.	Yes
15248	We have the sources here.	No
34065	This is how Donald thinks.	No
11705	And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	No
16944	I would have uh - done it opposite.	No
36327	Over the course of almost eight years, he has doubled it in seven-and-a-half years to some extent.	Yes
28443	Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	No
37651	Due to our low cost of energy, the abundant energy is already refueling.	Yes
27797	But I've made a different bet on American workers.	No
37087	Therefore, I have suggested a specific approach to reduce the $4 trillion deficit.	Yes
840	And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	No
2074	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	No
18552	Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	No
20514	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	No
29887	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	No
6401	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	No
36955	When I made the decision to halt all trade with Iran due to the capture of our hostages, I declared that if the hostage-taker is released without harm, we would deliver the Iranian assets they own and release them from captivity.	Yes
25325	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	No
708	We're not making those choices.	No
24099	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	Yes
1440	Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	Yes
28901	I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	No
13920	Everybody says it'll create jobs.	No
37908	The proposal put forth by you and Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred million dollars, but in New York, Mr Rockefeller declined the offer and stated that he did not support the funding, preferring it to be placed on Social Security.	Yes
20517	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	No
15608	(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	No
18138	And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	No
22811	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	No
58	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	No
3944	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	Yes
823	Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.Ã¢â€°Â¤	Yes
36004	Since the Great Depression, Mr. Ford's administration has recorded the highest unemployment rate in our nation.	Yes
29795	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	No
8247	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	No
20071	I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	No
743	As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	Yes
14915	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
38742	The Sinai II agreement was a result of the United States' collaborative efforts with Israel and Egypt, and I am confident that no Israeli or Egyptian soldiers have died since signing the treaty.	Yes
17518	Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	No
35493	Presently, there are 35 States that have task forces working on their educational issues, with no involvement from the Federal Government except for school districts.	Yes
6498	"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	No
38900	BAC, US Air, KLM, and Northwest are all part of the president's campaign. Whom is this guy from Northwest?	Yes
24103	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	No
9661	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	No
15922	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	No
2728	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	No
35604	Even though he promised to reduce state Government spending, it increased from $4.6 billion in 1967 to $10.2 billion during his eight-year term.	Yes
34580	Billions of dollars in lost revenue are likely to be regained by insurance companies due to the repeal, even though they are not improving the health of seniors.	Yes
35976	He declared that he would initiate military operations in Pakistan.	Yes
11309	If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	No
34885	The program I proposed was unsuccessful in the US Senate, as it would have required medical assistance for the elderly to be covered by Social Security and funded by the Social Insurance Corporation.	Yes
4001	That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	No
17529	And I don't agree with it.	No
35582	There have been a few cases where the Burger Court has issued technical rulings that led to an evidently guilty person being found guilty.	Yes
21618	Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	No
20317	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	No
22040	To get the interest rates down.	No
34568	The vice president's opposition to the universal health care system in my state is a misguided one.	Yes
37552	Since Mr. Nixon's presidency in the late 1960s, there has been a decrease in corporate tax payments from 30 percent to around 20 percent.	Yes
22955	This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	No
13452	I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	No
38243	Right now they are plotting to kill Americans.	Yes
10760	That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	No
15757	I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	No
38513	The Simpson-Mazzoli bill and the Senate's enactment were both strongly endorsed, Georgie Anne.	Yes
18594	The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	No
32831	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	No
10350	I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	Yes
28102	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	No
14032	And it goes on and on.	No
16893	They have too many employees.	No
36354	That would be a deviation from our agreement with NATO.	Yes
15172	You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	No
38746	The government incurs an annual expense of $1.4 billion due to this.	Yes
25956	And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	Yes
22928	Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	No
35563	A letter from 38 Democratic senators to the president declared that the tensions with Israel were a genuine issue.	Yes

25684	I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	No
13137	This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	No
23439	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	No
6901	If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	No

18111	The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	No
33716	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	Yes
32153	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	No
12189	Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	Yes
14988	"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."""	No
30009	And I'm very proud of it.	No
30198	I know how to win.	No
13871	That's one of the things I want to change.	No
18286	Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	No
950	And then it gets down to a question of values.	No
12332	And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	No
8690	We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	Yes
13963	You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	Yes
16710	When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	Yes
36052	The Congress's special session, chaired by Mr. Kennedy, rejected both that and the government contracts provision.	Yes
20874	Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	No
29559	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	No
24607	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	Yes
36541	That was not his stance on Tibet.	Yes
3654	You've got to look at our records.	No
32446	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	Yes
3131	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	Yes
23249	He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	No
34958	The Wall Street Journal's front page informed me that NATO is establishing a significant terror unit four months ago.	Yes
7235	And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	No
36488	You brought up the Navy, highlighting that we now have a smaller fleet than in 1916.	Yes
39062	Hillary Clinton is advocating for a 550 percent increase in the tax rate to replace Obama.	Yes
26821	What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.	No
36747	Washington's unwillingness to address the challenging issues for decades and the policies implemented over the past eight years have resulted in a severe economic crisis, the most severe since the Great Depression.	Yes
38069	Regrettably, he fled while in the Tora Bora mountains.	Yes
39338	With my budget, I aim to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and support local school districts in constructing new schools.	Yes
19491	So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	No
36459	We decreased more regulations and terminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	Yes
32650	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	No
3325	Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	No
24374	We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	Yes
36966	Our people in Libya were killed in an attack apparently carried out by terrorists, and we are aware of this.	Yes
24604	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	Yes
39298	The 28 nations that make up NATO are frequently undercharging themselves for their dues.	Yes
38633	My opinion is that incentive should be provided to both the individual and the business and industry sectors, and I believe my plan, which has received extensive support and approval from several leading economists in the nation, is based on projected outcomes.	Yes
35868	A tax break will be given to those with middle-class income.	Yes
39056	Recently, an Air Force General in Europe stated that we will soon be faced with airplanes without engines and tank commanders who cannot drive their tanks beyond three-quarters of a mile due to dwindling fuel supplies.	Yes
13761	But I don't think it's fair.	No
27646	We then started to build up Afghan forces.	No
35787	A solar company was purchased by our nation.	Yes
13321	Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	No
29622	Our country has tremendous problems.	No
2564	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	No
13296	I would disagree with it.	No
20424	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	No
37904	I have a preference for green energy, but it only covers roughly 50 years of oil and gas.	Yes
37357	In 1974, there was an oil shock that raised the price of OPEC oil to an unprecedented level.	Yes
17534	It's been a big failure.	No
3773	We have to obviously cut spending.	No
36199	His votes resulted in the raising of taxes 98 times and the defeat of the budget 277 times.	Yes
729	We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	No
18821	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	Yes
10708	I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	Yes
16446	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	No
4163	"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	No
37535	The Panama Canal negotiations were initiated by President Johnson and have persisted until now.	Yes
23139	There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	No
33471	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	Yes
17216	Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	No
25622	We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	No
37727	Taking a moment to trust Mr. Bush's word, we have no proof that our government had informed Saddam Hussein about the possibility of him owning some part of Kuwait.	Yes
22338	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	No
36584	Take a look at the 24 retired generals and admirals who have shown their support, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	Yes
16087	I think I've addressed it.	No
7461	And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	No
3498	But there's also the issue of responsibility.	No
25094	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	No
4149	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	No
37018	Instead, it's gone up by that much.	Yes
35517	We'll take a trillion dollars from you and invest under safe investment rules to maximize your return, rather than the conservative 2% rate.	Yes
36129	The Soviet sphere of influence has seen the ascent of two countries, Guinea and Ghana, and Cuba, in terms of foreign policy.	Yes
37659	We have come to realize that the countries we supported in Europe and Japan in the Far East, along with some of our former enemies, have made a complete recovery.	Yes
14148	He got a notice or he didn't.	No
34694	The president granted it to the richest Americans in a tax exemption.	Yes
35330	Our schools were ranked as the top in the nation, which meant that all our children would have a bright future.	Yes
24946	And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	Yes
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
12752	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	Yes
26642	We took it out of politics.	No
18575	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	Yes
17175	No one else believes that's the case.	No
12453	I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	Yes
12326	It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	Yes
7017	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	No
21171	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	No
2241	One last point I want to make.	No
36766	Despite the fact that certain issues are not favorable to us in terms of democracy, what is an alternative solution?	Yes
38908	The middle class families are being pushed to the limit by that.	Yes
6950	Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	No
841	And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	No
23637	I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	No
17180	Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	Yes

35197	During his encouragement of the president to enter Iraq, Senator McCain proposed that it would be a speedy and effortless process, and we would all be welcomed as liberators.	Yes
34514	Our agreement with Latin America, which included the establishment of the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, is one of five treaties that we have committed to not intervening in the internal affairs of any other American country, and they have also agreed to do the same.	Yes
10505	Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	No
588	And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	No
17524	There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	Yes
13621	And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	No
15517	He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	Yes
26750	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	No
37378	Despite this, he denounces my vetoes, which have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and potentially another $13 billion.	Yes
35444	A $2,500 increase in health insurance premiums has been observed.	Yes
25828	But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	No
16670	We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	No
16580	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	No
2964	Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	Yes
14703	They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.	No
8327	Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	No
35491	The Kurdish people were actively engaged in negotiating and attempting to resolve their differences during the Bush administration.	Yes

34649	The sale of their assets into us results in no tax being paid.	Yes
15934	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	No
27581	I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	Yes
34688	The people are the ones who have to take care of that, right?	Yes
22120	The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.

3879	And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	No
37371	The numbers that the President has just employed in relation to California are a misrepresentation of the situation, as my tenure as Governor of California resulted in fewer per capita spending increases relative to those achieved during Mr. Carter's tenure at Georgia.	Yes
8915	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	Yes
261	He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	Yes

22060	That is priority one in this country.	No
36423	You voted to cut services for 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
28760	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	No
16371	That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	No
25352	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	No
36550	Six other studies have analyzed the study you describe and concluded that it is entirely incorrect.	Yes
34858	The State of California was once plagued by a brutal beating by an unnamed man, resulting in the death of their child and causing her life to be fatal. The state's legislature passed legislation mandating that any person who abuses maternity leave can be charged with murder.	Yes
22558	I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	No
18593	That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	No
20320	And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	No
16407	And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	No
16844	Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	Yes
12650	Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	No
37676	Our approach is comparable to that of the Trump Foundation, which obtained a six-foot portrait of Donald by using stolen funds.	Yes
33037	I will bring our energy companies back.	No
5797	But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	No
11066	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	No
34533	The administration of President Carter reduced the military build-up by 38%, delayed the development of cruise missiles, and planned a mobile military force that could be transported to various parts of the world.	Yes
923	In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	No
19950	It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	Yes

35566	The federal contribution to water treatment plants has been raised by more than 60 percent under my leadership as president.	Yes
31871	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	Yes
1536	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	No

4025	I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.	No
35014	Four out of the five George Bush budgets were chosen by Senator McCain in his vote.	Yes
15867	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	No
7112	He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	No
37580	The Republican majority bill is being opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies.	Yes
32235	You're going to have plans...	No
30109	They were choking on the sanctions.	No
37674	The new law will result in a tax increase for nine million individuals and also require greater reductions in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and environmental protection than the ones that were vetoed by myself and Mr. Gingrich in the previous year.	Yes
3097	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	Yes
37468	You did not acknowledge the Administration's plan to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw from the islands over the past five years.	Yes

37008	The voting population is composed of fewer parents of school-age children than in previous elections, and the largest group of students has been recorded.	Yes
34535	My initial proposal during my administration was to completely eliminate intermediate-range missiles, which the Soviets had a 10 or even fewer chance of winning than the allies in Europe.	Yes
5566	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	No
13204	I completely sustained the treaty.	Yes
13252	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	Yes
16253	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	No
25788	Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	No
32891	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	No
27627	So our troops will come home at that point.	Yes
13270	U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	No
16947	I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	No
3526	We haven't been paying attention to them.	No
11401	Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.	No
38497	The Congress, Foreign Relations, and Senate Intelligence Committees have never been given access to them.	Yes
16132	It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	No
17033	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	No
23085	That's what leadership is all about.	No
18906	The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	Yes
19117	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	No
29012	One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	No
8473	And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	Yes
35670	The period since I became president has seen 44 countries transition to democracy, without the use of dictatorships or communist regimes.	Yes
23590	So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	No
35261	The revenues surpass Social Security expenses until 2015, ensuring that all retirees receive the assurances.	Yes
1378	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	Yes

12475	This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	No
34515	The Organization of American States was established in Bogota in 1948, and we have made five treaties with Latin America, in which we pledged to not interfere in the internal affairs of any other American country. They also agreed to do the same.	Yes

36054	Their population includes 4 million children who are citizens of the United States and 15 million individuals.	Yes
36146	The amount of money he allocates for tax cuts to the wealthiest 1% is greater than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
4377	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	No
37288	Under the tax code, if you are a single mother with two children and earn $22,000 annually, your marginal rate will be higher than that of someone earning over $200,000 per year.	Yes
34984	The outcome has not been disclosed, including whether it will be deemed addictive.	Yes

26015	Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	No
17652	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	Yes
5507	We ought to put the homeowners first.	No
36427	Upon my election as president, the White House staff consisted of approximately five hundred employees.	Yes
8039	It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	No
12643	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	Yes
33	And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	No
11713	Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	No
31862	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	Yes
16711	Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	Yes
19696	We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	No
12526	And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	Yes
25307	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	No
37645	Due to the will, determination, and toughness, we now face ancient adversaries who are discussing peace in the Middle East.	Yes
28487	Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	No
3424	I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	No
22217	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	No
37930	The initial President to step down from office under pressure was among thirty-eight.	Yes
6086	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	Yes
37161	It's worth remembering that Social Security income exceeds its costs until 2015.	Yes
11331	Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	No
19215	I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	No
35724	The rate of poverty has increased, but it is not as high as it was in the previous years.	Yes
19381	So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	No
2903	So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	No
30062	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	No
35004	The House of Representatives has been under the control of a single party for 38 years, leading to pathetic post offices and bank overdrafts.	Yes
38210	The National Park Service will receive additional funding in the current year's budget.	Yes
33361	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	Yes
2967	(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	No
38816	The year 1979 saw us incurring a $29 billion deficit.	Yes
37443	The so-called negotiation you said I walked away from was the so called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one (US) of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me who rejected it; the USSR just disavowed it.	Yes
16499	Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.	Yes
22820	The military's job is to win the war.	No
158	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	No
35427	His stance has been that he was indifferent towards the possibility of other nations acquiring nuclear weapons, including Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.	Yes
21629	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	Yes
15373	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	No
29925	He should have produced it a long time before.	No
38068	Unluckily, he broke free in the Tora Bora mountains.	Yes
20871	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	No
37299	General Petraeus has commended the successes, but he believes that they are fragile and would have been lost if we had set a specific date for withdrawal. This was in contrast to Senator Obama's original plan where the surge would not have succeeded until last spring.	Yes
24210	I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	Yes
855	No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	No
16827	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	No
8722	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	Yes
39222	If Germany can keep costs low and provide healthcare services to all, Hawaii can afford health care for 98% of its population at a lower cost than the rest of the world, and Rochester, New York can cover two-thirds of that expense, I believe America can do the same.	Yes
38933	As a result, the majority of tax reductions are directed towards low-income earners, who receive one-fifth of the benefits.	Yes
17130	Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	No
19700	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	Yes
17606	I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	Yes
27642	And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	No
19325	The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	No
28809	So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	No
35319	The amount we are obligated to pay is slightly more than $1 billion every year.	Yes
35342	There are 11 million people who lack documentation in our country.	Yes
37973	Their combined income is $51,000, and they pay approximately $3500 in taxes.	Yes
36849	Our employees were able to receive better mental health care by adding more staff members.	Yes
2873	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	Yes
3753	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	Yes
11363	I believe in its greatness.	No
14084	We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	Yes
37711	Terrorist acts were initiated, but the building's suicide bombing resulted in their fatalities.	Yes
9708	Our party has been focused too long.	No
17480	I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	No
15321	I'd like to change that.	No
33371	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	No
37697	We, as the president, financed an Iron Dome initiative to put a stop to the missile attacks.	Yes
27527	And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	Yes
39360	I am confident in my decision to take over California, which holds 10% of the population and would be the seventh most dominant economic state globally if it were a state.	Yes
20647	Morale in today's military is too low.	No
36970	I am not fiscally irresponsible and must choose to cancel the tax cut that the president is so determined to defend, which benefits me, my family, and Charlie.	Yes
10829	There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	No
612	And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	No
36999	He made a commitment to build this alliance with the United States, as we are aware.	Yes
22430	I hope I'm that person.	No
8978	And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	Yes
39449	While you were concentrating on Iraq, you suggested that Afghanistan could be managed through negotiation.	Yes
5826	We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	No
161	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	Yes
34896	The current deficit amounts to $2.6 trillion.	Yes
17378	I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	No
10349	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	Yes
32165	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	No
34771	Controlling spending was our strategy in that particular case.	Yes
22129	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	No
35900	Despite Massachusetts having a small defense budget, the governor raised taxes five times.	Yes
36276	Today's announcement revealed that we've experienced a rise of 1.9 million new jobs in the past 13 months.	Yes
36143	I won't take the $29 million from his state pension fund, which is equivalent to withdrawing from the Social Security trust fund at the federal level.	Yes
29500	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	No
39233	Our monthly expenditure in Iraq is $10 billion, despite having a surplus of $79 billion.	Yes
35399	In New Jersey, the president made it clear that he would not increase taxes, but Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesperson, stated within a day that this was untrue.	Yes
22272	It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	No
12641	There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	Yes
35122	The largest deficit ever in our country's history was caused by a $65 billion deficit last year, which was more than what we had during the eight-year period of President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
21857	I think it's a good program.	No
38223	According to a former HEW secretary under Mr. Carter, there was $7 billion of fraud and waste in welfare and medical programs associated with it.	Yes
36324	The reason they favor it is that it doesn't meet the requirements for remitting decisions to doctors and nurses, providing access to emergency room services without an HMO, or necessitating calling 911, and having bipartisan support.	Yes
18068	My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	Yes
36308	The trillion-dollar debt we're adding every year is not moral.	Yes
11802	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	No
39488	The return of money to the people and reduction in Government spending resulted in California's inflation being lower than the national average.	Yes
3379	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	No
29286	You can't bring back jobs.	No
24625	We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	No
38514	The score is 121/4, and I anticipate it to drop slightly in the coming days.	Yes
38266	Our economy has been weakened by this.	Yes
7498	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	No
34805	This is by far the most significant amount in American history, not just the major ones mentioned, but also many other minor ones.	Yes
34414	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	No
20131	I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	No
25142	I could have gone on forever.	No
12856	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	No
27539	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
22627	That's why he called him a grave threat.	No
37605	Nearly every single one of her donors, including Buffett, Soros, and George Sorez, stole hundreds of millions of dollars.	Yes
29740	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	Yes
21495	Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	No
38982	He has been accused of being a war criminal.	Yes
1512	Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	No
20823	Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	No
38052	We have no interest in involving the military in that area.	Yes
29408	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	No
16664	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	Yes
2174	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	Yes
36998	It is known that he committed to building a coalition for the United States.	Yes
18451	We need to deny them the safe havens.	No
2900	And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	Yes
7672	He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.	No
35006	Several other data points indicate that the grant schemes are more extensive than ever, serving to support more individuals than before.	Yes
8524	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	No
9010	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	No
37069	I believe that ignoring the Federal Government's responsibility to address our failing cities is a violation of the right for 55% of black people in metropolitan areas to have access to solutions.	Yes
30312	It is essential that America's word be good.	No
5793	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	No
36745	The National Education Association was honored for sending delegates to the Democratic convention, giving 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, while teachers were choosing to send their children to private schools or higher public schools.	Yes
36108	We are the ones lowering the barrier to products through Carla Hill's negotiation.	Yes
37238	The deficit has been underestimated by billions of dollars despite previous estimates by the administration.	Yes
9195	But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	Yes
1938	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	No
35475	The vast majority of people in this country are dependent on public assistance.	Yes
38382	AIDS has received more funding from us.	Yes
618	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	No
36564	We have experienced a significant surge in our exports.	Yes
24098	We've got to invest and grow.	No
36378	Our expenditure on education is not meeting our objectives, and we're spending more money per child.	Yes
37703	President Clinton's actions led to his impeachment and loss of his legal license.	Yes
11645	We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	Yes
365	And I think the housing community is ready.	No
25595	I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	No
2734	I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.	No
21934	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	No
38913	After the end of this year, we'll settle it like we did with Social Security in 83.	Yes
38190	The country's lowest state and local spending per capita is ours.	Yes
36773	The most significant failure in the history of small businesses has been achieved.	Yes
3643	It is not a good deal for the American people.	No
14736	Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	No
36524	The Nobel laureate in South Africa stated that the government is seen as working alongside its oppressive regime, just two days ago.	Yes
22116	And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	No
3551	I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	Yes
35597	Sales taxes, income tax, and property tax were not raised.	Yes
38555	These tales have been largely discredited, to say the least.	Yes
34619	In the past 5 years, our income has increased at a rate that exceeded the national average.	Yes
26261	I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	No
38613	There has been an extraordinary rise in the number of bankruptcies.	Yes
36534	The fact that black and Hispanic youth in cities are experiencing 55% youth unemployment is a significant concern.	Yes
37687	His denial of his involvement in the war in Iraq is only repeated on a 10- or 12-time basis.	Yes
1581	And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	Yes
15812	Probably never heard of him.	No
13878	That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	No
36131	Several times, he has raised taxes.	Yes
37958	They'll have a minimum of two options.	Yes
7157	It's to make sure we raise standards.	No
27526	This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	No
1720	So all of this is possible.	No
37333	168 federal programs have the authority to grant quotas.	Yes
20635	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	No
8665	I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	Yes
34709	My opposition to subsidies for ethanol was due to my belief that they would distort the market and cause inflation, but Senator Obama stood by them.	Yes
17751	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	No
25585	I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	No
12298	I think there's a difference.	No
34573	Our debt is the most significant threat to national security, as stated by Admiral Mullen, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.	Yes
31978	I'm not proud of it.	No
38777	Three thousand American lives were lost.	Yes
6921	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	No
38564	As you know, I suggested a cut to the number of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to one thousand.	Yes
18464	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	No
19419	I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	No
8503	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	Yes
24685	Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	No
18765	I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	No
244	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	No
17428	But I finally did it.	No
15983	I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	No
13266	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	Yes
35117	In seven of the eight years, defense budgets saw a 37% reduction.	Yes
35164	In the event that you earn over $25,000 annually and receive no assistance from the Bush prescription drug proposal for four to five years, you may be required to switch to a Medicare or insurance company plan, which does not have any restrictions on premiums, deductibles.	Yes
13429	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	No
17690	One final point if I might.	No
26405	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	No
24854	What we need to do is empower people.	No
36725	There is a lot of talk about the possibility of having trigger locks on guns for sale in the future.	Yes
10562	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	No
6860	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	Yes
32855	To go back to the very, very first question.	No
17787	I told you never would I do such a thing.	No
36741	The purpose of this action is to transfer troops from Korea and replace them with more potent weaponry.	Yes
26667	Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	No
38596	The energy crisis in the United States is a result of the government's removal of land from Alaska, which is believed by geologists to contain valuable minerals and energy sources.	Yes
25073	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	No
31963	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	No
17421	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	No
12627	Is our strength and prestige rising?	No
22270	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	No
35615	I was a senator for eight years, and my name is on four hundred pieces of legislation that I sponsored or cosponsered.	Yes
39399	These were being categorized as A1 high-quality investments by credit agencies, but they were not.	Yes
35162	The economy has been negatively impacted by the excessive regulation of legislation during the president's term.	Yes
5617	And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	Yes
22092	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	No
15008	And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	No
34460	A large number of public schools are meeting the demand.	Yes
21401	We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	Yes
30229	No, they were taunting us.	No
34278	This would take a lot of negotiation.	No
35796	The tax deductions made by her donors were colossal.	Yes
14941	But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	No
35958	Her e-mails, which were destroyed criminally after being subpoenaed by the United States Congress, are not fictionalized in any way.	Yes
24436	But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	No
28614	We need to open up markets.	No
12560	Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.	No
32182	In '17, it implodes by itself.	Yes
37505	Despite not being aware of the truth, Senator Obama's tax increases will lead to an increase in taxes on 50 percent of small business income.	Yes
35375	President Obama was left with what has been the worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression.	Yes
35888	It's our duty to do both, and my plan is for that.	Yes
12525	In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	Yes
39477	It will result in the creation of bubble jobs.	Yes
21473	But that's what I feel.	No
29658	I built an unbelievable company.	No
36066	The bill that passed the Congress and signed by the President would result in a billion dollars spent on the Treasury's funds, as per my proposal.	Yes
3828	But we have to use our military wisely.	No
8075	They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	No
21594	Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	No
1190	Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	No
30303	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	No
3638	Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	No
35842	The administration should not be held accountable for the strained relationship with Pakistan, as I don't.	Yes
35459	Take a look at Sarah Brady, the wife of Jim Brady and President Reagan's press secretary, who supported me because he refused to defend the Brady Bill while subduing the NRA.	Yes
15991	The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	No
7259	That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	No
38257	Senator Kennedy quotes the record from a recent read and fails to emphasize that the crucial vote, which he was in the minority on, rejected his position.	Yes

36825	Despite the numbers, he still spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new prescription drug and healthcare initiatives, as well as education and national defense.	Yes
20040	And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	No

35684	He ends this term with no progress in arms control, but instead, a dangerous arms race is taking place.	Yes
29954	I don't think you can deny that.	No
38135	In relation to Libya, as I stated in the previous debate, I made sure that we did everything possible to safeguard Americans who were still in danger, followed by conducting a thorough investigation of the incident, and ultimately prosecuting those responsible for American deaths.	Yes
18770	And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	No
37092	Al Qaida and the Taliban have established safe havens in northwest Pakistan, but despite providing them with $10 billion under George Bush and Senator McCain's leadership, they have not been eradicated.	Yes
38620	I gave the interview to Playboy and subsequently conducted interviews with Governor Jerry Brown, Walter Cronkite, Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Simon, William Buckley, and many others.	Yes
28816	Well, you establish respect for differences.	No
12138	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	Yes
7393	And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	No

9717	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	No

13902	In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.	Yes
7846	I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	Yes

21714	I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	No
24593	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.

15936	And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	No
25517	And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	No
3619	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	No
37872	He was not out of the loop as he repeatedly supported it while listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger's opposition.	Yes
13842	But let's take my life in perspective.	No
15971	Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	No

22142	If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	No
8456	Well as you take the bills -	No
2221	I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	No
20625	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	No
28925	And in some cases may be still at large.	No
19558	We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	No
37509	Haiti, where we spend approximately three billion dollars, received an alarm call two weeks ago.	Yes
2235	And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	No

9014	I believe in freedom of choice.	No
14174	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	No

784	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	No

27248	I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	No

35216	Upon arriving in Washington as a governor, I discovered the presence of thirteen federal agencies responsible for managing the drug treatment program for drug addicts.	Yes
25086	As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	No

3078	And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	No
11476	It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	No
24906	A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	No
32286	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	No
35605	Despite his commitment to cut state government spending, I am aware that it increased from $4.6 billion in 1967 to $10.2 billion during his eight-year term.	Yes
36026	Within a year, you granted $90 billion in subsidies to the green energy sector.	Yes
33233	So I'm very honored by all of that.	No
36990	The signing of laws by Congress and the president each year results in increased activity and reduced budgeting.	Yes
17124	And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	No
37267	The worst war in Europe was underway in Bosnia when I became president.	Yes
29528	And in a way, I should be complaining.	No

17720	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	No
315	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	No
26019	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	Yes
7531	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	No
29104	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	No
14704	I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	No
7149	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	No
35046	It is my opinion that an agricultural policy of this administration should not incur the 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars per year that has been incurred over the past three or four years.	Yes
3587	I have fought against it my career.	No
13608	Do I have 1 minute?	No

34464	"It is hard to believe that Mr. Bush is still attempting to make trust a priority after implementing policies like ""reading my lips"" and creating 15 million new jobs, as well as adopting voodoo economics such as export enhancement and traveling around the country with programs he previously opposed."	Yes

35949	The average was approximately 18% during the first quarter of this year.	Yes
36673	My tax cut does not almost negate the $86 billion increase.	Yes
35412	The Black Congressional Caucus has not been represented by this president.	Yes
7096	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	Yes
31904	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	No
26128	So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	Yes
15600	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	No
19412	We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	Yes

34687	It is my opinion that the number of prosecutions has increased by roughly 68 percent.	Yes
12708	Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	No
8529	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	No
1823	There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	Yes

36742	I voted for border security, and there are...	Yes

13325	He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	Yes
28875	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	No
12075	But I feel very strongly about that.	No
34121	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	No
30194	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	No
2145	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	No
39176	The Middle East has been experiencing turmoil and a surge of unrest in recent years, with Al Qaida and other militant groups making sudden appearances.	Yes
521	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	No
24102	I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	No
27809	That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	No
38191	We have the lowest state and local spending per capita in the country.	Yes
35942	In 1980, the individual had dropped $500 from the poverty line.	Yes
35348	I've suggested halting the sale of processing plants to Germany and France for Pakistan and Brazil.	Yes
13770	And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	Yes
32628	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	No
1403	But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	No
16599	This needs to be changed.	No
26915	And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	No
12513	I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	No
17820	And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	No
39349	About $1,700 was donated as tax relief to a family of four with an income of $40,000.	Yes
7187	Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	No

79	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	Yes
36539	Under the presidency, the economy has suffered a loss of 1.6 million jobs.	Yes
683	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	No
3108	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	Yes

23602	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	No
590	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	Yes
24139	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	No
661	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	No
38054	The statement made by Mr. Ford about unemployment was a source of concern for me, as it suggested that the country could only achieve its goals during Johnson and Kennedy's time of war.	Yes

19820	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	No
2576	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	No
39068	The military is facing challenges in various parts of the world.	Yes
30219	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	Yes
18430	First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.	Yes
23980	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	No
38352	It's unfortunate, but the gains have gone up since the Great Recession.	Yes
38474	Both Republicans and Democrats are in agreement that $2.5 trillion should be spent on this.	Yes
29701	So we have to do two things, as I said.	No
26188	And so let me just say this.	No
28471	I've worked on that long and hard.	No
37419	It has been unsuccessful after 12 years of trying.	Yes
35774	The reality is that the bill proposed this morning was not as high as your proposal, Mr. Nixon.	Yes
32739	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	Yes
4111	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	Yes
3297	And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	No
13409	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	No
15329	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	No
16953	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	Yes
12271	But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.	Yes
34229	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	No
38067	Having helped her client off the job, she has been seen laughing at the girl who was raped twice.	Yes
23762	I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	No
34354	In fact, I think just the opposite.	No
14564	Now, I'll tell ya this.	No
36716	The attempt to reduce the production level by lowering the support price was unsuccessful, leading to surpluses worth nine billion dollars.	Yes

37990	The vice president and I have a fundamental contrast in their approach to health care, which is similar to the situation with 37 million working families who lack health insurance.	Yes
34516	The United States has always been on the opposing side, which is why we have remained in that position.	Yes
5551	Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	Yes
19844	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	Yes
29784	We cannot just say law and order.	No
23872	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	No
36693	During my presidency, that was the event that transpired.	Yes
34510	Middle- income Americans have experienced a decrease of $4,300 in their income.	Yes
33229	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	Yes
34667	The bill was found to have gotten into legislative problems, leading to no action being taken.	Yes
8869	Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	Yes
27390	I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	No

17122	We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	Yes
39340	We're raising the percentage from 1 to 4 percent.	Yes
22613	But 9/11 changed it all.	No
22466	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	No
25271	Now we have a runaway arms race.	No
29941	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	Yes

35033	As a result, our universities have become more diverse.	Yes
8260	He was nominated by it.	No
4108	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	No
23174	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	No
7068	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	No
35697	Eisenhower and schools, which had three times the number of classrooms built during the Truman Administration, are now discussed.	Yes
15058	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	No
31989	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	No
12261	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	No
25	We have to change this whole culture.	No
33785	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	No
32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	No
35038	Senator McCain believed that the free enterprise system operates in accordance with the need to continue deregulating.	Yes
39476	Bubble jobs will be created by it.	Yes
35031	It was not a government-held takeover of health care.	Yes
35321	The absence of a comprehensive report on the missing in action from Vietnam means that I will not accept its admission to the United Nations.	Yes
7421	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	No
15435	And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	No
20117	Let's take all these four years in a row.	No
2920	This is a responsibility of the president.	No

38144	The Iron Curtain permeated six hundred million people during the seven-year period before this Administration's arrival in Washington.	Yes
6912	You want to buy into it, you can.	No
7321	They don't reach those goals.	No
15684	The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	No
38520	According to 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates, the economy is negatively impacted by it.	Yes
38641	The 21st century will soon witness the conclusion of trade agreements with Japan, which we are currently pursuing.	Yes
38446	The federal government provides assurances to several banks that are too big to fail.	Yes
37783	We have reduced per capita spending and Government size compared to other states, but only saw a one-twelfth increase in Government sizes during the last eight years.	Yes
17813	This administration seems to run that every morning.	No
37451	From a triple-dip recession in 2008, we've gone from three years with the stock market tripling over the past 12 years.	Yes

34997	Since the Republican Party took office in the 1920s, we have experienced a much faster rate of job growth, with an additional ten and if half million jobs.	Yes
29796	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	No
21203	I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	No
35458	Pay attention to Sarah Brady, the wife of Jim Brady and press secretary for President Reagan, who backed me because of his opposition to the NRA and refusal to back the Brady Bill.	Yes
37528	Under Governor Bush's plan, individuals would receive a fixed income of no money for four to five years before being required to enroll in an HMO or seek insurance from another insurer, with no restrictions on premiums, deductibles and terms.	Yes
9473	Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	No
8587	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	Yes
34447	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	Yes
13477	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	No
13351	But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	No
25428	Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	No
6777	And that's why I support that.	No
13143	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	No
34728	The initial reduction in defense spending was excessive.	Yes
20060	It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	No
21444	And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.	No
39504	There has never been a higher percentage of Americans in the workforce.	Yes

13915	I do understand creating jobs.	No
4247	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	No
4246	That made no sense whatsoever.	No
18234	I believe they want to.	No
19349	That's why we need campaign finance reform.	No
35119	Based on the announcement this week, there is a projected yearly growth of 200,000 homes, which is significantly higher than last year and significantly more than the previous half of the same period.	Yes
34321	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	No
12657	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	No

24931	And he drew up this manual.	No

34971	Following 9/11, the president requested a second tax cut and pledged to create 5.6 million jobs once the recession had ended.	Yes
39471	Did it come to your attention that the number has tripled in the last five years?	Yes
22442	Congress -- they're all good people.	No
38025	In a span of 30 days, 20 countries have witnessed 37 acts of terrorism.	Yes
25387	And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	No

35013	Over the past ten years, the United States has witnessed an increase in its budget of approximately 11 percent per year.	Yes
12364	We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	No
1487	But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	No
11650	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	No
11685	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	No
27956	And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	Yes
24451	I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	No
28196	They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	No
23450	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	No
17853	So far, it is only a beginning.	No
8951	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	Yes
2973	And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	No
32137	It's nice to -- one on three.	No
346	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	No
8576	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	Yes
4158	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	No
15606	And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	Yes
23696	I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	No
39058	These islands are not as valuable as the bones of a single American, according to Admiral Yarnell, the leader of the Asiatic fleet.	Yes
35309	There has been a decrease in growth in comparison to last year, and even more so this year.	Yes
38354	It is my understanding that Governor Carter vetoed thirty-five to forty bills annually while in office as Governor of Georgia.	Yes
22582	That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	No
37041	According to him, medical liability costs increase by 1 percent.	Yes
14627	I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.	No
38292	Our decision to send millions of jobs overseas is atypical given the process of cashing in, working as spokesman for foreign governments, earning $30,000 per month, taking time off work, maintaining good relationships, and returning home.	Yes
1305	And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	No
2815	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	No
38275	My campaign focused on advocating for the notion of taxpayers being able to recover their money if they put it up.	Yes
18956	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	No
10075	That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.	No
945	The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	No
24	We've got to get after the users more.	No
14567	I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	No
4091	We do need tougher sanctions.	No
37449	It consumes a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths of the world's population per year more than our current spending, but it also exceeds the current expenditure by up to eighteen billion dollars annually.	Yes
1461	One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	No
34960	Israel was responsible for 60 percent of the weapons sent to the Middle East during the last Democratic administration.	Yes
14401	So I say this is very simple.	No
15569	So I'm pledged to do that.	No
8843	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	No
36607	$7,700 is the amount that the government pays to each family for this purpose.	Yes
3365	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	No
10051	But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	Yes
36851	The others either retreated or cast doubts on our behalf.	Yes
24075	I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	No
27165	We want a peaceful planet.	No
37362	The highest number ever recorded this year will be achieved next year and for the tenth year in a row.	Yes
27631	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	Yes
16589	And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	Yes
17241	And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	No
34681	The majority of Senator Obama's 94 votes indicate that he will either increase your taxes or oppose tax cuts.	Yes
35992	I backed the endeavor to offer superior guidance to the courts, but John McCain was against it.	Yes
36152	The Senate Armed Services Committee voted against the SALT II treaty by 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, and concluded that it did not meet the United States' national security interests.	Yes
37921	I believe the dividing line is that 5 and a half million people decided to cast their votes for me.	Yes
1059	But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	No
17290	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	No
15904	And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	No
38912	We'll settle it once this year, just like we did with Social Security in 83.	Yes
37230	"The ""Los Angeles Times"" has reported that the budget I've published will result in government spending being a zero percent reduction from GDP, marking the lowest level in 50 years."	Yes
6905	Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	No
28507	If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	No
11249	We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	No
507	And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	No
15382	When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	Yes
28044	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	No
2171	We're going to give a better prescription program.	No
23138	First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	Yes
8155	I think we can do a better job.	No
15417	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	No
11735	That's really about all we can do.	No
36683	As a first point, it should be noted that the board is not in charge of making decisions about treatment options.	Yes
5850	I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	No
35460	Our health care system is the most expensive in the world.	Yes
39246	Almost 30% of it is given to Americans who earn over $1 million annually, as I pointed out.	Yes
2862	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	No
26797	It's not about President Clinton.	No
6793	That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	No
28791	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	No
36687	This has been passed by the House, and there is a good chance it will pass in the Senate.	Yes
23512	We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	No
26942	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	No
3074	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	Yes
11364	It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	No
12191	So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	No
28631	The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	No
18941	Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	No
13127	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	No
8622	That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	No
35590	Due to the president's decision to cut the COPS program, law enforcement officials are being removed from public life.	Yes
35742	The extent of Senator Obama's connection with ACORN, who could be committing serious frauds and jeopardizing the fabric of democracy in this country is something we should not forget.	Yes
17980	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	No
12566	And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	No
18305	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	No
6932	I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	No
13128	That is the present American position.	No
8066	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	No
36948	The current workforce represents a higher percentage of Americans than any other time in history.	Yes
17535	I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	Yes
37796	Our national debt has doubled under President Obama's administration.	Yes
11037	And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	No
15165	unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	No
38790	As a presidential candidate, I would have had no impact on Captain Khan's life in Iraq, as he is considered an American hero.	Yes
6055	If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	No
6923	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	No
34865	The majority of our jobs are held by small businesses, accounting for two-thirds.	Yes
36102	If the majority of middle-class individuals were accurate, the tax cuts offered to them would be lower than the one provided to the wealthiest 1% under his proposal.	Yes
25323	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	No
1609	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	No
37685	He asserts that he will cover the expenses by closing loopholes and deductions.	Yes
38849	To assist low-income Americans, we established a 10 percent bracket.	Yes
13155	We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	No
39270	His intention is to spend a significant amount of money on various weapon systems. He is against new taxes, but has broken his pledge in the past year to provide the richest taxpayers with earmarks of $40 billion over five years.	Yes
24415	Use--work internationally to do it.	No
13224	Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	No
34651	During my campaign in North Pittsburgh, I observed that the water mains in the city had started to leak and there was no money available.	Yes
17143	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	Yes
11359	I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	No
13170	Yes, we should make a great effort.	No
33655	... that's offshore back into the country.	No
34207	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	No
33823	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	No
12642	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	Yes
37900	The prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, has been convinced by him that the time had come to address Rhodesia's problems, which he has done exceptionally well in.	Yes
12668	We want freedom to gain.	No
27396	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	No
3261	We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	No
35032	Our universities have become more diverse as a result.	Yes
14046	And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	No
22019	I agree with the governor.	No
7513	I ask you for your help.	No
37078	During my tenure, we were faced with a bureaucratic nightmare similar to the one in Washington today, consisting of 300 agencies, departments, and commissions that were fully funded or partially funded, yet still had conflicting tasks to oversee.	Yes
35966	My economic ideas, which involve 9 Nobel laureates, over 500 economists, and a significant number of businesspeople, including many Republicans, are the most convincing argument that this is the right approach.	Yes
19377	Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	No
16750	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	No
3152	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	Yes
38245	Changing jobs means that you will be covered.	Yes
1344	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	No
6586	I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	No
7961	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	No
38016	The special interests are outspending me, while this man has spent more money on me.	Yes
39248	My administration is the first to take an antitrust action against companies in the country that are accused of collaborating with the Arab boycott, and I'm very proud of it.	Yes
18744	I believe we could have done better.	No
35177	This is one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate among industrial states in the country.	Yes
17656	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	Yes
7029	He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	No
35891	If you follow the programs I've discussed, as well as those related to job retraining and education that address the issue of interest rates and inflation, which is currently the most severe tax in the world, it will have a different impact.	Yes
3147	He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	No
38600	The growth rate in China is 7 percent.	Yes
1812	So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	No
7977	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	No
16322	and must do what he's talking about now.	No
13312	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	No
38882	We are being robbed of our rights to intellectual property, patents, designs, and technology, as well as the ability to hack into computers and counterfeit goods.	Yes
14429	And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	Yes
33644	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	Yes
28626	I'm for research and development.	No
24563	See, our differences are our strengths.	No
6942	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	No
39119	The task has not been accomplished by them.	Yes
13106	I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	Yes
7642	We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	No
32705	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	Yes
28571	They're aimed at the real problem.	No
32076	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	No
20843	Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	No
38127	He made a commitment to the American people in 1980 that he would never decrease benefits.	Yes
10851	Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	No
11751	Well, I mentioned Third World debt.	No
2167	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	Yes
24576	We don't have a person to waste in this country.	No
35948	In the first quarter of this year, the average was about 18%.	Yes
6785	I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	No
27065	And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	No
38893	The vice president's desire to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers is contradicted by his administration'S federal furlough program, which is among the most permissive in the country. Last year, around 7,000 people were furled while others were given temporary leave.	Yes
26604	It's something you might consider.	No
31891	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	No
33742	I'll be against it when I'm president.	No
30367	You have -- wait a minute.	No
21891	That's the way the game's played now.	No
36711	The Nixon-Ford Administration started with a 10 percent ratio.	Yes
38843	They and Rochester, New York provide insurance coverage for 98% of their population, which is much cheaper than in other parts of the United States.	Yes
18748	With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	Yes
10665	We can work on nuclear power plants.	No
4121	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	No
18061	And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	Yes
4042	And when I'm president, I will.	No
6293	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	No
3617	I can tell you, it's rife.	No
38037	I am of the opinion that there are 20 million individuals who have health insurance.	Yes
138	So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	No
38599	The Republican Ambassadors, Arthur Gardner and Earl Smith respectively indicated that they had reported to Washington in the last six weeks that Castro was a Marxist, Raul Castro belonged to Communist Party, and that their efforts did not yield positive results.	Yes
32930	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	Yes
8397	And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	No
287	I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.	No
38339	My balanced budget proposal allocates ten years' worth of funds to the Medicare.	Yes
25328	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	Yes
8854	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	Yes
23788	The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	No
2478	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	No
36253	Witness Lynn Martin's remarkable performance in breaking through the glass.	Yes
27673	And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	Yes
38294	The 43 governors' line item, which allows the president to clean up any pork barrel items if cuts are not made, is my preferred solution.	Yes
15236	The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	Yes
38355	I know that Governor Carter vetoed thirty-five to forty bills annually while in office as Governor of Georgia.	Yes
19701	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	Yes
36533	First, President Clinton defeated the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.	Yes
32633	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	No
7422	I think we have to come together and work to change it.	No
27557	Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	Yes
30331	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	No
27554	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	No
7242	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	No
35345	The $2.3 trillion surplus can be utilized to ensure that younger workers have access to Social Security benefits in the future.	Yes
36265	This is twice the rate of return that the current Social Security Trust provides.	Yes
1188	If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	No
20085	Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	Yes
28907	You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	No
39332	Handguns have been refused to 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers.	Yes
873	I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	No
766	That is a very serious charge against the president.	No
29201	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	Yes
38780	The majority of the tax reduction was given to the country's wealthiest individuals.	Yes
37999	His primary immigration consultant is the individual who crafted the Arizona law, not just E-Verify.	Yes
16581	And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	No
16009	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	No
36480	You backed legislation this year that necessitated tax increases not once, but twice.	Yes
16476	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	Yes
39463	Federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research has been authorized by me, making me the first president to do so.	Yes
12240	We have to be bold.	No
17531	The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	No
9183	Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	No
33170	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	No
14367	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	Yes
32599	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	Yes
24750	I'm tired of being told we can't.	No
6493	But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	No
12065	And we can enforce law.	No
12450	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	No
24710	I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	No
24361	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	No
37361	Thousands of homes that are owned by government entities have been vandalized and taken away as mortgage foreclosures.	Yes
1458	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	Yes
37631	There has been a decline in the wages of Americans.	Yes
35679	During the beginning of the Korean War, Secretary Acheson delivered a well-known speech at the Press Club, indicating that South Korea was beyond the United States' defense perimeter.	Yes
26286	If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	Yes
39429	Your 30 years of dedication have resulted in you only now having the courage to think of solutions.	Yes
23416	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	Yes
16254	I think a great many of them have come out today.	No
19334	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	No
6964	And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	No
17743	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	No
15734	I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	No
12235	You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.	No
38940	The Eisenhower Administration has yielded five times the wages of the Truman Administration.	Yes
3543	Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	No
32638	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	No
26925	And that's what we've done over the last four years.	No
2944	And let me cite several examples.	No
37454	Additionally, we experienced a 2 percent surge in employee numbers over the previous year.	Yes
12612	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	No
10067	But she works for me.	No
14127	Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	No
35116	The defense budget saw a 37% reduction in seven out of eight years.	Yes
35524	I vetoed the product liability bill that was passed by them, and I believed it was related to this issue.	Yes
14275	Sometimes he has to act.	No
27852	We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	No
39164	Additionally, the Republican Congress slashed $53 billion.	Yes
38326	I opposed the grain embargo in my government.	Yes
3558	Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	No
35255	Even though we cut the number of people receiving food stamps by 850,000 because they were earning income beyond what allowed their fellow citizens to support themselves, there are still more people on the program than ever before, with 2,300,000 more individuals now receiving them.	Yes
2695	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	No
35698	The border is being invaded by drugs.	Yes
24934	But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	Yes

37607	The bombs have been transferred to our defenses, leaving us vulnerable.	Yes
38878	Terrorist groups receive some of the $700 billion.	Yes
38911	I was not subjected to the same actions as Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole.	Yes
4326	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	Yes
14480	The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	No
37763	It has been endorsed by 9 economists who won the Nobel Prize and 500 others, including many Republican and Democratic business leaders, because it offers the best chance of making America work again and seeing our incomes rise instead of falling.	Yes
17037	The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	No
36940	After conducting business with Gadhafi, he advocated for the actions we carried out in Libya and demanded his removal.	Yes
21240	I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	No
16801	This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	No
14252	And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	Yes
39201	At present, we provide $15 billion per year in subsidies to private insurance companies through the Medicare program.	Yes
14971	The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	Yes
38726	Mr. Ford fails to understand the impact on human beings when there are five hundred thousand more individuals without work than there were three months ago, and two and a half million more people out of work as president.	Yes
23844	And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	No
13400	So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	No
29278	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	Yes
33415	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	Yes
35123	Last year, we had the largest deficit in our country's history, which was $65 billion, surpassing the deficit spending of the previous eight years under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	Yes
36256	Independent studies have found that my tax relief to middle-class families is three times greater than Senator McCain's, based on our respective plans.	Yes
20801	He decides who the right people are.	No
28934	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	No
32448	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
35103	Each person typically consumes five cents per day in the food package.	Yes
39047	We are currently sending supplies to support the hungry children of Somalia.	Yes
23742	Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	No
24369	We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	Yes
6251	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	No
30129	And they're going to do that.	No
16176	I am for clean water.	No
6549	That costs the government $7,700 per family.	Yes
12909	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	No
19753	It is a very difficult environment.	No
3902	The question is, was this wise?	No
32520	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	Yes
21833	Ross was very articulate across the country.	No
38943	His speech highlighted his desire to secure tax relief for those who are entitled to it.	Yes
4133	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	Yes
26196	My whole administration is about your future.	No
38111	We have spent $4 trillion.	Yes
37439	Moreover, it is unlawful as Congress has established that we cannot accept a treaty that does not require us to be equal.	Yes
32298	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	No
1418	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	No
19949	It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.	Yes
27653	When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	No
19202	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	Yes
37549	Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Senator Green wrote to the President on October 2, 1958, stating that there was no need for any other American to believe that the U.S. would engage in military conflict solely to protect Quemoy and Matsu.	Yes
38258	I have a history of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our country requires.	Yes
6935	They have poor-quality health care.	No
37857	In his bid for the Presidency, his running mate revealed that they would incur a 30% inflation rate within two years, and he pointed to his top economic advisor, Paul Macavoy, as the source of this information.	Yes
37276	My state's drug education and prevention program is a source of pride for the nation, as stated by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.	Yes
15786	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	No
36919	He is seeking to offer an extra $700,000 in tax relief to the average CEO of the Fortune 500.	Yes
15908	Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	No
36852	Seventy-five percent have been prosecuted.	Yes
36316	Unlike my opponent, he is an expert in national defense and helped modify the INF treaty to ensure a sound deal when discussing freezing.	Yes
1678	I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	No
21871	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	No
3336	Let me restate uh - our policy.	No
17191	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	No
1591	It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	Yes
25318	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	No
17553	What does this mean in real life?	No
34663	Mr. Newman stated that the Bureau of Census revealed that Governor Carter's spending during his time as governor of Georgia increased by over 50%, and government employees grew by more than 25%.	Yes
37404	He cannot come here and declare that he has created health care for Americans, given that 5 million Americans have lost their healthcare, with 96,000 living in Missouri.	Yes
1386	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	No
16055	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	No
38321	Private individuals are gathering 900 FBI files at the Whitehouse.	Yes
16491	I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	Yes
5984	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	No
23839	I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	No
18966	Russia is a country in transition.	No
4284	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	No
13257	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	No
17786	Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	No
38705	The bill of rights for patients we have is one of the most sophisticated.	Yes
36887	The strip-mining bill was vetoed by me, Mr. Kraft, as it was widely believed that it would have resulte in the disappearance of thousands of jobs and roughly one hundred thousand bullets.	Yes
20310	If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	Yes
22103	I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	No
3027	He indicates he would not make those.	No
7607	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	Yes
36186	All my children and roughly 98 percent of adults were insured while I was governor of my state.	Yes
26633	And that's the economic package again.	No
37194	I should mention that the only known 25-percent cut in Social Security was a 25 percent reduction in benefits for all Americans born after 1916, which coincided with the massive tax increase of 1977.	Yes
21120	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	No
37072	As previously noted, we have achieved a new record-breaking number of jobs by adding approximately nine million in the same timeframe.	Yes
33548	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	Yes
7048	Sure, there's more work to do.	No
21856	You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	No
36801	Political expediency is the reason why the Fed keeps interest rates at this level.	Yes
35202	The repeal of Obamacare is expected to result in the loss of health insurance for approximately 50 million individuals.	Yes
37503	Mr. Dewey was the final candidate to state that he had prior knowledge of his cabinet selection in 1948.	Yes
13253	I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	No
3008	These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	No
2334	That's why I'd have regulation.	No
8384	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	No
36331	At a time when the Iraqis have an $79 billion surplus, we are spending $10 billion per month in Iraq.	Yes
22554	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	Yes
38346	My only comment to address the issue is that Mr. Bush had previously stated that there was no recession in his administration and then opted for compromise with Congress instead.	Yes
19032	And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	No
35547	The president is currently investing hundreds of millions of dollars in researching nuclear weapons that can be destroyed in bunkers.	Yes
10691	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	No
36956	The majority of Americans, specifically 98%, are receiving a tax reduction and health care benefits.	Yes
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	Yes
21486	I don't want to --	No
26071	It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.	Yes
3956	Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	No
24413	We're working through the international organizations.	No
24085	We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	No
20357	Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	No
16011	And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	No
35832	The record does not demonstrate that.	Yes
25346	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
36382	It disputed all the measures proposed by President Roosevelt and others, such as the minimum wage, housing, economic development, and natural resource preservation.	Yes
7749	It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	Yes
29190	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	No
28594	You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	No
22274	At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	No
37572	Iran was not involved in the 1973 oil embargo.	Yes
9669	That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	No
17139	These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	No
36037	Despite the fact that a drunk driver caused smashed school bus, there was still trouble with the vehicle, and it resulted in the death of one child from my Oval Office team.	Yes
34739	The middle class tax cut was vetoed by him this year.	Yes
19968	That's what our message is to the people watching.	No
34528	Firstly, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion are not true.	Yes
36595	We have discovered that this is one of their preferred methods of creating chaos and collecting information.	Yes
2062	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	No
17626	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	Yes
17670	And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	No
34618	Our income has grown at a faster pace than the national average in the past 5 years.	Yes
8967	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	Yes
13798	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	Yes
37560	His power is expanding due to the Administration's neglect of Latin America.	Yes
26637	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	No
13680	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	No
8459	It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	Yes
23646	Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	No
3245	He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	No
19836	There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	Yes
3062	But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	No
8593	The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	Yes
966	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	No

3673	With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	Yes
1215	And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	Yes
29287	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	No

24310	And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	No
25481	Let's take your warhead principle.	No
34794	The use of those weapons against their own people resulted in the deaths of Americans.	Yes
17815	This economy is starting to run downhill.	No
27083	But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	No
6060	We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	No

19871	It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	Yes
35365	I would like to emphasize that Medicare has lower administrative costs compared to private insurance, which is why seniors are generally satisfied with it, according to numerous studies.	Yes

12720	Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	No
24293	We've got to help them.	No
37086	My proposal is to decrease the deficit by precisely $4 trillion.	Yes
3014	And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	Yes
17240	And so, we made a proposal.	No
880	When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	No
38904	Since my tenure as president, I think that we have negotiated with the Soviet Union from a strong position.	Yes

19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	No
11079	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	No
27156	You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	No
20636	And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	No

38728	The number of jobs we have is still 9 million.	Yes
36299	I believe that the Administration's high interest-rate policy has resulted in an annual increase of approximately three billion dollars to debt funding, which is a burden on taxpayers.	Yes

32111	What about the other 15,000?	No
18661	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	No
23979	Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	No

25632	We know nothing about them.	No
20350	Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	No
16553	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	Yes
35520	The national unemployment rate is at an all-time low, despite the emergence of 22 million new jobs.	Yes
15852	But he's in the arena.	No
34061	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	Yes
21456	I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	No
39398	Credit agencies were labeling these as A1 high-quality investments, but they were not.	Yes
24040	Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	Yes
8116	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	No

27799	If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	No
8032	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	No
20205	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	No
8424	We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	No
36076	The fact that we will be in debt for an additional $50 million within an hour and a half while sitting here tonight is intriguing to me.	Yes
21018	Too many people have been left behind.	No
36557	The fact that we have brought down interest rates and the deficit makes me believe that they are better off than everyone else.	Yes
36415	Our national product growth was the weakest among all industrial nations, as we heard tonight.	Yes
20615	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	No
28304	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	No
12016	But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	No
35092	Some in the country lack the motivation to fight it, while those who are on the front line, as you know, have a strong connection to law enforcement and some of them are fighting hard to keep their lives safe.	Yes
23104	You can pull it off of the Internet.	No
36717	A reduction in production through a drop in support price has not been successful, leaving us with the highest surplus of nine billion dollars.	Yes
474	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	No
6319	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	Yes
6357	But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	Yes
35250	The decision is a strategic misstep, as every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida poses the most significant threat to the United States, and Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front was located in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	Yes
8129	I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	Yes
13456	I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	No

38036	As I understand it, 20 million people have access to health insurance.	Yes
12730	I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	No
27972	We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	No
4408	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	No
12961	And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	No
15500	And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	No
13892	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	Yes
8666	That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	No

14421	Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	Yes
13152	Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	Yes
37847	Despite Iran's move towards developing nuclear weapons, which involves producing around 37 tons of yellow cake for their enriched uranium, North Korea has already reduced its bomb count to four to seven.	Yes
19777	That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	No
36904	Texas's government has risen, while the federal government is falling.	Yes
19098	We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	Yes
38406	I have struggled to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	Yes
38390	When I was in California, I vetoed several bills related to that type.	Yes
11812	But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	No
7721	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	Yes
20120	And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	Yes
15454	This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	No
8689	conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	No
953	And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	No
27285	And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	No
14432	And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	No
7707	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	No
20836	That's my vision for public education all around America.	No
1942	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	No
12032	like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	No
37331	It's becoming more and more challenging to defeat them as they are establishing themselves in increasingly many places, states, and nations.	Yes
35057	As per your statement, the unemployment rate had hit 5.4 percent by now.	Yes
12024	It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	No
5700	Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	No
1691	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	No

38716	The United States has the highest number of employed individuals in its history, with a workforce of eighty-eight million.	Yes
36467	The implementation of Obamacare has led to a $1 trillion increase in their amount.	Yes
6636	Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	Yes
13959	And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	No
9175	I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	No

27969	I want to see peace.	No
38128	The latest update on new purchases is the lowest it has been since 1982.	Yes
32025	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	Yes

Yes
14876	But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	No

7279	I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	Yes
10838	I have fought excess spending.	Yes
25969	That's what drug it out.	No

20225	We know how to set agendas.	No
27472	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	No
35048	My opposition is due to their apprehension that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who pay the highest rates, which they fear.	Yes
29155	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	No
7719	Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	No
8036	But it didn't mean that.	No
35359	After feeling secure, they can move on to more normal social, economic, and political paths, just as they do in Iraq.	Yes

14932	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	No
6600	He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	Yes

22779	And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	No
26938	Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	No
17321	And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	No
33413	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	No

24417	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	No
17581	And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	Yes

10300	That's what brings jobs in.	No
36092	The number of Americans without jobs has increased by 5% in the current year compared to three months ago, and since Mr. Ford's first two years as president, unemployment has surged by 50%, from five million to two and a half million people out of work.	Yes
22148	And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	No

30054	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	Yes
19537	So we need more protection from America.	No

22195	The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	No
2602	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	No
11667	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	No
28640	I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	No
8088	That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	No

18848	I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	No
2898	Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	No

7641	We lost three thousand American lives.	Yes
37036	It's not political in nature.	Yes
1493	As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	Yes
3046	The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.

7690	Secondly, as an executive leader.	No
34616	This administration refrained from implementing arms control for 31/2 years, refused to tabulate arms controls proposals that had any chance of being agreed upon, and criticized their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to reaching a deal on medium-range weapons.	Yes
13912	We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	No
38291	Despite the lack of interaction, this president has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	Yes
16282	Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	No

3225	South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	No
24184	You don't have anywhere to sleep.	No

6595	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	Yes
16194	I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	No

36924	Teachers and parents, often business people, have created 3,000 new schools called charter schools, which are funded by money and have no regulations or bureaucratic restrictions. They can only continue to exist if they deliver children.	Yes
23680	And I'll take responsibility for them.	No
18468	I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	No
37222	The Soviet Ambassador arrived on the day that Guinea became independent.	Yes
6110	If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.	No
24351	I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	No
6949	That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	Yes
24201	Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	No
12059	It's really a matter of culture.	No
36850	Others either stayed still or cast their votes against us.	Yes

8664	Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	Yes
36044	Despite the small business exemption, Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he believed that other nations could not do so.	Yes
15797	Members of the clergy who have done the same.	No
32968	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	No

23911	Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	No
18900	We have to do this job.	No
13105	Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	No
7704	We set a very high standard for ourselves.	No

34575	He has been granted over $100 billion in tax reductions and incentives.	Yes
11970	Well, I have no idea.	No
3986	And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	No
28621	It's not the right thing to do.	No
15728	We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	Yes

38721	The budget that I recommended was reduced by half, resulting in a growth of 5 to 5 and 5%.	Yes
21224	It has been a good, lively exchange.	No
7652	Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	No
25760	They're looking to us for leadership.	No

36615	This president is the first in a long line of Republican and Democratic presidents who have lost their jobs due to economic struggles, recessions, or similar factors.	Yes

23058	"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	No
23779	And abroad, we're at war.	No
8747	I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	Yes
35503	Following 9/11, the 28 nations of NATO agreed to accompany us to Afghanistan for the purpose of battling terrorism, and they are still supporting us in this endeavor.	Yes
19992	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	No

38177	For every woman who completes the same amount of work, a man earns only $1 while he earn's just 59 cents.	Yes

19570	You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	Yes
6180	That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	No
16000	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	Yes
35574	The proceedings were heard by a judge who was highly anti-police.	Yes
20592	And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	No
21748	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	No
37192	He neglected to take on the malpractice suit people and those who bring lawsuits against them, which are frivolous trial lawyers bringing down medical care costs from 25 to 50 billion.	Yes
28407	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	No
20033	But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	No
36699	With 100 nuclear warheads under their belt, Pakistan is an essential player in the region, the world, and us.	Yes
17019	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	No
3240	Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	No
22440	Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	No
35161	We're utilizing the military more frequently in interdiction.	Yes
22821	A president's job is to win the peace.	No
11984	But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	No
10182	We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	No
35351	Our team did not create a board that can inform individuals about the final treatments they will undergo.	Yes
38324	They now maintain that they are not.	Yes
38598	Over the last six weeks, both Republican Ambassadors, Arthur Gardner and Earl Smith, reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist and Raul Castro had  Communist views, but they did not achieve any significant progress.	Yes
22431	Thank you very, very much.	No
37105	Even with the massive tax increase in 1977, it barely held up.	Yes
21094	It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	No
25715	What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	No
37938	The total value of locked assets in America is 7 trillion dollars.	Yes
23510	Now that's not a flip-flop.	No
30417	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	No
35049	I am opposed to it because they are afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who pay the most expensive rates, and therefore do not want to involve Medicare in this situation.	Yes
36845	I have received the support of 200 generals and admirals.	Yes
2795	Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	No
23679	He shouldn't have made that decision.	No
34806	A Senate with a Democratic majority has not allowed it to proceed.	Yes
7078	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	No
36101	The distortion of the conversation about more people working has resulted in women and young people having to work for weeks due to their fathers' lack of income, which is also a contributing factor to the 14 percent increase in the cost of living over the last two years.	Yes
16849	I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	No
38278	The investment of $90 billion has been made in green jobs.	Yes
13661	And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	Yes
36304	Their proposal to impose extra out-of-pocket expenses in their budget was rejected by me.	Yes
38011	Several wealthy Middle Eastern nations are endeavoring to acquire nuclear weapons in the region.	Yes
13335	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	No
27684	And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	No
23755	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	No
22007	But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	No
34545	By keeping the same fee for service as Medicare, the governor's proposal would result in premium increases of 18% to 47%, which was based on the findings of Medicare actuaries.	Yes
37151	More than half of the 10 and a half million new jobs are concentrated in areas with higher wages, which will result in an increase in manufacturing and sales across the globe.	Yes
7536	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	No
2794	In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.	No
38769	We aided Libya in disarming.	Yes
7999	Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	No
38557	They handle 60% of the obligations that necessitate documentation completion.	Yes
25706	And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	No
22556	Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	Yes
35927	When I was here four years ago, I declared that I would decrease taxes for middle-class households.	Yes
6290	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	No
6340	It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	No
3668	Look, it's just not true.	No
13466	I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	Yes
27057	What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	Yes
17318	And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	No
27044	That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	No
35720	Governor Romney is now aiming to extend the tax breaks.	Yes
23417	I think you ought to get the break.	No
24583	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	No
36252	Lynn Martin is battling against the glass ceiling and doing an outstanding job.	Yes
13598	I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	Yes
15834	And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	No
6370	And it's great to be with you again.	No
36653	Moreover, we have only started to lease out 2% of the outer continental shelf for oil, as there are believed to be significant reserves still unexplored.	Yes
14815	America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	No
26677	They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	No
23929	Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	No
34281	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	No
38251	Approximately one thousand raised their hands.	Yes
37536	The intelligence I examined in 2002 was also scrutinized by my adversary, who asserted that Saddam Hussein posed a significant danger.	Yes
37956	He was a co-sponsor of the tax cut I am proposing, saying that it would be advantageous for the working class in this country and help combat inflation.	Yes
37743	In 1988, our country spent $400 million on lobbying, which is the core problem.	Yes
8309	I think that this farm policy has failed.	No
15209	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	Yes
16016	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	No
1730	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	Yes
2627	When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.	Yes
24500	Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts.	Yes
29041	Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	Yes
28780	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	No
25442	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	No
17096	The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.	Yes
29487	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	No
19706	We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	Yes
19746	I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	No
36384	We are aware of five countries that possess atomic bombs.	Yes
16770	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	Yes
25340	And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	Yes
25137	The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	No
34457	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	No
17712	The interest rates are based on inflation.	No
9489	He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	No
13084	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	No
25309	I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	No
32669	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	No

12682	Now let's just see what this means.	No

29401	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	No
38687	The president's spending, climate change, prisoner torture, and Guantanamo Bay have all been topics of my opposition to him.	Yes
3337	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	Yes
16463	It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	Yes
15501	You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	No
17915	The President's record is quite different.	No
39281	During my presidential campaign, I promised to reduce the deficit by half in four years, but we ended up cutting it by 60 percent.	Yes
18187	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	No
39363	Before I arrived, there was a decline in the stock market six months ago.	Yes
14466	Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	No
6850	Let me give you a prime example.	No
15621	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	No
13000	We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	No
28651	And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	No
34822	The idea of working on welfare reform began in 1980 when I grew tired of seeing people trapped in a system that was isolating them and making their children more susceptible to mistreatment.	Yes
13818	You've got to free up the private sector.	No
35000	I recently visited the oldest American Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they are planning to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year and have generated 700 new jobs.	Yes
38347	Mr. Bush's statement about the economy was that there was no recession, but he ultimately decided to pursue compromise with Congress instead.	Yes
1169	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	No
34902	During my address to the UN in May, I proposed that we take immediate action to declare a complete moratorium on testing all nuclear devices, both peaceful and weapons, and refrain from transferring atomic fuel to neophytically-reactive countries that do not adhere to strict regulations regarding waste management.	Yes
7868	President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	No
14396	We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	Yes
22161	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	No
312	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	No
39063	A 550 percent increase in tax rates is what Hillary Clinton wants to sanction over Obama.	Yes
3873	I was honored to speak to those troops.	No
3872	I was honored to be there.	No
2219	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	No
14548	And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	No
25204	Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	No
8783	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	Yes
36891	This year, we have exported more coal than ever before.	Yes
35056	You stated that the unemployment rate would be 5.4 percent by now.	Yes
38990	Despite the death toll of civilians in Syria, I remain convinced that Assad is still in power.	Yes
38029	There is no possibility of any additional money being added to the debt, and your proposals would add $5 trillion to it.	Yes
36067	I have proposed a proposal that would require medical care for the elderly to be funded through Social Security taxes, with each person spending less than three cents per day on their own.	Yes
13251	Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	Yes
27218	I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	No
38924	Creating healthier environments for children in schools has been achieved through the implementation of healthier lunches.	Yes
35306	As a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	Yes
19116	I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	No
29456	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	No
35098	The president's tax cuts are a one-time deal, and they expire in 2000, according to Pam, but these increases are permanent.	Yes
33289	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	No
34976	$40 billion is being directed towards Bermuda.	Yes
12041	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	Yes
36706	A significant number of new permits for housing were issued.	Yes
38107	The Transportation Department saw a reduction of approximately 25 percent in its workforce.	Yes
25179	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	No
38737	We've doubled the number of loans from small business administration and tripled our loan offerings to women entrepreneurs, with all individuals meeting certain criteria regardless of their qualifications.	Yes
17528	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	No
23881	We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	No
39174	We were the first to issue sanctions.	Yes
6040	Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	Yes
20154	Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	No
31912	And I was embarrassed by it.	No
11739	I certainly agree with that.	No
23339	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	Yes
34835	Pay $1 per hour for your work and lack of health care is the most expensive factor in creating the car.	Yes
27123	This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	No
13925	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
12827	Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	No
13166	It's a question of who they are.	No
26353	And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	Yes
9967	You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	No
36358	$15 billion is spent annually on subsidies for insurance companies as a demonstration of some cuts.	Yes
35318	Our debt is increasing by more than $1 billion each year.	Yes
11012	Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	Yes
25285	That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	No
38492	Should it be overturned, marriage will ultimately be defined by the courts, which is not in the best interest of our country.	Yes
14388	So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	No
35640	I think it's correct that Governor Carter is advocating for gun control by recommending the discontinuation of the sale of Saturday Night S- Specials, but he also wants to register handguns.	Yes
28324	We need to have accountability.	No
24360	So I would be firm.	No
36901	Young African-American and Latino males were incarcerated for nonviolent crimes, which was excessive.	Yes
10094	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	No
35537	Moreover, it is evident that the Congress has experienced a significant surge in the number of employees hired over the past four years, surpassing the gross national product by more than any other measure in our society.	Yes
9001	But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	No
1368	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	Yes
38205	Despite the deletion of 33,000 emails, she maintains that there was no harm in doing so.	Yes
15328	Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	No
22220	I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.	No
1213	For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	Yes
17602	All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	Yes
23407	If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	No
33031	There is a thing called clean coal.	No
17276	And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	No
38796	Our merchandise is being imported from China, Vietnam, and other countries worldwide.	Yes
3457	But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	Yes
36752	There has never been a situation like this, where individuals send e-mails to multiple offices for subpoenas, delete them after the deadline, and then bleach or acid wash them, which is an expensive process.	Yes
35366	Even though this administration has been in power for two years or more, they have not taken any decisive steps to curb the global proliferation of nuclear waste, particularly plutonium.	Yes
677	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	No
15811	I think of Dr. Fauci.	No
25155	The terrorists have won each time.	No
19705	Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	No
39475	The impact of high interest rates, which have risen twofold due to the current administration, is evident in Mexico and other countries, where repaying them is a costly endeavor that leads to significant unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
35599	Detroit is being taxed for a certain amount, which could potentially be utilized to support Chicago and help resolve the issues in Philadelphia.	Yes
37931	Out of thirty-eight Presidents, this one was the first to resign from public office due to pressure.	Yes
22850	It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	No
38921	Our tax liability has decreased by 19 times.	Yes
11738	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	No
33992	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	Yes
7682	Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	No
34607	In order to avoid revenue loss and government depletion, I decrease deductions such as taxes, credits, and exemptions, while still maintaining the same amount of revenue for growth.	Yes
38661	22000 miners are currently unemployed as a result of the mines being shut down.	Yes
26127	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	No
34612	I stated in 1992 that he failed to show kindness to President Bush.	Yes
34523	Historically, we have observed the subjugation of elected governments, such as in Chile, and the staunch support of military authoritarianism.	Yes
26574	But maybe there ought to be more debates.	No
35065	The 43-month period of unemployment exceeding 8 percent and 23 million Americans struggling to secure a decent job do not require us to settle for anything.	Yes
8195	We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	Yes
22480	They're not going to be solved overnight.	No
8618	And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	No
38981	Just as I saved Social Security with a bipartisan commission, I'm also working to save your Medicare.	Yes
21885	And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	No
16097	I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	No
39024	You were completely in favor of it.	Yes
37828	Let me clarify what we have done in the White House with regard to federal employees. My first order after taking office was to decrease or eliminate the proposed forty-thousand increase in federal staff that my predecessor had scheduled.	Yes
29715	You walk down the street, you get shot.	No
36064	This is the first time we're bringing Japanese rice from California to our table.	Yes
35069	I compelled both Republicans and Democrats to work together in Texas to pass a patient's bill of rights.	Yes
22773	And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	No
12599	Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?	Yes
38852	His proposals for tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are higher than the combined spending on health care, education, and national defense, as indicated by his budget figures.	Yes
37510	Except for this administration, the inflation rate has been the highest in twenty-five years to date.	Yes
16864	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	No
24649	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	No
37208	Has incorporated him into our foreign policy and has been channeling aid to Contras through drug traffickers with a track record.	Yes
17968	I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	No
15020	Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	Yes
4093	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	No
13613	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	Yes
13125	Now, that is the issue.	No
24642	2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	No
35290	Mr. Mondale appears to support MAD, which stands for mutual destruction, meaning that any nuclear attack on our nation will result in the death of yours as well as ours.	Yes
36394	The upcoming presidential election in Afghanistan will see a voter turnout of ten million.	Yes
34392	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	No
36024	I aim to ensure that the information is kept on file as it was only 14 days before the president labeled the Benghazi attack as an act of terror.	Yes
21683	And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	No
37906	Over the past two years, there has been a rise of $23 billion in the cost of unemployment compensation, welfare compensation and lost revenues.	Yes
16740	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	Yes
5854	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	No
34345	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	Yes
38699	I presented a proposal to the Congress two years ago that promotes environmental conservation and encourages technology to explore more sustainable options for coal, including coal and gas.	Yes
32986	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	No
39427	We made a small effort, but we managed to fix it and ensure that 37 to 40 million people receive their checks on time.	Yes
22649	I always believed he was a threat.	No
38076	We've augmented that by 25 percent.	Yes
36890	The amount of coal we have exported this year is the highest it has ever been.	Yes
23311	Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	Yes
35017	Our energy policy is not yet in place.	Yes
2009	If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	Yes
8363	There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	No
12905	He says that he voted for the resolution.	Yes
18705	"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."	No
390	Builders and community leaders are ready.	No
7786	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	No
34596	The tax preferences he received in 1983 resulted in him paying slightly more than 12 percent, totaling 12.8 percent.	Yes
7791	And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	Yes
9196	We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	No
1599	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	No
36226	$5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits, and cuts were returned to our people.	Yes
37079	When I assumed the role of aver, we were confronted with essentially the same bureaucratic chaos as in Washington, consisting of 300 agencies, departments, bureaus, and commissions that had conflicting budgets.	Yes
26818	But beyond that we need to address the economy.	No
8308	We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
27812	Nothing could be further from the truth.	No
39053	The United States can honor its treaty obligations and stand ready to defend it if an attack on Formosa was planned, as the Chinese Communists have repeatedly stated that they only want to take control of the islands.	Yes
6614	Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	No
22451	Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	No
28497	I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	No
36462	We have a safety net, and we're providing it to more people than any other government in this land.	Yes
15372	But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	No
36234	The suggestion made by Mr. Nixon is that the United States should declare war on these two islands if they are attacked.	Yes
13535	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	No
38817	Our deficit in 1979 was $29 billion for the entire year.	Yes
38760	By chance, Mel Carnahan was the most successful governor in Missouri's history when it came to addressing diversity.	Yes
23367	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	Yes
13293	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	No
14849	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	No
8080	Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	No
35853	A workforce deficit of seven and a half million people has resulted in unemployment.	Yes
3782	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	No
39481	During this time, our focus has been primarily on developing cruise missiles, which can be launched from land-based mobile installations, high-performance aircraft like B-52s or B-1s and surface or submarine naval vessels.	Yes
22843	So what do we do?	No
11821	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	No
33098	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	No
11820	That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	No
38959	Currently, Israel has 75 percent of the vote.	Yes
7983	Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	No
34952	Senator McCain has made it clear that my proposal involves cutting more than what I'm currently spending, resulting in a net spending cut.	Yes
8508	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	Yes
7329	If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	No
23904	I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.	No
1562	I don't believe the present administration has done that.	No
16341	I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	No
35885	In order to reduce the impact of earthquakes and increase employment opportunities, a composite will be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway.	Yes
34867	A review of the vice president's spending by the Senate Budget Committee took place.	Yes
16206	The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	No
35497	The number of teachers you have laid off in St. Louis is 350.	Yes
19474	You talk about the Brady Bill.	No
15178	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	Yes
38376	Our per capita income is almost the same as that of Germany, but our consumption of energy in terms of housing is two times higher.	Yes
18954	No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	No
1060	I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	No
24338	And so, we've got a good military.	No
15831	No, let me tell you something about that.	No
12866	We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	Yes
22781	Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	Yes
32497	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	No
34712	The slowing down of growth is a side effect of raising taxes.	Yes
37431	For weeks, I have been reading about Mosul as the location where people believe the leaders of ISIS are located, positioned between Raqqa and MosUL.	Yes
16379	Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	No
17157	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	Yes
39350	Up to this point, Mr. Ford has not done it.	Yes
36824	By adding up, he has spent more money on a tax cut for the top 1% than all his new prescription drug, healthcare, education, and national defense proposals combined.	Yes
34435	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	No
36733	Government-funded health care is created by them.	Yes
34079	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	No
35773	All of you will receive a tax credit worth $5,000, as stated by him.	Yes
28921	I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	No
16990	It's a time for unity.	No
7232	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	No
7140	The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	Yes
39390	My health-care plan includes it.	Yes
29734	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	No
38543	From a strategic national security standpoint, al Qaeda is now stronger and more formidable than it has ever been since 2001, with reports of 30,000 people being wounded.	Yes
36205	Rather than aiding taxpayers in reducing costs, the president illegally made it possible for Medicare to negotiate lower prices, rather than providing assistance to seniors who require less expensive medications.	Yes
35095	The purchase of a computer for their child's college education results in increased spending, increased customer demand, higher profits, and employee recruitment.	Yes
23299	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	No
26701	Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	No
33013	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	No
8347	Sometimes my advice has been taken.	No
34853	We also reduce taxes for everyone.	Yes
39371	Over the past four years, we've had more than 200 distinct trade deals.	Yes
38380	The total amount is 10 cents per year.	Yes
37546	The Lewin report correctly noted that over 20 million people will be added to the government's health care, which is currently under state control.	Yes
12699	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	No
1231	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	Yes
7231	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	Yes
12040	I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	No
37833	During that time, I suggested to a key member of the House Budget Committee that recalculating the cost of living benefits for civil service and military retirees could potentially save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion.	Yes
21563	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	No
8412	I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	No
39328	Ronald Reagan, the individual who I held in high esteem and still hold in contention, expressed his desire to send Marines into Lebanon as a new US congressman in 1983.	Yes
2011	And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	No
28135	We want them to continue that.	No
34802	Employers who are below 50 years old are not included.	Yes
1379	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	Yes
19567	Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	No
23867	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	No
525	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	Yes
14341	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	No
14625	And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	Yes
33486	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	Yes
21593	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	No
69	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	No
14727	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	No
25617	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	No
20122	There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	Yes
13657	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	Yes
16094	And I have made some good sound proposals.	No
17242	And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	Yes
36388	The job we came away with enabled us to create employment opportunities for Americans.	Yes
36183	100,000 troops have been trained, which includes police, guards, special units, and border patrol.	Yes
22248	And we put up with that.	No
6736	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	No
21970	Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	Yes
34593	A loss of one million jobs would have been inevitable.	Yes
24647	Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	Yes
12380	And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	No
27855	This is a company, this isn't basic research.	No
18521	And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	No
19042	We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	No
195	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	No
3716	And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	Yes
12925	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	Yes
7915	It - my view is the same as his.	No
24681	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	No
16797	He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.	No
3281	On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	Yes
23973	We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	No
25065	Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	No
1739	Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.	Yes
24404	And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	No
20222	Well, we do come from different places.	No
34494	The revolution's promise included democracy, human rights, free labor unions, and free press.	Yes
4230	So, this is a very difficult situation.	No
18753	The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	Yes
37790	Despite previous reservations, the president's decision to visit the United Nations was not influenced by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft.	Yes
11014	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	No
882	And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	No
15308	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	No
25941	They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	Yes
15295	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	No
37149	Given the Obama administration's attack on energy, I believe that this is a fantastic question to ask.	Yes
31898	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	No
18645	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	No
28972	It's time to have a fresh start.	No
27985	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	No
8404	As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	No
36492	He has reached a value of five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
2557	We use something called Race to the Top.	No
11871	She said, reading is the new civil right.	No
11050	We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	Yes
29121	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	No
12069	And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	No
10122	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	No
8785	And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	Yes
16185	I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	No
12590	I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	No
29443	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	Yes
24029	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	No
22611	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	No
12572	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	No
32518	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	No
38481	They cut $270 billion from Medicare and removed the national guarantee of healthcare for poor children, families with handicaps, elderly people in nursing homes, and impoverished pregnant women.	Yes
23048	I wanted to get something done.	No
22612	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	No
11216	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	No
8472	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	Yes
8430	I favor higher salaries for teachers.	No
17398	So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	No
7024	And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	No
20146	And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	No
2891	I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	No
937	But there are two main focal points of this election.	No
38181	In the Shanghai Communique, it is stated that a peaceful resolution will be necessary to settle disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic.	Yes
5951	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	Yes
38304	Until the age of 26, you must be allowed to keep your child covered on their insurance plan.	Yes
19527	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	Yes
4211	"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	No
35772	He affirms that he will grant a tax credit of $5,000 to everyone.	Yes
37206	The court rejected the reasonable regulation, but they have embraced many more.	Yes
21699	I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	No
26504	I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	No
8900	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	Yes
17584	Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	No
617	Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	No
28220	One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	No
25259	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	No
8388	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	Yes
2176	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	No
38640	We have finalized 21 trade agreements with Japan, and we are soon to finish them.	Yes
74	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	No
36463	Our administration is providing a safety net to more people than any other government in this land.	Yes
38577	To begin with, his recent statement about the State Department is not only false but also a common deception.	Yes
13520	Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	Yes
1986	It means that Governor Romney...	No
13982	This is my point tonight.	No
17363	They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	No
35617	He neglected the defensive practice of medicine, which costs the federal government around $28 billion per year and our society $60 billion to $100 billion annually.	Yes
8375	And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	Yes
36768	Despite the significant investment made in the Vietnam War, President Johnson provided Mr. Nixon with a balanced budget.	Yes
16298	An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	No
36218	We have progressed from the greatest inefficiencies to the largest surpluses.	Yes
462	And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	No
15218	I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	No
38451	Historically, the biggest deficits in American history have been caused by the president's fiscal policies.	Yes
1793	When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	Yes
8063	"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	No
39168	We have made significant progress in nuclear power by conducting research and development under the Energy Research and Development Agency to ensure that our energy sources are safer, more efficient, and have adequate protection.	Yes
23298	Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	No
21824	They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	Yes
3300	I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	No
19955	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	No
19798	I also want a bridge to the truth.	No
2481	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	No
21252	We're at a fork in the road.	No
32380	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	Yes
272	But I salute him for his passion.	No
35332	The president's veto of the Family Leave Act was precisely that.	Yes
36347	He has no experience in transforming healthcare.	Yes
6505	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	No
3269	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	No
10158	For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	No
14144	In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	No
21978	It is because we have not grown.	No
17687	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	Yes
17568	They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	Yes
18125	And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	No
24543	There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	Yes
15791	I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	No
36590	They are currently present in 32 countries.	Yes
20987	In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	No
14085	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	No
28902	During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.	No
34910	Our gross domestic product is expected to increase by approximately 6 percent this year as the economy improves.	Yes
10885	Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	Yes
34531	For the past 12 years, the deficit has been increasing.	Yes
35264	Human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, and elections are among the principles.	Yes
106	And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	Yes
810	25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	No
37913	In the course of this Administration, twenty new African nations were included.	Yes
29962	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	No
35277	He was slamming President Reagan.	Yes
19618	Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	No
38506	The reason for this, I believe, is that we have not kept up with the cost of living since the all-volunteer Army was established in 1973, despite my unwavering support for it.	Yes
37112	The Burger Court's ruling has confirmed the controversial and fundamental decision made by the Warren Court.	Yes
36560	It is my opinion that the Senate, consisting of a majority of Democrats and Republicans, was correct in their rejections of Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	Yes
36473	It's a good thing that Governor Romney acknowledges the threat of Al Qaida.	Yes
5500	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	Yes
26628	Now none of that will happen anymore.	No
27070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	No
34451	Our inner cities are a disaster.	No
33639	But we have horrible deals.	No
36675	Schools are now incorporating forced instruction in subjects like mathematics and science into their curriculum.	Yes
36042	I'm confident that it's achievable and will result in a decrease in inflation, as I did in California.	Yes
27795	And, you know, that's -- you're right.	No
20789	Let me give you some specific examples.	No
1163	I don't believe it does.	No
36032	A financial crisis is the one we have, folks.	Yes
39225	Whether you love the Iran deal or we gave them $150 billion back, there are many different ways to come up with a good deal.	Yes
13734	Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	Yes
24904	This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	No
38465	During his testimony on the food stamp plan in 1957, Mr. Benson stated that 25 million Americans were unable to afford a basic diet.	Yes
36586	Nonetheless, it was a significant shift from administrative positions to service provision.	Yes
13953	And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	Yes
5919	They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	No
339	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	No
13369	But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	No
28112	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	No
35278	His statements about African-Americans, Latinos and Muslims have never been used as a form of apology for his treatment of POWs or immigrants.	Yes
10131	And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	No
35908	Across the nation, I have been approached more frequently by individuals about their health care challenges, including those who have lost their jobs, businesses, or children due to illness.	Yes
35112	We have allocated five times the amount that was approved by the previous Administration for Latin America, as well as two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank and a new billion-dollar bank.	Yes
9342	And so what we did was take away those leases.	No
24107	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	No
35910	As poverty levels rise, the number of people who are eligible for a roll (i.e.	Yes
13282	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
25415	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	No
36761	In Chicago, the practice of stopping and frisk proved to be effective, just as it did in New York.	Yes
28874	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	No
35511	This was the worst inflation since the Great Depression.	Yes
2077	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	Yes
20115	Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	No
18796	They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	No
39191	I am concerned about the potential danger they pose -- I have voted for everything since then.	Yes
2046	I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	No
15227	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	Yes
3884	An election law just in the last few days.	No
11891	There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	No
3831	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	No
30338	I will go very quickly.	No
28250	Now, I said there was a contrast.	No
38148	The administration has admitted to not having completed the training, as they had previously requested a complete reprogramming of the money when they returned to Congress.	Yes
30103	Well, I have to respond.	No
36519	It is common for illegal immigrants to be present in many cases.	Yes
33001	Why aren't you putting some money in?	No
35356	The war was not my favorite topic of discussion.	Yes
35901	Although Massachusetts has a small defense budget, the governor raised taxes five times.	Yes
5899	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	No
37117	He began his business with a donation of $14 million, which was borrowed from his father, and he believes that aiding the wealthy will bring about positive outcomes.	Yes
9760	We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	Yes
25088	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	Yes
37168	According to independent experts, the proposed plan could result in the creation of 10 million additional jobs.	Yes
6744	My opponent was against it.	No
12685	Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	No
26510	And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	Yes
28371	And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	No
20212	I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	No
37001	Compared to my administration as governor of Texas, they are now much more secure.	Yes
32877	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	Yes
31846	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	No
28808	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	No
37335	At present, the federal government is funding just 7% of the total education expenses.	Yes
22835	I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	No
3582	Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	Yes
35770	It's not true, Governor Romney.	Yes
35956	He has broken it three times in the past year.	Yes
36012	There is no reason for Americans to die, as Afghans are capable of defending their own country.	Yes
22112	Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	Yes
32427	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	No
37023	The largest increase in trade agreements and the proliferation of organized crime, along with efforts to expand America's economic influence globally, is one of the reasons why it has regained its position as leader in auto production.	Yes
15895	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	No
168	Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	No
29555	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	No
17892	Will our children be better off?	No
38503	America is safer, but the 9/11 Commission's report indicates that it is still unsafe.	Yes
29799	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	No
34788	I never suggested that Medicare receive a $20 billion budget, but I recommended that the program be addressed with this specific issue.	Yes
36617	Your goal was to locate him and even sent pictures of him dressed in a particular outfit, which were highly regarded.	Yes
37114	We often hear about the gross national product, and I believe that this Administration has achieved a growth rate of eleven percent in seven years compared to the previous Administration's total growth.	Yes
28782	That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	No
35678	At the beginning of the Korean War, Secretary Acheson gave a well-known speech at the Press Club, indicating that South Korea was beyond the United States' defense perimeter.	Yes
35087	I find it disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security sends checks monthly to tens of thousands of individuals who are being held in our institutions for crimes or mental illnesses, while a state institution provides care and assistance.	Yes
1111	I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	Yes
9916	I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	No
20050	See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	No
9047	And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	No
15924	It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	No
39492	They're utilizing inexpensive hand tools.	Yes
17896	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	No
39316	Over a period of ten years, the richest 1% will receive $665 billion.	Yes
30085	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	No
24403	Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	No
21414	People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	Yes
792	And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	No
13894	I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	Yes
37190	He expressed his support for compulsory arbitration when he first indicated in October of last year, as it could be one of the tools used by the president to prevent a national emergency strike.	Yes
36574	We expelled this individual from Kuwait.	Yes
12841	Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	No
38638	We doubled the fuel efficiency standards on cars for this reason.	Yes
34814	The defense budget was reduced by $3 billion due to Pentagon pressure, as evidenced by his own testimony in front of the Office of Management and Budget.	Yes
23620	And I have to make that judgment.	No
34874	I was at the forefront of the campaign to impose 100,000 police officers on American roads.	Yes
26788	The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	No
7036	If you're married, you got tax relief.	Yes
23032	I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	No
38526	The President's proposals have not been endorsed by the Congress, including the Republican party.	Yes
28092	And I believe I can.	No
4227	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	No
39396	By taking the lead, we were able to destroy the 4th largest army.	Yes
23267	I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	Yes
36441	The North Koreans were also engaged in bilateral discussions with him.	Yes
25837	We need to help people who are between jobs.	No
37998	The individual who crafted the Arizona law, rather than E-Verify, is his primary immigration consultant.	Yes
33867	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	Yes
11207	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	No
24520	#NAME?	No
3242	I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	No
36883	If a President is unaware of the recallability of submarine missiles and claims that 70% of our strategic forces are conventional, but discovers that most Soviet missile strikes were landing on land, their arms control efforts have been unsuccessful.	Yes
36681	In the opinion of Hillary, it is permissible to remove the baby from the mother's womb in the ninth month, just before delivery.	Yes
8444	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	Yes
36399	During Airbus' breach of international regulations and subsidies, this president failed to defend Boeing.	Yes
19647	I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	No
26244	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	No
1752	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	No
14720	It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	No
26373	He still believes it's a mistake.	No
26347	We had a better idea.	No
38999	We are collaborating with our Middle Eastern partners, who are predominantly Muslim nations.	Yes
10266	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	No
26254	Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	No
23040	And we're doing just that.	No
10249	We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	No
21362	Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	No
25811	That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	Yes
18349	Well, there are summits being held.	No
38741	The work that women do is equivalent to 76 cents per dollar, while men do the same amount.	Yes
13460	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	No
18807	It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	No
14368	So that's what I'll do as president.	No
24109	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	No
26029	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	No
8383	#NAME?	No
34104	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	No
34539	Mr. Bush extended his appreciation when I joined the Democratic party in advocating for the ability to negotiate a deal with Mexico.	Yes
34662	The Bureau of Census reports indicate that during Governor Carter's term as governor of Georgia, spending and employee spending increased by more than 50 percent.	Yes
39293	The truth is that he intends to push for the most significant tax reductions ever recorded, which are three times greater than those achieved during the Bush administration.	Yes
38558	Roughly one million people were lost in the war, which is commonly known as the Korean War.	Yes
17746	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	No
34582	I was not informed by Governor Reagan about his plans to halt or decrease terrorism in the future.	Yes
35144	The job is exceptionally well done by Innermountain Healthcare, Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic.	Yes
34404	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	No
28797	Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	No
28201	We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	No
18712	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	No
11652	In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	Yes
26391	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	No
11238	Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	No
14016	Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	No
7765	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	Yes
33825	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	Yes
16859	Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	Yes
37426	I defended my position and successfully passed a civil rights bill that offers protection against discrimination in the workplace.	Yes
37353	The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today that they made an error.	Yes
6562	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	No
2588	And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	No
34940	A fair society is not represented by Vice President Bush paying less taxes than the janitor who helps him.	Yes
22708	I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	No
298	They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	No
35175	I have resisted that as a senator.	Yes
37624	Although I haven't had the opportunity to serve in that capacity as a President, my experience as Governor of California, the most populous state in the United States, and having some decisions and moments where I felt disconnected from reality.	Yes
26971	You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	Yes
1397	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	No
17275	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	No
35846	The view held by Governor Romney is that we can achieve better results by cutting taxes, favoring the wealthy, and reducing regulations.	Yes
34974	Senator McCain referred to Henry Kissinger, one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, had just announced that they should meet with Iran without any preconditions.	Yes
22839	Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	Yes
14912	At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	Yes
23172	He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	No
35633	American planes are providing assistance for humanitarian relief in Sarajevo today.	Yes
12272	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	No
20296	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	No
32340	How do you do that?	No
17589	And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	Yes
1608	And we have not set an example for our own people.	No
7837	I'm very familiar with it.	No
8337	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	No
35719	It put an end to the idea that the polluters should cover the costs of toxic waste dumps, unless it was very recent.	Yes
2912	We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.	Yes
34615	FHA, a agency that was once highly responsible and sought after for home ownership, experienced squandering six million dollars in revenue last year.	Yes
37102	We sent welfare reform to the president three times, but he ultimately chose to change it next year, while the vice president used their veto power to do something else.	Yes
24041	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	Yes
20148	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	No
34991	As per the President's statement, the defense would be reduced by $60 billion and $112 billion.	Yes
34669	The deployment of more troops by him than any other president in history has accomplished.	Yes
487	One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	No
36133	A newcomer to the political landscape is Senator Obama, who recently requested $932 million in spending projects.	Yes
18334	My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	Yes
30112	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	No
25008	Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	No
33661	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	Yes
29219	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	No
35340	I've backed all the education initiatives.	Yes
512	That's the way you help people.	No
2277	As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	No
22963	I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	No
767	The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	No
4325	Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	No
13663	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	No
3208	And I believe that we used our skill.	No
26059	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	No
39483	As a policy, we must avoid banning individuals on the basis of their religion, as suggested by Donald.	Yes
14094	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	No
3751	It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	No
22281	We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	No
8179	Where, then, do we disagree?	No
10363	The president said he would.	No
39490	Our administration was responsible for the arrival of Mrs. Aquino.	Yes
15095	And I said, well, yes.	No
36937	There are 223,000 children in Arizona who do not have health insurance.	Yes
14970	The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	Yes
36329	After vetoing the tax-reduction bill that was passed by Congress in December 1975, he came back in January of this year and proposed a $10 billion tax reduction. However, it would be offset by an additional $6 billion in deductions for Social Security payments and unemployment compensation.	Yes
15662	And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	No
201	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	Yes
37459	A significant number of undocumented immigrants in America are paying higher federal income tax than billionaires.	Yes
28520	The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.	No
25530	National security and human rights must go together.	No
38806	MX's are not a necessary and advantageous weapons system for our defense posture, as we won't be spending billions on them.	Yes
7922	And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	No
884	The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	No
36667	In spite of my numerous public efforts to oppose the legalization of drugs and my steadfast beliefs.	Yes
37304	The annual cost is $20-25 billion, and I am eager to see it reduced.	Yes
7793	I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	No
26934	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	Yes
36018	Children who were part of Head Start are not faring any better by the time they reach third grade.	Yes
13820	For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	Yes
38677	The DNC's break-in by Russia is a secret to most people, according to me.	Yes
36169	Back in 1987, when President Reagan was still in office, he created a $100,000 advertisement in the New York Times and expressed that we were the world's laughingstock, just like NBC had been doing.	Yes
21765	And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	No
17747	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	No
18969	And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	No
39124	The absence of businesses and welfare recipients is the reason why they are not being taxed by the government.	Yes
14134	So the answer is I could do that.	No
35741	The Vietnamese had already sent people to Canada within a year of my application for the POW project by our government to plan the killing of me and my family.	Yes
1224	We have no energy policy.	Yes
29792	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	Yes
21342	Let me just mention three things very quickly.	No
36920	This is the most significant turnaround in the country's history.	Yes
36536	He has been the only president in 72 years to experience job losses, with a total of 1.6 million jobs being lost.	Yes
18332	They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	Yes
20255	That's not what I think.	No
34938	The news about Central America and our process caught my attention, and I hoped that our discussions would lead to a consensus with Mr. Mondale instead of arguing over it.	Yes
34635	No Child Left Behind was not funded by the president as he had previously stated.	Yes
38855	Our efforts to ensure that we were not paying providers more than they should have resulted in saving $716 billion through the Medicare program.	Yes
13660	He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	Yes
17386	We did, 25 percent across the board.	Yes
13350	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	No
1266	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	Yes
3914	But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	No
35821	The tax cut was split between those who paid two-thirds of the taxes and those with 50,000 down.	Yes
15241	The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	Yes
21632	But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	No
36445	However, as I stated earlier, the government's spending has decreased to 6 percent.	Yes
37197	Many people are aware that it is a criminal act.	Yes
2337	It wasn't thought through properly.	No
37273	Initially, I voted to close it in a tie-breaking manner, but then the House of Representatives majority went against my wishes.	Yes
36627	My record has remained consistent since 1965.	Yes
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
38578	The number of food stamps recipients has decreased from 32 million during the president's time in office to 47 million, with slower economic growth this year and last year compared to the previous year.	Yes
36771	It's accurate that this and CAFE are the same.	Yes
21009	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	No
437	Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	No
25836	But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	No
37871	Each person in this country spends six hundred dollars to cover the cost of healthcare, which includes healthcare for men, women, and children.	Yes
16505	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	No
26774	But we're not there yet.	No
25826	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	No
7995	You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	Yes
14739	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	No
39372	Health care expenses for the average citizen have risen by 64 percent, while tuition fees have increased by 35 percent and gasoline prices have surged by 30 percent.	Yes
12672	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	No
29848	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	No
13015	Not one of them selected a Communist government.	Yes
17394	I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	Yes
35660	Each of those nations is self-governing and has its own territorial boundaries, and the United States does not recognize that they are under the authority of the Soviet Union.	Yes
29514	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	No
38479	It is now present in over 30 countries.	Yes
12303	That's not the way I would have done it.	No
37556	According to Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to defy the rules in order to safeguard the country's honor.	Yes
6230	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	Yes
33178	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	No
2752	If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	No
13537	Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	No
35828	Northern Ireland is in a better position in the Middle East than it was four years ago.	Yes
37559	Our diplomatic relations and trade severance measures will result in the quarantine of our regime, which will allow the people of Cuba to take care of Mr. Castro.	Yes
3955	So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	No
19185	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	No
7466	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	No
86	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	No
15716	We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.	No
4028	And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	No
32536	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	Yes
37737	If you factor in employer-based health benefits tax and a refundable tax credit of $5,000, almost all American citizens who have the funds can use them to purchase insurance policies.	Yes
7781	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	Yes
9214	And we would have lost a million jobs.	Yes
25461	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	No
363	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	No
36495	I am being backed by him without any reservations.	Yes
38967	Without being able to overturn any of them, I vetoed 993 measures.	Yes
38454	Every fact checker and reporter who has examined it have declared this to be false, Governor.	Yes
27171	But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	No
25197	"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	No
25226	We have an arms race underway instead.	No
36309	It is morally unjustifiable to add trillions of dollars in debt every year.	Yes
34935	In the last seven years, we have built more houses than any other Administration and thirty percent more than the previous one.	Yes
3957	I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	No
35530	The most extensive expansion of private insurance occurred.	Yes
7897	And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	No
37945	Republicans are talking about it, but this administration is the first to use their program to reduce the deficit for four consecutive years.	Yes
8557	And I think we have a powerful country.	No
28512	Soldiers must understand why we're going.	No
19193	So some may be better off.	No
38723	The number of jobs created through our economic plan has increased to ten and a half million, as I mentioned earlier.	Yes
8466	And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	Yes
37364	In the process, we have achieved a net saving of $9 billion.	Yes
38903	Despite spending $89 billion on after-school programs for the top 1 percent of Americans, children were left without them last year.	Yes
84	And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	No
38246	It has been ongoing since then.	Yes
14725	On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	No
26175	My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	No
10271	The problem is they'll be in china.	No
3431	How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	No
38755	In 1955, the Soviet Union apologized to us for the occurrence in the Bering Sea.	Yes
36603	Due to the revival of the agricultural economy, there is a decline in farm payments.	Yes
19807	But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	No
3451	So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	No
300	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	No
38625	I proposed that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars each as part of my middle-income tax reduction initiative.	Yes
21107	But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	No
35665	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the past few years, with states also reducing Medicaid funding, including Arkansas.	Yes
35749	"Despite his complaints about the inadequate equipment of our troops, he rejected my $87 billion supplemental request and later released a remarkable political statement: ""I actually supported the proposed amount before I voted against it."""	Yes
18465	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	No
35059	At this point, we're below 285 again.	Yes
22861	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	No
26049	Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	Yes
34716	Upon my realization, I'll be paying taxes in the hundreds of millions of dollars.	Yes
34753	It is the Internal Revenue Service's responsibility to calculate that we are not accumulating tax debts exceeding $100 billion in this state.	Yes
25350	But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	Yes
20390	He said all poor seniors.	No
7042	And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	Yes
28082	They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	Yes
26418	We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	Yes
34726	I vetoed the budget that you passed, which meant that Headstart would lose 50,000 children.	Yes
36303	Nevertheless, I am confident that we have unexplored energy sources.	Yes
36729	Her current intention is to enter into the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	Yes
22691	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	No
3616	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	Yes
27263	And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	No
11200	It is the same overall strategy.	No
6405	It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	No
35804	My state has been the top performer in job growth, manufacturing, income growth and poverty reduction, ranking 4th in the nation this year.	Yes
12881	They want to be free.	No
35823	Married couples can avail tax relief.	Yes
1252	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	Yes
26365	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	Yes
38039	The time required for the individuals responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so is approximately four minutes after receiving the order.	Yes
36195	In the past 30 months, we have added 5 million jobs in the private sector.	Yes
19380	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	No
29241	Five million people lost their homes.	Yes
36325	Their preference lies in its lack of granting physicians and nurses decision-making authority, providing them with the option to appeal to non-HMO or insurance companies, eliminating the need to call an HMO before reaching 911, permitting access to specialist care, and having bipartisan support.	Yes
13605	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	No
4307	But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	Yes
188	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	No
10390	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	No
6077	We need to have more community health centers.	No
11867	Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	No
29611	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	No
38915	Our containers entering this country today are not inspected, which is why 95% of them were.	Yes
35374	The worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression befell President Obama upon his inauguration.	Yes
21010	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	No
3160	This has got to be stopped.	No
35861	The repeal of the minimum wage is one of several ideas, and Governor Reagan has repeatedly stated that it is the primary reason for unemployment.	Yes
37133	The trade increases by approximately 12% each year.	Yes
34175	We need to go after the leadership.	No
37652	A $550 billion tax plan will create a significant deficit, increase interest rates, and slow the economy down, while also increasing the cost of home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments for college loans, small business loans.	Yes
34583	Governor Reagan didn't offer any advice on how he would prevent or diminish terrorism in the future.	Yes
36019	By the third grade, children who were enrolled in Head Start do not fare any better than those who are not.	Yes
27246	The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	Yes
16833	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	No
36374	Your husband's endorsement of NAFTA was one of the worst occurrences in the manufacturing sector.	Yes
15604	I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	No
37855	Whenever I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court, I was assigned to fill five of the seven vacancies and approximately half of all court of appeals judges and about 35 percent of trial judges.	Yes
38327	The grain embargo was not supported by me in my administration.	Yes
37071	The Senator Dole opposed student loan programs, voted against Headstart and opposed the creation of the Department of Education.	Yes
2631	And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	No
1589	Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	No
39283	Our current unemployment rate of 22 million new jobs and the lowest in history for African-Americans and Latin Americans are a stark contrast to high unemployment.	Yes
20896	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	No
36838	Eight nations have departed from it.	Yes
26758	You see it in the church burnings.	No
37942	The dislocation of millions has affected those in Syria and the millions who have migrated from Syria.	Yes
20133	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	No
17002	We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	No
11053	We are a force of good in the world.	No
28711	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	No
94	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	Yes
25831	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	Yes
27922	When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	Yes
12297	That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	No
26730	It's God's will, it'll happen.	No
16504	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	Yes
7863	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	No
35780	I thought I had no idea, but after consulting with experts, they informed me that it would cause disruption for 12 to 15 years.	Yes
37097	Approximately 5 billion more would be required to fully fund Head Start.	Yes
33095	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	No
18531	I think my plan is better.	No
21549	Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	No
21678	Do you want jobs in the inner city?	No
37129	By implementing the BTU tax, we were responsible for raising taxes by $265 billion and paying $35 million for gas.	Yes
21491	Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	No
15305	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	Yes
18672	And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	No
13664	Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	No
2018	Well, the economy is still growing slow.	Yes
948	I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	No
17755	And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	No
1093	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	No
13741	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	No
22580	The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	Yes
7800	Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	No
37791	Former Secretary of State Jim Baker, General Scowcroft, and others publicly urged the president to visit the United Nations, which was eventually followed by his decision to go on.	Yes
149	And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	No
17186	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	No
33404	We either have a border or we don't.	No
7812	We must stand for our ideals.	No
12993	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	Yes
18602	He has more of the same.	No
15882	I think the American people would appreciate that.	No
24619	"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	No
25552	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	No
14676	And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	Yes
15464	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	Yes
37745	My adversary once pleaded with me to pick me up and remove him from office within six months.	Yes
5543	That's 16 million jobs in America.	Yes
36602	The agricultural economy's revival is resulting in a decrease in farm payments.	Yes
37246	I was mistaken in my belief that the economy would be positively impacted by the tax compromise and Democratic tax increase.	Yes
25016	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	No
35462	The amount of VA funding that my predecessor increased is now double the amount he raised.	Yes
1667	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	No
6631	I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	No
26348	Now we have a majority and we get a president.	No
37709	A trillion-dollar debt will be created if you are elected again.	Yes
11679	But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	No
13866	They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	No
12359	I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	No
38876	The plan developed by Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina is the foundation of its success.	Yes
24802	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	No
37223	Guinea's independence was celebrated by the Soviet Ambassador on that day.	Yes
1497	So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	No
10112	#NAME?	No
17198	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	No
6832	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	No
36897	Nevertheless, let's begin with Somalia, where American citizens were pulled through the streets and 18 Americans were killed one day due to being held up for eight hours by rangers.	Yes
16719	But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	No
10983	I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	No
39317	The top 1% receive $665 billion within a decade.	Yes
35252	It has been four years, but we are now closer to achieving a nuclear Iran.	Yes
35858	In that situation, I believe they would not force us down as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
32010	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	Yes
22319	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	No
2327	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	No
24264	We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	No
32725	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	Yes
36582	The work I did has provided healthcare to hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members, while the law requiring more careful dosing has made it safer for children.	Yes
5790	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	No
15529	And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	No
4191	They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	No
15375	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	No
16345	And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	Yes
39348	A family of four with a combined income of $40,000 was granted tax relief amounting to approximately $1,700.	Yes
39012	Our collection of 35 cents is insufficient to meet our needs.	Yes
20042	I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	No
2972	We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	Yes
30431	And I don't deserve that.	No
16619	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	Yes
37268	The president, or Congress, has the authority to allocate one-third of the president's budget, which involves appropriating every penny and advising Presidents on their spending.	Yes
28944	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	Yes
8936	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	No
35561	To the best of my knowledge, Governor Carter has stated that he supports a $30 billion expenditure by the federal government on education.	Yes
35923	Despite higher incomes, Americans with higher wealth have experienced lower taxes.	Yes
18110	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	No
8185	this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	Yes
33595	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	No
35551	Under his plan, he predicts that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 than it is currently, according to his own analysis.	Yes
38606	Hillary is advocating for amnesty.	Yes
38524	Andrea, we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads on land, air, and sea.	Yes
36800	The Fed's political motive is evident when they maintain interest rates at this level.	Yes
22139	We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	No
31983	Mine are words, and his was action.	No
21746	Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	No
7337	This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	Yes
37028	I had to veto two civil rights quota bills because I don't support the notion of limiting people's participation in government or higher education.	Yes
11640	And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	No
15294	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	Yes
39087	The U.N. received our full cooperation in analyzing the sanction policy of the Bashir government in Sudan.	Yes
27596	But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	Yes
11531	But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	No
27601	"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	No
6320	Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	No
4332	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	No
33321	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	No
25369	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	No
38809	One of the unintended outcomes of Dodd-Frank is that.	Yes
38566	The No Child Left Behind Act assures that it will elevate standards.	Yes
13672	I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	No
34811	If insurance companies are spending more on administrative expenses and profits than on actual care, rebates will also be required.	Yes
6786	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	Yes
8531	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	No
18370	It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	No
38442	We spent $3 million on studying the DNA of bears in Montana.	Yes
34700	As long as their economy is plagued by extreme poverty and unemployment, they will seek out job opportunities in other countries.	Yes
6150	Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	Yes
35769	A substantial increase of roughly $.50 per gallon has been experienced since then, and a significant portion of it has trickled down to OPEC oil producers from within the nation.	Yes
36404	We failed to secure 850,000 tons of ammo.	Yes
35464	We employed the Senate Budget Committee's projections for a five-year period, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%, and we believe it can be eliminated under our proposal.	Yes
15871	They're not left or right.	No
19196	And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	No
36159	In Egypt, we were in favor of democracy.	Yes
39241	My dissatisfaction with the United States' lowest economic growth rate among major industrialized nations last year is not reflected in my thoughts.	Yes
21913	It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	No
26645	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	No
35285	My original suggestion was to examine every government agency and bureaucracy, which I had made many years ago.	Yes
13542	In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	No
16778	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	Yes
17403	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	No
9231	That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	No
1499	I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	No
39364	His vice presidential running mate was chosen by him after voting against most of the proposals, and there is one man who opposes them now.	Yes
16208	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	Yes
29828	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	No
17142	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	No
38103	It is true that we have a deficit of $263 billion.	Yes
39294	He has vetoed bills passed by Congress that do not meet the congressional budget guidelines, which would eliminate job opportunities for two million Americans.	Yes
26119	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	Yes
7144	Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	Yes
16636	And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	No
28538	But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	No
19695	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	No
2612	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	Yes
24579	If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	No
30325	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	No
20005	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	No
36731	Although I gave myself six months notice before the act's effective date, lawsuits can still be filed legally if they are not already in place.	Yes
12739	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	Yes
38046	The southern border has 1,000 more troops on patrol, but we are seeking 1,000 for the northern border.	Yes
2195	And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	No
18962	And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	No
39173	Texas is ranked 49th out of 50 in terms of health care for children.	Yes
38169	The House of Representatives was where we put it, and we passed it.	Yes
38957	Lastly, I want to reiterate that I have authorized and sanctioned more beautiful rivers and wilderness areas than any other president in the history of the United States.	Yes
35236	The same sales pitch that was used in 2001 and 2003 is being used by Governor Romney, resulting in the slowest job growth since 1990, moving from surplus to deficit, and ultimately causing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
37612	A plan that was both bipartisan and recently released was put forward by them.	Yes
11759	It needs to be available for emergency situations.	No

9422	Candy, it's not going to --	No
7729	And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	No
1555	"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	No
15210	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	No
16912	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	No
15593	That's not what we are going to do.	No
33285	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	No
17108	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	Yes
13927	We cannot lose those jobs.	No

38968	McDonnell Douglas is losing market share to Boeing due to the Europeans' excessive spending on Airbus, which they cannot compete with.	Yes
24502	But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	No
25629	And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	No
2332	Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	No
35644	Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that they have a group of twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to defend its own actions to the American people.	Yes

25244	I read his statement the other day.	No
35315	The number of murders and other crimes decreased under the mayor, as evidenced by a recent study.	Yes
13897	And let me say this.	No
34953	I've proposed a budget that exceeds my actual spending, as Senator McCain has already stated.	Yes
2549	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	No
19499	Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	No
28132	Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	Yes
10721	We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	No
36917	The tales they shared in August, September, and October were completely different from what they reported during the war's conclusion when they had to provide testimony.	Yes
37843	Margaret, I regret not raiding the pension fund of Massachusetts, and let you know that it wasn't my mistake, George.	Yes
856	I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	No
19711	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	No
35595	None of the nuclear weapons are being taken down.	Yes
20554	I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	No
18038	And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	No
89	I asked for and received the same briefing.	No
14719	I know we can do better.	No

16652	But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	Yes
27241	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	No
34462	I proposed during the second debate that I would take a few days off and travel to Washington to meet with you, as both parties are keen on working together in enterprise zones.	Yes
36569	Keep in mind that our troops are four times more numerous in Iraq than Afghanistan, where there was no 9/11 threat before the invasion.	Yes

32721	Let me tell you something.	No
27551	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	Yes
38679	This recovery year has resulted in a six and nine-tenths per cent increase, making it one of the highest rates globally.	Yes
23351	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	No
22887	It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	Yes
35200	The world's cocaine supply is currently at 50 percent.	Yes
13811	And all you hear about is how bad things are.	No

387	Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	No
34701	If their economy is characterized by severe poverty and unemployment, they will seek out job opportunities in other countries.	Yes
3136	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	No
1412	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	Yes

19859	Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	No
33097	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	No
12633	On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	Yes
29610	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	No

38756	In the final stages of his presidency, he was against President Carter's defense budget increase.	Yes
8213	A record is never something to stand on.	No
27668	Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	No
29517	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	No
448	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	No
9438	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	Yes

19433	And we have a responsibility.	No
2584	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	No

27492	There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	No
26160	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	No
35963	In a country that has had its worst economic years in 50 years and experienced heightened industrial production, I have witnessed the family values of individuals who are taking their own lives and working harder for less.	Yes

35114	I've outlined a comprehensive plan for clamping down on crime at home and overseas, increasing the number of drug enforcement officers, holding upcoming hemispheric summits with democratic neighbors and allies after January 20th to work together.	Yes

7436	And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	No
30145	And you're going to stop them?	No
38894	The middle class deserves some tax relief as those with annual incomes of $51,000 or less pay a disproportionate amount of federal taxes, which is why there are six payroll tax increases.	Yes

34857	Those with a fixed income of $8,000 in 1980 or 1979 may have been $500 above the poverty line, which could be why the numbers remain high.	Yes

22841	We were safer before President Bush came to office.	No
22235	Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	No
7833	So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	No
24938	I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	Yes
34842	We're once again engaged in a battle for control over Mosul.	Yes

34644	The population of Egypt is 80 million, whereas Libya's is only 6 million.	Yes
447	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	No
3105	He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
26811	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	Yes

18453	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	No
540	The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	Yes
14809	I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	No
24223	The plans are all over Washington.	No
6222	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	No
37660	During the course of seven years, we were engaged in a war in Korea that resulted in the deaths of thirty thousand American citizens.	Yes

3355	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	No

36783	We witnessed an 18 percent surge in housing starts.	Yes
37441	Hypothetically, if we assume that our economy is growing at the same rate as it was during President Johnson and President Kennedy, even before the War, and that unemployment will decrease to 4 to 5 percent by the end of the four-year period, regardless of whether unnecessary programs are eliminated or advertising is increased, then in those circumstances.

36135	Within the past 24 hours, there has been a decrease in violence.	Yes
36057	The reason why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board is because many people believe it will ensure the same level of progress as our tax system in brackets.	Yes
28721	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	No
38701	All in all, we achieved 25 percent of it.	Yes

4100	Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	Yes
12325	I think that we do.	No
37477	Compared to a year ago, our current import of oil from overseas is only about one-third lower.	Yes

1577	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	Yes
17204	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	No

7612	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	No

25261	Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
38607	Amnesty is what Hillary desires to happen.	Yes

17349	The American people want arms control.	No

1165	At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	No

11552	I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	No

29179	My father was a small-businessman.	No
99	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	No
24169	This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	Yes
38373	Proliferation has been a constant issue for me, and I have been actively fighting against it since my time in the Congress.	Yes
25848	It shouldn't happen in America.	No
3036	It's for their security as well as ours.	No
16606	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	No
36139	The Dole-Kemp economic plan is in place unless your home is valued at over 500,000 dollars.	Yes
13935	Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	No
31945	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	No
35999	His opponent claimed that they had already sanctioned Iran, as he stated.	Yes
35260	All retirees can expect to receive promised revenues that exceed Social Security expenses until 2015.	Yes
35971	We are a prominent industrial nation.	Yes
23244	Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	Yes
28119	I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	No
29147	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	No

37405	It's beyond his ability to declare that he has created health care for Americans, given that 5 million Americans have been denied their healthcare, with 96,000 of them in Missouri.	Yes
15431	And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	No
1515	That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	No
8205	What has happened to you?	No
37805	To put it simply, the cost of his program has been slashed to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million annually, exclusively for the military.	Yes
16127	I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	No
20165	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	No
17777	"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"	No
36906	And that's just a matter of opinion.	Yes
13703	So we've got to do that.	No
23608	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	No
18745	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	No
3363	I believe we can and we ought to.	No
18787	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	No
34518	Despite the guaranteed loans, we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as intermediaries for the student loan program during my presidency to make college education more affordable.	Yes
28984	Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	Yes
32040	... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	Yes
23332	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	Yes
17025	Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	No
38632	I think we need incentives for both individuals and businesses, and I believe the plan I've presented, which has broad support and consensus from several leading economists in the nation, is based on projections.	Yes
39086	Our involvement at the U.N. was significant in determining the sanction policy of the Bashir government in Sudan.	Yes
25683	I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	No
23023	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	No
18920	And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	No
2968	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	No
36437	The amount you've spent in Missouri is approximately $3,500.	Yes
35522	In November 1975, Governor Carter proposed a $15 billion reduction in the defense budget.	Yes
36155	The situation is not conducive to repeating the same events as when Mr. Bush visited Japan and the Japanese prime minister expressed his sympathy for the nation.	Yes
17614	And what did you do right after the election?	No
33983	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	Yes
13299	I disapprove of the issue.	No
2499	Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	No
15267	I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	Yes
36928	The number of jobs that have been lost in America has risen to 700,000 since the previous year.	Yes

12308	So long as people have input.	No
32154	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	No
11152	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	No
35851	He has urged the Congress to delay nonproliferation legislation until an $8 billion program for private industry to produce enriched uranium is established, even though Mr. Ford would not admit it.	Yes
38307	Within 6 years, my plan will be in place to balance the budget.	Yes
36976	The ability to take a brief hiatus for the birth of their child or due to illness has been granted to 12 million families without jeopardizing their employment.	Yes
27476	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	No
1345	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	No
36884	Despite some initial clashes in the Senate committees, the Treaty has never been brought to the floor for debate or vote.	Yes
31842	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	No
38265	The Perot prescription is flawed as most economists who have examined it believe that reducing the deficit at this rate quickly will lead to higher unemployment rates and a slowerdown in the economy.	Yes
24059	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	No
23395	You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	No
32271	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	Yes
28235	Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	No
12989	We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	Yes
38980	I'm attempting to rescue your Medicare, just as I did with a bipartisan commission that saved Social Security.	Yes
7020	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	Yes
963	They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	No
361	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	Yes
38532	A 60 percent reduction in the deficit has been achieved, leaving ten and a half million jobs available.	Yes
24379	And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	No
37655	We passed the transportation bill this year that is the furthest in the country since Eisenhower's interstate highway project, with $150 billion allocated for infrastructure improvements.	Yes
20905	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	No
18896	And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	Yes
29152	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	Yes
36841	This summer, however, Coast Guard cutters were stranded at the dock while they were not patrolling.	Yes
26052	And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	No
27198	They don't vote for war.	No
6098	Here's your fine -- zero.	No
23394	You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	No
11478	And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	No
5708	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	No
23204	We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	Yes
35603	Our intention to pass the O.A.S. was our motivation for completing the program that was suggested during the summer after ending the sugar agreement with Cuba.	Yes
25989	Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	No
8844	I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.	No
38476	Let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is increasing the taxes of taxpayers.	Yes
35165	If you earn over $25,000 per year, you may be subject to Medicare or an HMO or insurance plan with no restrictions on premiums, deductibles and other conditions.	Yes
1172	I'd say, several hundred of them.	No
36402	We had decreased it to roughly 13% in the second quarter.	Yes
8875	And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	No
14198	This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	No
23926	Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	No
3559	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	Yes
26710	This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	No
38609	He overlooks the fact that he will be taxing health benefits for the first time in his life.	Yes
21543	That's not specific in terms of a program.	No
12114	And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	Yes
18835	My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	Yes
1210	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	Yes
36631	Among the 3 of us, I have successfully balanced the government budget 12 times, proposed and passed campaign finance reform, advocated for public referendum lobbyist restrictions, and employed all the necessary methods to gather together with legislators so they can not only negotiate but challenge change.	Yes

28702	I was on my peroration.	No

39098	Even the selfless young man of Captain Khan in the United States Army, who fought for his country, has been targeted by Donald.	Yes
38656	The Arabs' pressure on Mr. Ford has led to his concession, which has resulted in the Arab countries agreeing to boycott American companies that engage in trade with Israel and have American Jews owning or managing American businesses.	Yes
33687	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	No
39211	As a matter of fact, depletion allowances are only available to those who have been involved in the oil spill, which is eighty percent of all associated depleted individuals, so you won't get much from revenue there unless you move to the region where he said it would be.	Yes
36623	Senator Dole's vote on $900 billion in tax increases is worth mentioning.	Yes
19981	This is about getting the economy moving again.	No
18928	It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	No
28392	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	Yes
2573	Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	No
37808	Our friends, the world, and America are at risk in 10 or 12 countries due to the extremist group that is currently active. A comprehensive strategy must be implemented to prevent this from happening again.	Yes
26970	You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	Yes
36387	Remember that there was a trillion-dollar debt before we arrived here.	Yes
38939	My strategy has been to resist spending beyond the financial capacity.	Yes
36507	It was unexpected that the Soviet Union believed they were relying more on missiles on land, which led to their decision to use all three.	Yes
20430	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	No
29382	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	No
2700	That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	No
11304	And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	No
17680	I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	No
20082	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	No
3374	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	No
14061	But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	Yes
28949	Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	Yes
37883	It's projected that 8 million individuals will switch from private to government insurance.	Yes
1320	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	No
36637	I'm annoyed by the fact that we're shielding them and they should be providing us with the payment they expect under the terms of their agreements.	Yes
35920	The issue of Social Security has been resolved through bipartisan legislation that is sound for the next century.	Yes
37844	The papers of Glaspie have been submitted to the US Senate.	Yes
28504	The governor proposes $45 billion.	Yes
7067	And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	No
24672	-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	No
35609	The president's invasion was accompanied by a greater capacity to manufacture weapons from 35 to 40 countries in the world than Saddam Hussein.	Yes
9705	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	Yes
26208	Because you got a big tax increase.	Yes
39487	Even now, they hold the top spot.	Yes
15799	I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	No
25077	I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	No
2513	I -- I have to respond to that.	No
37427	After winning the support of Congress, I passed a civil rights bill that provides protection against discrimination in employment.	Yes

36023	KILLED: Khalid Sheik Mohammed, mastermind of the September 11th attacks.	Yes
38697	During the Bush administration, Congress has spent less than a billion dollars on spending at the White House than it did before.	Yes
10497	I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	No
13316	We cannot have it in our hearts.	No
38938	I have resisted spending beyond limits.	Yes
33162	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	No
16749	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	No
36	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	No
33602	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	Yes
169	What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.	Yes
15536	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	No
11579	If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	No
37219	He pursued Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died while serving our country, claiming that their religion was the cause of their death.	Yes
21339	The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	No
17209	I don't want to hear them.	No
19864	And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	Yes
3001	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	Yes
36460	Despite their claim of having a plan, the administration has not released the remaining funds that were authorized by Congress.	Yes
12782	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	No
36738	Iraq alone incurred $200 billion in casualties and expenses, with the majority of it going to healthcare, schools, construction, and prescription drugs for senior citizens.	Yes
34006	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	Yes
20037	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	No

11818	But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	No
32499	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	Yes
35887	We refunded property taxpayers of $50 million in Georgia the year before my departure from office.	Yes

3309	This is uh - what the American people want.	No
19517	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	Yes
17128	What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	No

14533	Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	No
17978	All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	No
22476	Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	No
3316	This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	Yes
793	And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	No
38381	It adds up to 10 cents per year.	Yes
19404	But let's look at the overall record.	No
31888	I'm not proud of it.	No
5896	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	Yes
9389	I'm all for oil production.	No
19826	And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	No
7153	I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	No
33423	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	No
5987	Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	No
24717	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	No
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
6836	That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	No
33381	We either have -- and by the way...	No
23927	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	No
13495	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	No
37715	Last week, Senator McCain's campaign publicly stated that if we continue to discuss the economic crisis, we will lose, so it is crucial to change the topic.	Yes

6856	The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	Yes
35929	In Washington, D.C., we have a computer that lists 20 million people who are individuals who should not possess firearms.	Yes

239	But we got to have a knowledge base.	No
26990	I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.	No
8142	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	No
39145	After discussing the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico's president and Canada' Deputy Prime Minister, I am keen to see more of these agreements implemented as export jobs are growing at a faster pace than any jobs that may have been relocated overseas.	Yes
27495	But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	No
39028	Millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens have been killed by the hundreds of extra warheads constructed by both the United States and the Soviet Union since our discussion 2 weeks ago.	Yes

35898	The project will take place over a period of several years.	Yes
1070	We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	No
27760	It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.	Yes
9323	How much did you cut them by, then?	No
27801	And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	Yes
8002	Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	Yes
24841	The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	Yes
35075	We spend approximately $300 billion annually on defense, while the Japanese and Germans respectively spend around 30 billion in Europe and Asia.	Yes
27536	And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	No
34925	We apologized for flying over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	Yes
12368	It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.	No
35235	However, it has led to the possibility of reducing the education budget by up to 20 percent through extrapolating the actual amount of money invested.	Yes
57	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	No
13281	Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	Yes

27073	It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	No
22888	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	No

37256	In the last seven and a half years, we have generated more hydroelectric power than any other administration in history.	Yes
34950	To improve the coordination of our borders and ports, my administration collaborated with Congress to establish the Department of Homeland Security.	Yes

32163	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	Yes
1827	That is, I want to bring down rates.	No
25110	But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	Yes
23153	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	No
19944	I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	No

2224	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	No
38142	The majority of employers, up to 95 percent, and all employees they employ are not included in this bill.	Yes
7883	Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	No
35990	Donald's proposal to cut massive taxes will result in a $20 trillion national debt.	Yes
19484	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	Yes
22740	That was the right place.	No
1250	Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	No
3079	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	Yes
37339	The case was not pursued by our mayor, who had just been elected.	Yes
26349	That was a tax credit for the employer.	No
26428	We have a good, stable economic policy.	No
34287	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	No
2748	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	No
11209	So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	No
19574	It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	No

4353	We seem to come full circle again.	No
6526	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	No
1723	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	Yes
19140	We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	Yes

36739	In Iraq, we have received $200 billion in lost lives and the remaining portion of the cost. This money could have been used to pay for healthcare, education, construction, and prescription medication for senior citizens.	Yes
1029	If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	No
19290	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	Yes
28142	The governor talked about Medicare.	No
38635	During Nixon and Ford's administration, inflation has increased threefold compared to the previous presidents, including President Kennedy and former Democrats.	Yes

26266	You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	No
19963	They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	No
26352	But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	Yes
28335	94% comes from the local level.	Yes
13594	Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	No

20827	It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	No
1535	We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	Yes
18642	So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	No
11532	And we have maintained the sanctions.	Yes

36755	Their money is being used to escape our country due to bureaucratic obstacles and inability to reconcile.	Yes
19591	When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	No
3285	And let me make another observation.	No
21611	But there's going to be a new Congress.	No
15072	In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	Yes

36608	We made a trip to the UN, where we presented groundbreaking resolutions, and the entire world was united, but our Congress was struggling.	Yes
359	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	Yes
7467	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	No
16966	It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	No

13944	Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	No

17852	I promised a new beginning.	No
36864	Small businesses have created more than 300,000 jobs, which is a positive outcome.	Yes

No
25058	I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	No

7675	These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	No
9523	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	No
20631	That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	No
27796	I mean that's how our free market works.	No
3893	And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	Yes
17272	First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	No
35036	According to John's non-inflationary plan, there are 88 proposals that call for additional Government spending programs.	Yes
11418	And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	No
21167	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	No
25817	We've always had at least 7 percent.	Yes

15636	I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	Yes
15502	And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	No

16910	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	No
25487	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	No

7832	I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	No
749	We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	No
17870	Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	Yes
19128	And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	No
18834	There's nothing wrong with that.	No
26782	And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	No
1787	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	Yes
36535	We cannot ignore the fact that black and Hispanic youth in those cities are facing a 55% youth unemployment rate.	Yes

37280	He tallied 98 votes for tax hikes.	Yes
16126	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	No
15191	It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	No
36237	It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge that since 1969, during the Republican administrations, ten million individuals have been removed from the lower end of the taxpayer bracket.	Yes
976	And the best America is not behind us.	No
39144	I recently held discussions with both the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, and my objective is to obtain more of these agreements as export jobs are growing at a faster pace than jobs that may have been relocated overseas.	Yes
19492	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	No
33886	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	Yes
26766	So we want to end discrimination.	No
35495	Prior to my presidency, there were many manufacturing job losses in the 12 years that followed.	Yes
35766	The Duelfer report disclosed their work to us and the entire world yesterday, Mr. President.	Yes
26068	It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	Yes
35600	The crown jewel of his program was taken away last week due to a conference committee's rejection of the ambitious proposal made by him to increase loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	Yes
3690	We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	No
36061	My personal experience and religious beliefs are deeply personal to me, and I have publicly expressed my regret for attempting to put forward the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country.	Yes
33744	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	Yes
29646	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	Yes
38033	Up to 20 million individuals are expected to lose their insurance as Obamacare comes into effect next year, according to the CBO.	Yes
38549	The federal government's education spending has increased, which is a fact.	Yes
17093	Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	Yes
14867	I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	Yes
25444	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	Yes
886	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	No
25508	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	Yes
35257	The largest single tax increase in our country, the Social Security payroll tax hike, is the only solution available to balance out trillions of dollars and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years.	Yes
16531	Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	No
18137	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	Yes
33343	I don't want to rip families apart.	No
24239	I think the American people are ready for action.	No
36119	The number of unemployed Americans has increased by a factor of over five times from three months ago.	Yes
22619	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	No
10853	But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	No
7439	Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	No
34130	They want to look good.	No
37937	We went to the summit, but the Soviet Union's refusal was disastrous.	Yes
38795	The intention to repeal Dodd-Frank has been expressed by Governor Romney.	Yes
16134	So that's not where we ought to go.	No
12632	In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	No
12663	The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	No
38864	Volunteering necessitates a payment of approximately $27,000 per person.	Yes
35560	I believe Governor Carter has indicated that he supports a $30 billion expenditure by the federal government on education.	Yes
26773	And we're all proud of it.	No
32570	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	Yes
27084	They're willing to work with us.	Yes
16438	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	No
38234	The Washington Post reports that he has already spent $3 trillion on expenses related to his convention and campaign promises.	Yes
39154	I suggested a $28 billion tax cut to American businesses, with 25% of it going to individual taxpayers, Mr. Gannon.	Yes
26117	I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	No
28165	Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	No
21918	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	No
24498	Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	Yes
1112	Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	No
559	And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	No
27410	And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	No
10986	But it is certainly my responsibility.	No
21615	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	No
13007	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	No
38330	I received 84 percent of the vote in Georgia, and Governor Wallace was one of only fourteen people on the ballot.	Yes
13625	But not by raising taxes.	No
21694	I support the right to keep and bear arms.	No
19659	But it will cover preexisting conditions.	Yes
37860	I cast my ballot for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	Yes
21333	I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	No
3319	It's a matter of morality.	No
11173	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	No
17182	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	Yes
27335	There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	No
21308	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	No
37298	Despite General Petraeus' praise for the successes, he warned that they are fragile and would have been lost if we had set a specific date for withdrawal.	Yes
33143	Thank you very much, Chris.	No
27686	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	No
821	Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	No
36889	To be frank, I have never proposed the elimination of $15 billion in our defense budget.	Yes
26533	I think that would help.	No
36009	We were confronted with a high inflation rate of over 12 percent and soaring unemployment rates.	Yes
36734	The wall was the object of Hillary Clinton's desire.	Yes
17491	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	No
27196	And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	Yes
11288	The tensions will be ratcheted up.	No
18025	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	No
28173	Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	Yes
26806	Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	No
19818	I've reached out to people all my life.	No
7016	Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.	No
16588	When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	Yes
37374	The percentage of uninsured individuals in Texas has decreased, while the percentage is increasing in America.	Yes
32017	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	No
18985	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	No
33761	Let me ask a simple question.	No
32910	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	No
17507	And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
36072	In the next 10 years, we anticipate spending approximately $43 billion on enhancing our nation's transportation infrastructure through the windfall profits tax.	Yes
7760	But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	No
37257	The development of hydroelectric power in the past seven and a half years has exceeded that of any previous administration.	Yes
31920	We're going to make America safe again.	No
19413	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	Yes
409	We are serving a million more families now.	Yes
12927	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	Yes
35656	Two years ago, I mentioned that we are dealing with a sub-prime lending crisis.	Yes
37189	We were defeated in the Senate by a single vote, and we received our support from the Administration before being rejected.	Yes
38333	You have faced bankruptcy six times as a business owner.	Yes
38117	Iran receives highly advanced Spruance-class destroyers through their shipment, which are not being sent to our Navy.	Yes
11035	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	No
38610	The killing of 20 to 25 birds led to the imposition of a criminal act against migratory birds.	Yes
12477	I want to do something about Social Security.	No
508	Let me just give you one other example.	No
27042	But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	No
10801	And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	Yes
35837	Sen. Kennedy acknowledged that the United States is undoubtedly the most powerful military in the world, but we must still improve our strength to prevent any unexpected aggression from potential adversaries.	Yes
37003	We went over them, removed them and brought them back to our abode.	Yes
39362	The stock market was experiencing a downturn six months prior to my arrival.	Yes
39120	Our strong position brought an end to the civil war in the south of Indochina, and now the Communists have left.	Yes
14949	most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	No
36130	He has raised taxes on multiple occasions.	Yes
6478	Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.	No
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
1395	Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	No
19976	So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	No
8119	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	No
32443	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	Yes
20558	I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	No
23175	Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	Yes
29374	I'm very proud of it.	No
1006	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	No
23655	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	No
36121	As a member of the Woods Foundation's board, you and Mr. Ayers contributed $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
18623	Never wanted to commit troops.	No
38668	Interest rates have dropped by approximately 9 or 10 points and must likely continue to decrease.	Yes
8029	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	No
29274	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	Yes
22729	I know how these people think.	No
33541	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	No
62	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	No
37940	In your first year, you announced your plan to file a bill four years ago.	Yes
29775	Now, I believe in community policing.	No
37558	By cutting off trade and diplomatic relations, we will quarantine the regime in order to ensure that Mr. Castro is taken care of by the people of Cuba.	Yes
36639	It was Senator Obama who voted for it, not me.	Yes
730	That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	Yes
16568	I do not agree with that point of view.	No
18013	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	No
20583	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	No
25245	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	No
20324	No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	No
8445	I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	No
36478	What is more ethical in foreign policy than allowing the administration to lead the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974, where the United States committed six million metric tons of food, with over 60% of it going to underdeveloped countries?	Yes
14869	Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	Yes
27703	Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	No
16532	The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	No
7526	And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	No
25626	I remember driving down the California coast one day.	No
17560	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	No
16560	It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	No
7519	In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	No
36263	A vast number of people, totaling millions, are waiting in line to adopt children who cannot be taken in any other way.	Yes
24616	"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	No
11838	And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	Yes
34142	They say, what do we need this for?	No
12121	I want a smaller and smarter government.	No
28742	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	No
35113	It should be noted that we have allocated five times more funds to Latin America than the previous Administration, including an additional two billion dollars for the Export-Import Bank and a new billion-dollar bank.	Yes
39291	The overwhelming influx of cheap foreign imports in the country has resulted in over 3 million jobs being lost, making it the worst year in American history for farmers.	Yes
32472	I wish you would have done this.	No
8200	The same is true of highways.	Yes
14768	And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	No
37465	In a recent study, it was suggested that the north polar ice cap will be completely removed from the planet in 50 years during summer.	Yes
32461	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	No
14473	Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	Yes
34856	The reason why the numbers are still so high is that in 1980 or 1979, a person earning $8,000 was $500 more than the poverty line.	Yes
38027	The issue, Mr. Bush, is that you have cut 90 percent of our commitment to providing affordable housing for families with low and moderate income.	Yes
7849	Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	No
39242	The airline industry has been ravaged by negative events caused by leverage buyouts.	Yes
11846	We've got one in Texas.	No
36319	The last 3 percent of businesses in the United States employ half or all of the employees in small businesses.	Yes
25322	And I supported this bill.	Yes
35002	The most stringent regulations result in a significant increase in gun violence.	Yes
13010	But let's look at it.	No
36949	Today, there is more American workers than ever before in history, and the percentage of those employed is higher.	Yes
33494	Hillary, you have no idea.	No
32645	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	No
21148	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	No
29149	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	No
6472	I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	No
22138	I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	No
24698	Costs will continue to spiral.	No
3784	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	Yes
19553	But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	No
13504	We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	No
18560	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	Yes
1082	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	No
34741	In December 1974, shortly after becoming president, I met with General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and proposed a common limit on ballistic missile launchers at twenty-four hundred. This would necessitate reducing the launcher stocks that the Soviet Union currently has or will have.	Yes
25900	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	No
27784	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	No
139	Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	Yes
3805	And we will come home with victory and with honor.	No
35453	Those who earned 185 percent of the national poverty line were also receiving government assistance, as we discovered.	Yes
14100	Now give me 1 second...	No
37996	The bill has not yet been presented to the Oval Office, so I am unable to make any statements on it for tonight.	Yes
17615	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	Yes
16109	That is absolutely not true.	No
17959	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	No
14475	Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	Yes
11664	I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.	No
8937	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	Yes
38216	The technology to accomplish that is being developed for us is worth $1 billion.	Yes
11994	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	No
36762	Our progress has shifted from the largest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	Yes
28837	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	No
19092	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	No
3082	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	No
24313	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	No
1975	And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	Yes
1657	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	No
22721	We're going to train troops, and we are.	No
34770	We governed spending in that manner.	Yes
19768	And I don't intend to politicize it.	No
37543	There has been no endorsement of a presidential candidate by them.	Yes
9045	We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	No
38958	Israel had previously received 75 percent of the vote.	Yes
10648	And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	Yes
362	We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	No
25075	There's a big difference between the two of us.	No
36377	Iran was not subjected to the sanctions by my administration.	Yes
36083	There are no loans from Russia that I have.	Yes
1814	I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	No
38480	The budget was reduced by $270 billion in Medicare and the national guarantee of healthcare for poor children, families with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, and impoverished pregnant women.	Yes
37204	To aid humanitarian relief efforts, we dispatched troops to Rwanda.	Yes
13363	Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	Yes
28741	And that is the current campaign financing system.	No
35632	Today, American planes are providing assistance for humanitarian relief in Sarajevo.	Yes
35424	He affirms that he gave his consent to the resolution.	Yes
15114	And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	Yes
36498	During the Reagan-Bush administration, there were six payroll taxes increases, leading to a decrease in income for middle-class individuals with $52,000 or lower.	Yes
34744	We are shipping arms to Iran and Saudi Arabia, with a total cost of approximately $7.5 billion, as well as an estimated $700 million in additional funding.	Yes
34738	This year, he refused to approve tax cuts for the middle class.	Yes
27411	And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	No
29990	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	Yes
19850	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	No
26483	Let me just give you one tiny example.	No
38343	If you're poor, they pay all the money.	Yes
9031	I happen to believe it is.	No
26061	You can be on welfare.	No
35191	Your plan was to reduce the deficit by half, as stated.	Yes
22727	Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	No
32865	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	No

22411	I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	No
35711	The Strategic Defense Initiative has been established by you, followed by an agency's launch and a discussion on deployment with earmarked funds of approximately $30 billion.	Yes
7593	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	No
38642	The social security system provides financial support for seventeen million Americans who live above sixty-five and cannot sustain themselves independently, but they can manage it with an average check of seventy-eight dollars per month.	Yes
3987	Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	No
27093	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	No
37366	I've been lending a hand to those and understand how to improve the economy, cut down on our dependence on foreign oil, and avoid sending $700 billion overseas each year.	Yes
37076	Our military possesses the most formidable strength in world history.	Yes
15749	And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	No
27904	People will look it up.	No
33100	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	No
37891	Allow me to outline my own plan for cutting the deficit, as a CEO who has successfully managed ten consecutive budgets, and I have had to make both tough and difficult choices.	Yes
16348	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	No
13020	What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	No
1394	Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	No

39240	I'm dissatisfied with the United States' lowest economic growth rate among major industrialized nations last year.	Yes
1969	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	No
12634	The rest either abstained or voted against us.	Yes

35498	The legal deductions are deductible when computing taxes, and the 1-year period was spent by him.	Yes
13950	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	No
7990	Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	Yes
30163	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	No
18301	The president and I have always agreed on that.	No
28242	I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	No

5806	And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	No
32489	We are going to be thriving again.	No

34970	After the recession ended, the president requested a second tax cut and committed to creating 5.6 million jobs.	Yes
9071	I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	No
14992	"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	No
403	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	No
22414	No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	No

8240	It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	No
28332	So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	No
27584	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	No
24801	Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	No
9085	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	No

3188	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	Yes
17024	It calls for more of the same.	No
20822	A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	No

14683	"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."	Yes
18404	What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	No
2032	Well, we've had this discussion before.	No
21556	But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	No
32161	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	Yes

19188	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	No
19466	The administration says they support the instant check.	Yes
1978	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
2147	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	Yes
25040	He's 3 years into this administration.	No
14301	But look who's around with him there.	No
13261	Now, why did they reject it?	No
28363	This is a big spender.	No
25707	Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	No
21214	I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	No
21976	What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	No
17123	It was $200 billion deficit instead.	Yes
37821	In urban areas, poverty is currently affecting 45 percent of the African-American population.	Yes
34339	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	No
38827	A man who is leaving 50 million Americans without tax relief is in stark contrast to that.	Yes
33057	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	Yes
13393	I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	No
24570	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	No
15194	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	No

31864	We had an $800 billion deficit.	Yes

37082	She lied during the last debate because she claimed to have never mentioned the gold standard, as hinted.	Yes
31959	I am going to help the inner cities.	No
16543	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	Yes
19670	I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	Yes
29746	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	No
23609	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	No
35740	Within a year of my request to participate in the POW project, the Vietnamese had already sent me and my family to Canada to plan for their eventual slaughter.	Yes
10915	And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	No
4120	President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	Yes
23106	Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	No
21459	And everything in there says what I am for.	No
13109	This is the history of dealing with dictators.	No
3207	So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	No
13442	I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	No
18270	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	No
39171	This year, the Republican Congress witnessed a surge in student loans, going from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	Yes
34140	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	No
10037	You know that I mean what I say.	No
34703	There is no PAC money available for me to use.	Yes
37460	In his economic proposal, Senator McCain is emphasizing the importance of providing $200 billion in new tax incentives to some of America's most affluent businesses.	Yes
25570	Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	No
35933	There has been a steady increase in job opportunities over the past few years, and we are now seeing some wage growth.	Yes
34507	He endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, which was one of the most tragic and incorrect foreign policy decisions we've ever made in our country and encouraged others to take hostage.	Yes
24237	But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	No
9046	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	No
36074	Yet, it's been that way for a year.	Yes
36231	In the 4-year timeframe, there has been no increase in spending on the domestic side of the budget, which is represented by a constant dollar amount.	Yes
24435	I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	No
16621	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	No
34055	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	Yes
16604	The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	No
9055	That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	No
3825	We took our eye off the ball.	No
12988	We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	Yes
2914	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
37602	The governor's strategy involves redirecting 1 out of every $6 being invested in stocks, which would result in a trillion dollars being depleted from the Social Security Trust Fund over the next decade, and Social Safety will go bankrupt under that plan.	Yes
27267	New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	Yes
36157	As a matter of fact, our trade imbalance with China is much larger than it is with us and continues to grow annually.	Yes

30363	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	Yes
24836	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	No
28426	Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	Yes
13841	I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	No
38801	His former treasury secretary's campaign manager was taking credit for hiring internal revenue agents to raise substantial funds from Congress, much like his predecessor Jim Baker.	Yes
29022	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	No
38471	While I wasn't a lawyer, I was the governor of Georgia and we oversaw the complete overhaul of the court system in the state.	Yes
20019	And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	No
9448	The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	Yes
20546	They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	No
14342	And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	No
39307	Every measure I supported against Iran during my time in the Senate was not enough.	Yes
36646	The communications industry is now our area of focus.	Yes
38240	The Kassebaum bill had several provisions that included deductions for long-term care, allowing self-employed individuals to deduct 80 percent of their premium payments.	Yes
621	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	No

33651	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	No
38740	Men and women both earn 76 cents on the dollar for their work.	Yes
34745	Currently, we are shipping arms to Iran and Saudi Arabia worth approximately $700 million, or roughly $7 billion.	Yes
30371	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	No
6866	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	Yes
35139	The number of military personnel has been decreased by one million four hundred thousand.	Yes
29434	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	No
20112	But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	No
31961	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	No
34729	In the beginning, we have made a significant reduction in defense spending.	Yes
25253	I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	No
34740	Upon my election to the presidency in December 1974, I met with General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and reached an agreement to cap the number of ballistic missile launchers at twenty-four hundred, which would require the Soviet Union to reduce their current or planned launcher fleets.	Yes
36173	The NIH's budget for discovering cures was doubled to $28 billion per year thanks to my intervention.	Yes
35312	Mr. Ford repaid one and a half billion dollars with the help of Ronald Reagan's victory in the Texas primary election.	Yes

39153	A 25 percent reduction in Social Security was the goal of the President's budget, as they had emphasized.	Yes
12751	"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."	No

20663	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	Yes
9666	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	No
3154	Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	Yes
38418	We put forward a regulation six months after my election as President, in accordance with the law he mentioned.	Yes
21070	I am opposed to it.	No
36438	The assault weapons ban in the Senate was met with strong opposition from Senator Dole, who nearly quashed the crime bill by opposing it because the National Rifle Association opposed it, much like they did with the Brady Bill.	Yes
23542	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	Yes
34660	Parents and children who are earning for themselves can receive a $4,000 tuition tax credit to cover their college expenses.	Yes
11929	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	No
11242	You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	Yes
38093	In 1992, we had a bill that required all states to comply with it or risk losing money.	Yes

8070	The people have to make up their minds.	No
27233	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	No
20694	We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	No
33693	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	Yes
8362	There's no certain road to the presidency.	No
20784	And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	Yes
12020	He is for registration of guns.	Yes
3060	In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	No
17097	In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	Yes
9015	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	No
3666	And that's just a fact.	Yes
37541	Mayor Bloomberg has recently implemented a spending freeze across the country for New York City.	Yes
34143	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	No
22783	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	No
741	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	No
2861	And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	No
24978	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	No
36877	You were assured that Medicare and Social Security would be restructured.	Yes
38495	Although we have had the opportunity to witness the job in action, it is something that those of us who have worked in this field know how difficult it can be. This is not solely duets on the fact that my husband overcame a $300 billion deficit and added $200 billion in surplus while 23 million new jobs were created, leading to higher incomes for everyone.	Yes
16284	In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	No
35743	The complete extent of Senator Obama's association with ACORN, who could potentially perpetrate one of the most significant frauds in voter history and undermine democracy, needs to be uncovered.	Yes

34631	Soros, who is a friend of hers, made incredibly large sums of money.	Yes
35243	Political violence in Haiti is far less frequent compared to the past.	Yes
16518	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	No
38461	The governor, Carter, has publicly stated in an interview that he would raise taxes on approximately 50 percent of the working class to compensate for their income, which is around $14 thousand per person.	Yes
6037	And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	No
37702	The actions of President Clinton resulted in his impeachment and loss of his legal license.	Yes
23123	I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	No
13417	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	Yes
538	This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	No
8686	Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	No
2141	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	No
15182	And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	No
37555	This was largely due to tax policies that reduced taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in middle-class families, disengaged from Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	Yes
25315	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	Yes
27583	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	No
37888	A commission to eliminate loopholes in corporate giveaways is being proposed by John McCain and I.	Yes
7826	If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	No
23081	Now, he talks about Medicare.	No
37469	You didn't acknowledge the Administration's plan to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw from the islands over the past five years.	Yes
13872	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	No
36712	It's a rare occurrence for FOX News to dispute it, even when there are allegations about me.	Yes
38568	Vice President Gore's plan is distinct in the absence of any new accountability measures.	Yes
29236	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	Yes
25713	60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	Yes
35302	Families with no financial limit were still able to obtain low-interest college loans during the previous administration.	Yes
1829	And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	No
7605	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	Yes
13679	And I said I make a mistake.	No
35758	Despite efforts, the US Senate Republicans once again prevented the passage of a crime bill that would have addressed some of these issues.	Yes
38438	The average income has decreased by $1600 in the past two years, with 2–3rds of our population working harder for less than 10 years.	Yes
39132	A pair of police officers lost their lives today after being shot.	Yes
3567	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	No
128	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	No
36876	The promise was made to you that Medicare and Social Security would be reformed.	Yes
36249	The source of their origin is unknown to them.	Yes
18470	As the politics change, his positions change.	No
37666	$20 trillion in debt is too much to handle.	Yes
36740	We're transferring troops from Korea and equipping them with more potent weapons.	Yes
1452	We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	No
21049	I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	No
6197	But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	No
24673	And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	No
38573	The outside estimate is 5 billion if all tax reliefs are eliminated.	Yes
23636	My opponent voted against the ban.	Yes
18533	I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	No
36078	By overriding my vetoed bills, Congress has contributed approximately $13 billion to the federal deficit and expenses.	Yes
28310	We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	No
27740	Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	No
36440	He engaged in bilateral discussions with the North Koreans.	Yes
37407	There is currently no comprehensive energy program or policy in our country.	Yes
12970	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	No
36080	What actions will you take to ensure that people remember that you signed the most significant tax increase in both California and the United States?	Yes
28886	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	No
1740	This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	No
23197	I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	Yes
35334	In addition, they presented a suggestion that was adopted and utilized for the purpose of selecting all judges, district attorneys, or prosecuting attorneys based on their merit during my tenure.	Yes
37234	The defense budget has been raised, of course.	Yes
3484	So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	No
39149	These fake items, containing the serial number and packaging of a U.S. company that was created overseas, were being sold in our market and globally as if they were produced by terrorism or another country.	Yes
26114	We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	Yes
33069	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	No
3116	Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	Yes
32911	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	No
7061	I see it as a serious problem.	No
2909	In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	Yes
38267	We have caused a decline in our economy.	Yes
19606	Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	Yes
3639	Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	Yes
14818	I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	No
7419	We have to change that.	No
38420	The inspectors were removed, and the television cameras were also removed due to their lack of communication.	Yes
23166	I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	No
10695	I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	No
10143	We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	Yes
38085	The latest data from the third quarter of this year shows that inflation has hit a low level, at 7%, but it is clear that the inflationary threat is still pressing on us, not just spurring an increase in employment opportunities.	Yes
15581	No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	No
37109	We've reached the highest point ever in our country.	Yes
19636	This is a serious business.	No
14470	Now, in 1984 they were told.	No
22594	I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	No
38918	African-American incomes saw a 33 percent increase.	Yes
12852	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	No
3565	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	Yes
35246	Every proposal I've submitted to the Congress has been accompanied by it.	Yes
14434	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	Yes
36060	It was a personal decision for me and others to attempt to identify the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, which holds great significance in my religious beliefs.	Yes
2839	I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	No
26689	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	Yes
28781	What I cared about is could we work together.	No
37657	The inflation rate during Kennedy and Johnson's administration was roughly 2 percent, which is one-third of what it is under this administration.	Yes
16289	That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	No
18554	But I have a plan to do it.	No
11323	My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	No
36271	Businesses in America are currently paying the second highest tax rate globally.	Yes
38805	The fact that $100 billion in tax cuts are allocated to the wealthiest 1% on Medicare does not make him a strong candidate for the tax cut, according to my belief.	Yes
10658	I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	No
38626	I am honored to have the support of several military leaders who endorse my candidacy, including John Shalikashvili, General Eisenhower's son, and General Admiral William Crown.	Yes
7274	Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	No
37049	Our workforce is expanding alongside a significant increase in investment.	Yes
13099	As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	No
33959	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	No
38402	Despite the fact that you shouldn't have been in Iraq, you did vote for it.	Yes
11247	That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.	Yes
35084	We provide a cut of $2.50 for every reduction, and we request $1 in additional revenue by asking those who have done well in the country to contribute more to reduce the deficit.	Yes
28333	There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	No
31982	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	No
12819	There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	No
3005	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	No
37755	Your tax payment resulted in a 265 billion dollar increase.	Yes
6865	Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	No
26416	Let's look at the facts.	No
24988	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	No
22084	Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	Yes
37237	Since Dwight Eisenhower, the discretionary domestic budget has undergone its largest reduction.	Yes
14685	They don't want us talking about each other.	No
38163	Two hundred and seventy-eight were removed by us.	Yes
34757	The most significant thing happened subsequent to obtaining a subpoena.	Yes
12600	Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	Yes
10619	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	Yes
23305	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	No
14827	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	Yes
18982	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	No
38010	Every wealthy Middle Eastern nation is attempting to acquire nuclear weapons in that region.	Yes
8326	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	Yes
8834	We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	No
13766	I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	No
37340	This has not been resolved by Mr. Ford.	Yes
21849	So I want to keep the quality of health care.	No
39261	Russia's serious attack on Georgia is something he doesn't have knowledge of.	Yes
37183	Many of our citizens will comprehend the reduction in expenses when they examine the savings accrued to them during the Truman Administration, a period when government spending exceeded its borrowing capacity.	Yes
22115	Yes, we got problems at home.	No
12549	They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	No
14339	-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	Yes
12673	And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.	No
18039	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	Yes
16753	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	Yes
24411	I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	Yes
2930	The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	Yes
11131	We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	No
36410	A man I hold in high esteem, Congressman John Lewis, made an accusation last night that Sarah Palin and I were connected to the worst chapter of American history, which was segregation and church bombings.	Yes
11881	We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	No
24182	There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	No
4372	They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	Yes
7254	They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	No
21367	But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	No
38995	It is imperative to have fresh leadership and knowledge of the forces that drive change for us to be strong, and it is possible that the vice president can clarify his support for the arms trade with a terrorist nation and its association with Mr. Macros in Panama.	Yes
26283	There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	Yes
38130	The president initiated an apology tour, which included visits to Middle Eastern countries and criticized America.	Yes
27085	We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	No
13033	See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	No
8894	And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.	No
34264	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	Yes
35237	Governor Romney's strategy involves using the same sales pitch used in 2001 and 2003, resulting in slow job growth, deficits, and a financial crisis that culminated in the worst recession since World War II.	Yes
23670	Put a head fake on us.	No
10830	"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	No
38344	They conducted a factual investigation and concluded that I was correct.	Yes
35545	The Soviet Union's refusal to allow their military involvement led to negotiations being resumed on their terms, as Mr. Carter had already canceled several key projects such as the B-I bomber, MX, Trident submarine and cruise missile flights, and closed down the Missile Man production line.	Yes
38854	By ensuring that we weren't overcharging providers, we were able to avoid paying insurance companies more than they should by saving $716 billion in the Medicare program.	Yes
12464	I'm running to get some things done for America.	No
19152	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	Yes
11294	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	No
21840	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	Yes
36206	I was faced with a T trillion deficit upon entering the Oval Office.	Yes
12938	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	Yes
35457	Among the eleven, only one has been overridden.	Yes
9053	That we must cut back.	No
29669	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	No
35980	Governor Romney's definition of a small business is that it includes millionaires and billionaires.	Yes
35806	I've been working with the leaders mentioned by the president for 20 years, which is a long time in my career.	Yes
8525	We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	No
37180	A typical example, similar to many others, is the overthrow of an elected government and the establishment of a military dictatorship by this administration.	Yes
860	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	No
7708	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	No
32175	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	No
5837	And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	No
3048	We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	No
16501	As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	Yes
8011	We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	No
679	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	No
35515	Women are now living in poverty, with an increase of 3.5 million from the president's first term.	Yes
34795	They employed those weapons against their own people and committed murders by shooting down Americans.	Yes
24167	There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	Yes
14569	And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	Yes
25586	But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	No
25125	There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	No
35154	Chiang Kai-shek has been under our pressure as late as January 1959 to reduce the number of troops he currently has on them.	Yes
3911	But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	No
18600	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	No
21076	Now, Social Security has never done that.	Yes
30294	Nobody's ever seen that before.	No
37706	He cannot come here and declare that he has no future with the child owing to his insufficient financial support.	Yes
6849	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	No
38413	A new proposal has been put forward by the president, which would impose an extra $400 annually for the next 5 years.	Yes
38870	Will this be a nightmare scenario of world domination with atomic bomb proliferation not only in 5 countries but also in many smaller countries that have been allowed to develop their weapons due to failure of our top leaders to stop its spread?	Yes
37084	A few weeks ago, I was in my office and one of the top-ranking former Naval operations chiefs informed me about the shortage of 25,000 Chief Petty Officers.	Yes
17267	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	No
19893	You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	No
20489	Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	No
21383	And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	No
12394	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	No
876	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.	No
8784	But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	Yes
17859	Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	Yes
19054	We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	No
24829	Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	No
37019	Rather than that, it's gone up by that much.	Yes
38593	The August session witnessed the Rules Committee's four Republicans, along with two Democrats, voting against bringing forward the aid to education bill in the House.	Yes
14542	Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	Yes
21782	I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	No
9310	With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	Yes
22564	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	Yes
26082	I met that woman again.	No
25420	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	No
35803	Despite their recent independence, will Guinea and Ghana continue to be independent nations in the same way as they have always done under Communist rule?	Yes
13376	But Social Security is a tax.	No
19197	One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	No
36081	You signed the most significant tax hike in both California and the United States, and what actions will you take to honor this record?	Yes
36154	It's time to stop having incidents like this, where Mr. Bush visited Japan and the Japanese prime minister expressed empathy for our nation.	Yes
35229	He endorsed the amnesty program for undocumented immigrants in September 2003.	Yes
24448	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	No
9624	Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	No
37632	The secretary of state has been present at eighty committee hearings in the House and Senate over the years.	Yes
3687	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	Yes
25038	To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	No
4038	"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	Yes
30040	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	No
37291	The last eight years have seen us implementing safety measures that have made us more secure.	Yes
22458	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	No
34165	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	Yes
37440	Assuming our economy achieves the growth rate it did during President Johnson and President Kennedy, even before the Vietnam War, and assuming that unemployment will decrease to 4 to 5 percent by the end of the four-year period, regardless of whether unnecessary programs are eliminated or government spending is increased, we should be confident that this situation will not worsen.	Yes
23316	We've got all kinds of giveaways.	No
11518	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	No

25745	I appreciate the quote from the young man.	No
2242	We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	No
24039	But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	No
35686	Our entry was prompted by the ongoing war in Beirut between Israel and PLO terrorists, so forgive me if I'm being too kind.	Yes
28842	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	No
20080	And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	No
13619	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	Yes
15396	We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	No
9609	We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	Yes
23035	And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	No
6264	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	No
28412	But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	Yes
9074	Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	Yes
22918	And they're over there, not over here.	No
36342	The President's economic strategy calls for raising taxes to the extent that it will allow us to take away a significant amount of money from the public and balance the budget in that manner.	Yes
11043	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	Yes
4046	But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	No
29786	We need to have more second chance programs.	No
38412	Another proposal has been put forward by the president, which would impose an extra $400 annually for the next 5 years.	Yes
22631	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	No
1920	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	Yes
25918	The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	No
38722	I stated that our economic strategy would result in the creation of eight million jobs, while we have ten and a half million more.	Yes
36258	The Treasury has imposed an increased tax burden on farmers, resulting in the lowest farm income in many years.	Yes
36400	With a greater number of troops in 60 nations, they are the adversary.	Yes
3950	Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	Yes
38559	Approximately one million individuals perished in the forgotten Korean War.	Yes
17368	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	No
27038	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	No
35747	Copays will now be necessary for basic checkups that can help them maintain their health.	Yes
21498	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	Yes
7195	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	Yes
22889	We don't need mass armies anymore.	No
27125	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	No
6597	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	Yes
22450	And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	No
3479	And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	No
14592	Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	No
11885	Is anybody being discriminated against?	No
36811	He endorsed the idea of shutting down the government to deprive it of its funding for Planned Parenthood.	Yes
22623	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	Yes
19351	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	No
15420	As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	No
36561	The Senate, consisting of a majority in both the Democrats and Republicans, was correct in their rejection of Senator Kennedy's position in 1955 because I believe this is what they were doing.	Yes
28149	And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	No
26524	Now that's not a government takeover.	No
9086	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	No
35496	350 teachers have been laid off in St. Louis alone.	Yes
27593	In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	Yes
4157	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	No
33011	The question was about the Supreme Court.	No
34629	The unique circumstances and coalition we had helped to form allowed us to quickly stop the massacre in Libya.	Yes
25942	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	Yes
3577	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	Yes
38665	According to various reports from Congressional committees and the Rockefeller Brothers report, as well as other sources, the United States has experienced a decline in its military, political, scientific or industrial strength relative to that of the Soviet Union and Chinese Communists over the past eight years.	Yes
2460	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	Yes
33991	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	Yes
443	But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	No
17133	I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	No
6966	We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	No
8847	for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	No
25214	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	Yes
35870	It is my opinion that this Administration has not met the will of most members of Congress on two separate occasions through the implementation of bills.	Yes
35047	In addition, I think we need an agricultural policy that doesn't require the same expense of 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars per year that has been occurring for the past three or four years under this administration.	Yes
37397	My energy independence program has boosted solar energy research from around $84 million per year to about $170 million annually.	Yes
26603	You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	No
10053	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	No
7911	Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	No
26179	6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	Yes
38387	In the past decade, individuals who graduated from high schools between 18 and 24 years ago had higher earnings than those in their current circumstances.	Yes
36420	We have witnessed him insulting women.	Yes
11047	So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	No
24928	I have ordered an investigation.	Yes
5492	They're hurting, and they're angry.	No
35025	My opponent cast a ballot in favor of the ban.	Yes
39386	It's a fact that they did.	Yes
13024	Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	Yes
21126	And you know what, the issue is changing.	No
37152	My state has achieved a greater reduction in crime than any other industrial state in the United States, which is one of the reasons why.	Yes
21163	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	No
35422	John's observation about the shortage of non-commissioned officers in a draft today is instructive, as it would not provide training for draftees without them.	Yes
38057	I, as the president, have made it clear that we will not tamper with Social Security and will never target the recipient.	Yes
2301	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	No

27513	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	No
3077	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	Yes
3692	We've got to invest in science and technology.	No
37672	The sentiment has been shared by both Republicans and independents.	Yes
38431	Three and a half years were required.	Yes
37944	While the Republicans are talking about it, this administration is making history by implementing a program to reduce the deficit for four consecutive years.	Yes
27353	Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	Yes
35559	We aim to promote democracy in Pakistan and increase non-military aid to facilitate collaboration with them, while also requiring the targeting of militants.	Yes

30169	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	Yes
35588	I would have taken it across the country and invited every law enforcement officer in the nation to visit those lawmakers.	Yes
36743	I gave my vote to border security, and there are...	Yes
5885	Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.	No
2305	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	No
33467	If we got along well, that would be good.	No
12639	I have seen us ignore Africa.	No
34214	Which is a big mistake.	No
12230	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	Yes

25497	And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	No

12131	49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	Yes
8086	They do stand for something.	No
24240	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	No
15705	I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	No
11999	I think that measures like these are important.	No
6084	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	No

35205	The Wall Street Journal reported early this week that a task force led by him advocates for simplifying Social Security to address the impact of inflation.	Yes

39472	If Mr. Ford becomes president, his environmental agency has estimated that the unemployment rate will be 10 percent by 1978.	Yes
11913	I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	No

25486	I don't trust the Russians.	No
15280	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	Yes

7071	They're coming here to work.	No
33858	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	No

26521	How many of you like it?	No
21499	So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	No
32239	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	No
37753	A 50 percent tax credit is provided to small businesses that prioritize employee health insurance, as they are unable to finance it.	Yes
26605	I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	No
36128	Within the Soviet sphere of influence, Guinea and Ghana have moved their way, as has Cuba.	Yes

35572	Senator Dole was at the forefront of the opposition to the Brady Bill.	Yes
3113	I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	No
10118	But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	No
546	We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	No
20008	Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	Yes
34565	Nevertheless, he pursued a disabled journalist, ridiculed and impersonated him on national television.	Yes

24285	And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	No
2318	You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	Yes
15459	I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	Yes
20092	But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	No
32629	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	No
38684	That has never been done by Social Security in the past.	Yes
15346	So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	No
25927	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	No
12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	Yes
37669	Through my efforts, hundreds of thousands of children have the opportunity to be adopted.	Yes
21384	I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	Yes
38944	The presence of a student program in the Congo was over 300, which exceeded the government's capacity for Africa in 2008, so we have not moved as much.	Yes
889	Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	No
2562	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	No
18084	As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	No
19439	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	Yes
3523	The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	No
14461	But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	No
24699	And just remember this, folks.	No
35443	Throughout this campaign, I have consistently stated that I will not increase taxes for individuals earning less than $250,000.	Yes
19416	I think we all do.	No
24297	It's a very unstable situation.	No
23200	Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.	No
38170	In January 1975, he requested a tax reform that would increase taxes on low-and-middle-income individuals by $5.6 billion and decrease taxes for corporations and special interests by $6 and 6.5 billion.	Yes
34458	It's important to acknowledge that the 33,000 e-mails you erased, along with the two boxes of emails and other items taken from an office that are now missing, should be the primary focus of your apology.	Yes
35584	The cuts that the president had promised were not included in our budget, and he then doubled the amount.	Yes
38916	It's now below the tally of nine points and two percent in the first three months, and above the impressive 5 percent increase in just the other half.	Yes
9044	We spoke a multitude of tongues.	No
26234	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	No
34767	We are partnering with NATO, the world's longest-serving military alliance, to focus on counterterrorism.	Yes
20428	Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	Yes
19365	But I want to go back to 1965.	No
310	Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	No
36386	It's important to note that we were in a trillion-dollar debt before we arrived.	Yes
8687	But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	No
38797	We are receiving our product through imports from China, with Vietnam being a major contributor.	Yes
32343	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	No
13157	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	No
36117	It was mentioned that the DISC count was around 1.4 billion.	Yes
38659	Health care is provided to them as well.	Yes
35847	According to Governor Romney, cutting taxes, targeting the wealthy, and reducing regulations will result in better-paying jobs.	Yes
6054	So here's what my plan does.	No
1952	So I'll get rid of that.	No
3800	I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	No
16271	That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	No
23019	And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	No
37811	During her tenure as a senator in the United States, we witnessed that firsthand.	Yes
21082	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	Yes
2388	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	Yes
8117	If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	No
35768	The price of gasoline has surged by roughly $.50 per gallon since then, and a significant portion of it has been diverted to OPEC oil producers.	Yes
32563	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	No

37886	Over the past four years, there has been a 30 percent decrease in cocaine use in America, while casual drug use has decreased by 13 percent.	Yes
29965	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	Yes
39288	The waivers that we're approving are being reviewed across the board to ensure their compliance with the law.	Yes
34993	We have lowered inflation to roughly one-third of its previous level.	Yes
36431	75% of those surveyed stated that it lowers our probability of hiring people.	Yes
17088	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	Yes
37893	The belief that increasing taxes and fines for the middle class is the only way to turn this country around is not being realized, despite the fact that all Americans have experienced higher taxes in the 1980s and over the past 12 years.	Yes
34888	These are not make-up figures.	Yes
25772	I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	No
30274	I looked the other night.	No
34650	While campaigning in North Pittsburgh, I observed that the city's water mains had started leaking and there was no money available to fix the leakage.	Yes
27028	...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	No
38208	You emphasized the importance of not having a timeline in Afghanistan.	Yes
14916	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	Yes
36649	Her power in her office allowed her to earn a significant amount of money.	Yes
14845	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	No
33598	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	No
37131	The foreign ministers of France, Germany, and Great Britain worked closely with us to convey the message to the mullahs that it is necessary to abandon your nuclear programs if you want to be parting with the world of nations.	Yes
34534	During the early stages of my presidency, I suggested completely eliminating intermediate-range missiles, which was never before proposed by any previous administration. The Soviets had a 10 point advantage and still have one better advantage over the allies in Europe.	Yes
38334	Our belief is that the two lines will be balanced as we reduce the government spending, which has increased from 17 percent to 6 percent, and the economy's growth results in increased revenues for the Government without any higher taxes.	Yes
7905	I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	No
26787	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	No
22974	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	No
36598	Regardless of the tax cut I oppose in the election year, I am uncertain whether it would be the 10% across-the-board promised by my opponent in tonight's debate or the $27.5 billion promised on August 20th by President Carter.	Yes
36219	The level of surpluses has surpassed the greatest of the largest deficit.	Yes
34578	Six months from now, I had not made it clear that I would be bringing out the troops.	Yes
27630	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	No
11813	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	No
3976	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	Yes
658	We ought to say this is good.	No
23225	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	Yes
39265	It's a given that the people are aware that we haven't produced any more (inaudible) on federal land and waters.	Yes
16202	I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	No
39045	The discovery of $4 trillion of options to achieve a more balanced budget has not prevented us from experiencing annual deficits in the trillion-dollar range.	Yes
20202	I have questioned his proposals.	No
10315	That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	No
24555	And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	No
39312	There is no proof that the grain credits allocated to Iraq were converted into weapons.	Yes
35041	To give an example, the health sector currently comprises three hundred and twenty-two programs that are managed by eleven major departments and agencies, along with sixty advisory commissions.	Yes
35454	The Trump International is significantly under budget and ahead of schedule.	Yes
34592	Our workforce would have suffered a loss of one million jobs.	Yes
33909	I think that's been proven.	No
38994	To provide the necessary strength, it is imperative to have fresh leadership and familiarity with the forces of change, and I hope the vice president can clarify his backing for the arms trade in favor of Mr. Macros' involvement in Panama.	Yes
37094	By his own choice, the misery index has risen above 20% today, which I believe indicates something.	Yes
35063	In the first quarter of this year, due to the OPEC price hike, there was significant inflation pressure.	Yes
31940	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	Yes
37026	Our debt is now in the trillion-dollar range due to their ownership.	Yes
10259	I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	No
37063	In the United States of America, business owners pay 35 percent of their total business taxes, which is the second-highest in the world.	Yes
39365	He picked a candidate for vice president who had previously opposed most of the proposals and is now an opponent.	Yes
25136	In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	Yes
8077	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	No
11563	IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	No
13012	There are only three left.	Yes
9718	My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	No
35938	Prime Minister Rabin has stated that the Soviet Union's position in the Middle East is weaker now than it has been for many years.	Yes
7069	After all, I was a border governor for a while.	No
34546	The president was given a national intelligence assessment in July, which concluded that the worst-case scenario would involve civil war.	Yes
23037	There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	No
22086	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	Yes
39069	We have a military presence in many different parts of the world, which poses challenges.	Yes
36421	It's something we've seen him insult to women.	Yes
36310	Even though he speaks about No Child Left Behind, the president refused to invest $28 billion in the program to aid young people.	Yes
21725	We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	No
12614	What are freedom's chances in those areas?	No
33077	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	No
39146	The amount we spend on our military is greater than that of the next 10 countries combined, which are China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom.	Yes
19894	Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	No
17192	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	No
17717	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	No
34147	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	No
7906	I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	No
39320	Despite the negative ads about Donald Trump, you wouldn't alter it since these people provided you with money.	Yes
2496	It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	Yes
7733	Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	No
36145	Twenty agencies across the federal government are responsible for generating, controlling, sharing information on energy and its conservation.	Yes
8810	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	No
16443	Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	No
20723	Why haven't they done it in seven years?	No
1766	On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	Yes
11643	I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	No
36439	Senator Dole opposed the entire crime bill in the Senate when the assault weapons ban was being discussed, and she was almost able to bring down the bill due to the National Rifle Association's opposition to it, similar to their disapproval of the Brady Bill.	Yes
39017	Two and a half million more Americans are currently unemployed than when Mr. Ford was in office.	Yes
19551	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	Yes
27723	But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	No
11439	So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	No
3943	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	Yes
17811	But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	No
36338	The increase in spending was halved by us.	Yes
19671	Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	Yes
7692	The right to vote is basic.	No
24998	Now, they claim they're not.	Yes
7691	There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	Yes
23771	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	No
6734	And that's to be honored.	No
26933	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	Yes
25775	They were presidents at historic times.	No
37760	The poverty rate in inner cities is 45 percent.	Yes
36185	In Massachusetts, Governor Romney's collaboration with the Democratic Party resulted in the implementation of a similar model, which has been effective in other regions.	Yes
5891	Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	Yes
1972	And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.	Yes
24344	But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	No
11726	And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	No
19930	Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	No
920	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	No
31	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	No
19442	And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	Yes
11227	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	No
13421	But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	No
16199	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	No
38804	I doubt he will as his tax cut of $100 billion is the only one that benefits the wealthiest 1% under his plan.	Yes
16390	But we have enormous differences.	No
38529	I gave my consent to the proposal, which I believe provided teachers with better pay without any federal influence. However, Mr. Nixon and I disagreed on this issue, and his tie vote ultimately ended the agreement, resulting in defeat for the proposed measure.	Yes
4359	And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	No
3601	And I pay for every dime of it.	No
37514	The United States of America being the most expensive country for education, as you mentioned in our previous comments, necessitates reform.	Yes
12106	One, we need more community health centers.	No
25184	Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	No
38443	Our research on bears in Montana involved analyzing their DNA for $3 million.	Yes
36451	National registration of firearms is not my preference.	Yes
28688	We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	No
35829	The Middle East has brought us a better situation than we did four years ago in Northern Ireland.	Yes
8220	They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	No
26977	Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	No
8285	We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	Yes
37294	The commanders in Afghanistan and Admiral Mullen have acknowledged that our troops are not adequately prepared to handle Afghanistan, as we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	Yes
10818	We've got to sit down together across the table.	No
36914	I thought his record might lead us back to the things we knew from the old government, but he made it clear that deficits were not to be disregarded and claimed that they were beneficial for the economy by doubling the deficit and reducing unemployment.	Yes
9216	But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	No
3962	You don't say that out loud.	No
8878	That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.	No
12220	And they have not got it done.	Yes
15029	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	No
3238	Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	Yes
1662	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	No
78	But we also have to take demand seriously.	No
36785	As a result, our standing in Pakistan was diminished.	Yes
24051	I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	No
30058	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	No
19309	I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	Yes
1124	I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	No
36918	His objective is to provide the average CEO of the Fortune 500 with an extra $700,000 in tax relief.	Yes
37524	In Richmond, Virginia, we ran a program called Project Exile that focused on targeting individuals who were using firearms illegally, with the help of federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors.	Yes
27518	They must not develop nuclear capability.	No
35369	In reality, we halved the increase in spending.	Yes
34915	Today in the Los Angeles Times, Clyde Prestowitz, a life-long conservative Republican and one of President Reagan's top trade advisers, supported my candidacy by stating that I would adhere to naysayers and avoid rubber stamping everything done during the Bush administration.	Yes
19748	Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	No
32379	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	Yes
35855	In the meantime, we detain a suitcase in an Arab state located in the Middle East that had nuclear materials.	Yes
645	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	No
13993	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	No
34473	My proposal entails providing the president with alternative weapons to safeguard the national interest against potential national emergency strikes, in addition to the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	Yes
34895	The red line in the sand was crossed by him, and he made numerous errors.	Yes
33389	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	No
33503	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	No
34467	As a matter of fact, individuals earning above $50,000 did not receive the same percentage of tax relief as those with an additional 50,000 dollars.	Yes
37260	The report stated that the buildings in question are worth $3.9 billion, although it was not a bad story.	Yes
19936	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	No
38657	Following pressure from the Arabs, Mr. Ford has yielded and authorized a boycott of American companies that engage in trade with Israel or have American Jews owning or participating in management of such companies.	Yes
35107	Despite cutting taxes, the economy has seen a 25 percent increase in revenues over the past three years.	Yes
1419	And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	No
36521	I was recently endorsed by the 16,500 Border Patrol agents, who only gained my knowledge of the border.	Yes
11027	But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	No
1544	The American people are healed, are working together.	No
17326	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	No
13093	There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	Yes
36563	Under President Clinton, Secretary of State Bill Perry facilitated the negotiation.	Yes
18195	Anyway, that's for another debate.	No
3003	We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	No
27142	No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	No
10735	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	No
1004	Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	No
29580	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	No
25984	But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	No
10816	Social Security is not that tough.	No
20064	I have relatives on Medicare.	No
20551	And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	No
36732	The health care that is funded by them is government-funded.	Yes
1370	But that's as far as I would go with it.	No

6396	And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	No
35433	His economic message in 1980 suggested reducing productivity and gross national product while raising unemployment to contain inflation, as inflation had already exceeded 18% in January.	Yes
26213	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	No
2638	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
7109	Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	No
36863	Our care is prioritized on behalf of illegal immigrants, much like our medical staff.	Yes
38972	The recession that occurred in the country has led to a deficit.	Yes
16707	The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	Yes
38528	My vote for the proposal was in favor of it, as I believe it would have provided teachers with better pay without any federal influence. However, Mr. Nixon and I disagreed on this issue, and his tie vote ultimately ended the agreement, resulting in my defeat of the initiative.	Yes
12839	And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	No
14914	The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	No
25701	And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	No
33218	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	No
23857	We have got to have the courage to change.	No
36274	I am not a supporter of Assad, but he is the one who is taking action against ISIS.	Yes
22315	There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.	Yes
23708	That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	No
11787	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	No
17800	Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	Yes
35339	It's common for me to be twenty-six in two years.	Yes
19990	But I think there are personal differences.	No
35978	The Russian air force is making a concerted effort to destroy Aleppo and eliminate the Syrian rebels who are resisting the Assad government.	Yes
36749	Even though it was in 1973 when Donald began his career, the Justice Department sued him for racial discrimination by refusing to rent apartments in one of his developments exclusively to African-Americans. He made sure that those who worked for him were aware of this policy.	Yes
8236	It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	Yes
39234	The gun lobby and Donald are both in favor of this, but we currently have an excessive number of military-style weapons on the streets.	Yes
35917	Despite opposition, Hillary Clinton maintained her desire for the wall.	Yes
14896	The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	Yes
39147	Our military expenditures exceed those of the next 10 countries, including China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom.	Yes
9939	Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	No
26807	But I would just say this.	No
34837	Chris, the voter rolls contain millions of individuals who are registered to vote, and those who should not be on them can be found by scanning them.	Yes
5574	We're not going to do that in my administration.	No
36280	We were not able to capture bin Laden.	Yes
38800	A year ago, the former treasury secretary of his campaign manager was taking credit for hiring internal revenue agents to gather significant funds from Congress. I'm happy to agree with Jim Baker on this matter.	Yes
15965	And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	No
35505	UAW and the automobile industry leaders came to a consensus that auto emission standards should be modified.	Yes
16712	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	Yes

33040	They'll pay off our national debt.	No

38928	During his presidential campaign, President Kennedy stated that he was not seeking the presidency as a Catholic.	Yes
15163	Yes, I'd be glad to.	No
13385	Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	No

31896	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	No
6253	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	No
38785	If interest rates are raised, the stock market is the only thing that looks good, but it will come to a sudden stop.	Yes
19723	It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	No
29499	And we better be awfully careful.	No
29729	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	Yes
7810	This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	No
34718	His speech highlights a significant concept: convening ect to solve the problem in Iraq.	Yes
3988	And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	No
35300	Iran's sole Arab alligator is Syria.	Yes
9290	And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	No
23495	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	No
37884	We lowered taxes 19 times and managed our budget well.	Yes
37010	"Helen, I think that people are more likely to ask questions about trust when they observe Governor Clinton's tendency to use the word ""trust"" as a way of appeasing one group and then try to appease another group."	Yes
25218	And we know what happened.	No

18805	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	No
16785	Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.	No
37367	My support for those has enabled me to address the economy's issues, eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and refrain from sending $700 billion abroad each year.	Yes
20892	Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	No
9499	And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	No
32803	She called it the gold standard.	Yes
36010	The removal of loopholes and deductions that benefit the upper-income group does not account for $5 trillion in tax cuts or $2 trillion increase in military spending.	Yes
38211	In the current year's budget, I have included the addition of funds for the National Park Service.	Yes
27628	I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	No
35624	The President dispatched a team, headed by Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to convince Chiang Kai-shek to retreat from the two islands in the spring of fifty-five due to their vulnerability.	Yes
38044	Our latest report reveals that we are expanding and it's currently at approximately 1 percent.	Yes
23308	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	No
38622	The number of U.S. troops who died this past year was higher than ever since 2002.	Yes
39403	Our peace-keeping operations have cost us billions of dollars.	Yes
17004	It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	No
24588	But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	No
33394	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	Yes

14898	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	Yes
23951	I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	No
10624	And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	No
37282	This president's actions resulted in a fourfold increase in the rate of regulations.	Yes
26369	He said it was a mistake.	No
39213	The murderer will face two trials if a pregnant woman becomes pregnant and is murdered.	Yes

17788	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	Yes
22113	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	Yes
38885	The majority of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums is accounted for by that amount.	Yes
13197	And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	No
3294	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	Yes
38001	The Federal Reserve Board's announcement was that the supply of money would be limited to four to forty and a half, seven and seventeen, respectively.	Yes
29317	And I have been a secretary of state...	No
20916	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	Yes
34977	The amount of $40 billion is being directed towards Bermuda.	Yes

11947	I agree with that, and I did support that law.	No
19432	This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	No
35648	Our country is the richest in the world, and we are the only industrialized nation that didn't do it.	Yes
4319	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	No
25390	Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	No
24573	I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	No
11658	Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	No
29644	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	No
35934	If someone is caught with marijuanaweighing less than 125 pounds while living in San Diego, they may be compelled to return to Mexico, according to Mr. President.	Yes
35607	The north has North Korea, with the backing of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, who have a well-trained and well equipped military.	Yes
19415	Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	Yes
35193	You can present it on graphs and examine the studies conducted by various groups, but we are still experiencing a significant deficit after 4, 5, and 6 years.	Yes
13526	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	Yes
29600	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	Yes
13646	You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	No
6487	I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	No
30	Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	No
22108	I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	No
22650	Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	No
35752	I have already reduced taxes for 98 percent of families and also reduced small businesses 18 times through my tax plan.	Yes
19829	I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	No
27851	We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	No
33860	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	No
35470	I vetoed $16 billion in new spending, among other things.	Yes
24805	That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	No
36039	At the conclusion of a specific time frame, his representative had been instructed to surrender all rights to the Panama Canal Zone to its citizens.	Yes
7508	And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	No
37875	The energy policy proposed by Governor Reagan has already proven to be effective, and he intends to repeal or modify the windfall profits tax, return a significant portion of $227 billion to oil companies, abolish the Department of Energy, reduce the duration of our program for synthetic fuels, prioritize solar power over other options, emphasize nuclear power plants as primarily renewable sources of energy, etc.	Yes
37233	I was 8 years old when he committed horrific acts against a radical domestic group 40 years ago.	Yes
39192	The homeland security budget has been tripled from $10 billion to $30 billion, which is odd.	Yes
36957	I'm offering a tax reduction and health care to the greater part of America, which is 98%.	Yes

24342	"We said, ""Peace through strength,"" and it worked and the cold war is over."	No
35383	The report was given full authorization on July twelfth of this year.	Yes
26622	Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	Yes
10821	That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	No
10768	Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	Yes
22194	But she is absolutely right.	No
32023	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	No
36571	Over the last year, our Government has demolished millions of acres of public lands that were previously used for exploration and mineral exploration.	Yes
5578	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	No
7594	Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	No
13696	I'll give you an example.	No
23186	Right, thank you for that.	No
8858	The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	Yes
34037	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	Yes
23430	Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	No
17471	Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	No
17697	I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	No
25640	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	No
8695	I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	No
20166	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	No
34824	Nevertheless, she does not indicate that President Obama has deported millions of people in the current state of affairs.	Yes
30342	And it's a big problem.	No
38730	Americans' ability to afford health insurance is negatively impacted by rising co-payments, costs, and other expenses.	Yes
37846	Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, which involves producing 37 tons of yellow cake for their enriched uranium, has led to North Korea dropping from one bomb to four to seven.	Yes
18571	But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	No
8257	Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	No
39272	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	Yes
37444	The president's statement about the ability of young people to withdraw money from Social Security and deposit it in their own accounts was made.	Yes
35295	The mobilization of moderate forces within Syria is our primary objective, and we are also providing humanitarian aid and assistance to the opposition for organizing.	Yes
4271	And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.	No
21454	Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.	No
3284	Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	No
9824	It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	Yes
8807	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	No
23445	Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	Yes
27408	And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	No
16461	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	Yes
38399	It's unexpected that Governor Reagan in California raised the three largest tax increases in state history during his time in office.	Yes
12616	Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	Yes
37818	From the outset, I voted for the authority as I believed Saddam Hussein was a danger, and I accepted the intelligence.	Yes
18590	When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	No
34912	Recently, there have been allegations that I had a covert plan with the hostages.	Yes
25053	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	No
34398	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	No
1096	And I've told everything I know about it.	No
16385	Thank you, and God bless you.	No
36442	Our country ranks fifteenth in terms of infant mortality among all countries globally.	Yes
34656	Our efforts resulted in the establishment of 23 million new jobs.	Yes
33161	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	No
14188	That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	No
26528	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	No
38457	Army chief of staff, General Shinsheki, stated that several hundred thousand troops were necessary.	Yes
35101	It's important to note that I haven't supported the decision to reduce COLAs.	Yes
15307	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	No
8917	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	Yes
39407	In 2006 or later, Hillary Clinton made an effort to sway the construction of the wall.	Yes
39494	According to my adversary, we were without any comrades in the war.	Yes
5702	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	Yes
12446	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	No
7077	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	No
7876	Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	Yes
36043	My experience in California has shown that it's achievable and will likely result in a decrease in inflation.	Yes
8012	But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	No
2315	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	No
26565	Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	No
19650	The President was opposed to it in 1993.	Yes
22334	This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	No
28280	It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	Yes
37724	The proposed plan's net tax increase amounts to 60 to 80 billion dollars.	Yes
38220	The vote was split between 44% of Democrats and 11% Republicans.	Yes
35729	We have the most powerful military, and I will take all necessary measures to maintain that strength if I become president.	Yes
574	I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	Yes
38875	His initial statement is that he supports medical liability reform, especially for OB/GYNs.	Yes
8498	Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.	No
34557	My proposal suggests that the wealthy individuals would be required to pay 62% of taxes if they were to do so today.	Yes
37500	A net savings of $4 billion has been recorded.	Yes
36172	I assisted in doubling the NIH budget to $28 billion per year for discovering cures.	Yes
7091	The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	No
9899	And that's what we've done.	No
17031	In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	No
12452	And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	No
35921	Bipartisan legislation has addressed the issue of Social Security, and it remains a solid foundation for the next century.	Yes
25190	Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	No
35272	A massive grain embargo has caused a 20 percent decline in farm exports due to these economic policies.	Yes
35442	I have consistently emphasized that I will not increase taxes on individuals earning less than $250,000 during this campaign.	Yes
34732	I've been fighting for three months to get Congress to pass incentives for small businesses.	Yes
28396	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	No
36503	I'm not sure if it was a criminal or paternal matter, but the truth is that it cost $3 million in taxpayers' money.	Yes
29192	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	No
35034	Based on your estimates, deferring foreign income could result in savings of approximately $500 million.	Yes
37947	Our plan is to rescue some of the 33,000 lost lives each year.	Yes
19828	I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	No
8299	They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	No

39029	Two weeks ago, we discussed the need for more warheads, and now the United States and the Soviet Union have erected enough to kill millions of Americans and Soviet citizens.	Yes

23314	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	Yes
11497	One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	No
28319	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	No
19352	And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	No
36318	Nevertheless, the last 3 percent of businesses employ half or all of the individuals who work in small businesses.	Yes
24818	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	No

11280	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	No
38902	The top 1 percent of Americans received $89 billion in benefits last year, but children were deprived of after-school activities.	Yes
16038	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	No
37584	With the assistance of some troops, we were able to stabilize the situation and then remove them when the African Union arrived.	Yes
37923	Until the election was over, they buried it.	Yes
4238	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	No
37717	He doesn't rectify it for a decade.	Yes
21364	So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	No
34786	The reason we created the plan is to ensure that six million more American families do not pay taxes.	Yes
848	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	No

19375	You know, mine doesn't work that way.	No
20561	A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	No
23975	I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	Yes
37293	His plan now is to only tax the wealthy, as he has stated.	Yes
24143	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	No
5794	Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	Yes
38572	If all tax reliefs were to be abolished, the estimated value for the outside world would be 5 billion.	Yes
10542	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	Yes
13404	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	No
24034	Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	No
36273	It's only necessary to examine Michigan and Ohio, where numerous jobs and businesses are leaving their workforce.	Yes
38819	In relation to Cuba, Senator Kennedy expressed his belief that he had made a mistake by not advocating for free elections while in the country.	Yes
36921	The country has experienced its most significant turnaround in history.	Yes
32336	And we need to do our part.	No
14415	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	Yes
391	It will require some funds, John.	No
9403	So I get the last question -- last answer --	No
14939	And my economic plan calls for that.	No
12284	We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	No
37638	This record is the most liberal and high-spending one in the United States Senate.	Yes

25242	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	No
15419	And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	No
23105	And you'll find a tort reform plan.	No
35307	I did vote to close corporate loopholes when I was a senator.	Yes
20070	That's what this race is all about.	No
36855	For weeks, Donald criticized and insulted them for their religious beliefs.	Yes
8950	But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	Yes
13175	And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	Yes
14610	So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	No
17153	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	No
15925	But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	No
24359	The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	Yes
15644	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	No

38473	There are a significant number of new small businesses that we have.	Yes
39280	The deficit was halved in four years when I ran for president, but we achieved a 60 percent reduction.	Yes
11246	We tend to be reactive.	No
18098	And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	No
10150	But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.	No
26836	Could have a chance to serve as president.	No
17748	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	No
26981	Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	No
35022	According to Congressional committees, it is necessary to allocate roughly $10 billion for this purpose.	Yes
38689	According to a recent report, we have generated an additional 1.9 million jobs in the past 13 months.	Yes

3681	We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	No
1325	I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	No
38978	Medical liability issues are a significant concern.	Yes
39499	Today, 47 million people are utilizing food stamps.	Yes
36170	It is incorrect for individuals like Donald to disregard paying taxes, donating to our military, and investing in health and education.	Yes

38703	I'm sure you know General James, and the Air Force granted him a three-star admiral, which was the first of its kind in the history of the US Navy. As if that weren't enough, we were giving full credit to individuals who held positions of great responsibility within the Ford administration.	Yes
