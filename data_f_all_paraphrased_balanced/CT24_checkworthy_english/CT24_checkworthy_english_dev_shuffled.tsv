Yes
24794	It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.	No
6087	Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.	No
5783	Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.	No
10737	We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.	No
5990	But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.	Yes
10794	So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.	No
11203	We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.	No
7586	There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.	Yes
29325	Moreover, we've managed to lower inflation.	Yes
1406	Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.	No
9829	Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.	Yes
29122	Despite their efforts to lower taxes, he voted 127 times against it.	Yes
24031	I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts.	No
9836	Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.	Yes
10952	Well, thank you for the question.	No
27828	You can take a look at the op-ed...	No
29114	In the United States, the typical cost of a health care insurance plan is $5,800.	Yes
29190	The Federal, State, and Local Governments are taking $0.44 from every dollar earned, which is a problem caused by the Federal Government's preemptive role in taxing cities.	Yes
80	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	Yes
29057	We have governed with the most significant increase in government since the Great Society.	Yes
26076	We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.	Yes
7743	There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.	Yes
15167	To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.	No
11240	The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.	No
27986	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	Yes
8961	This is 1980 and not 1966.	No
1596	Now I don't know all the answers.	No
5947	I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.	No
10605	When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.	Yes
29333	At the moment, it stands at 12.7%.	Yes
29115	The mean price of a health care insurance plan in the US is currently $5,800.	Yes
8239	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	No
29021	Some welfare recipients who use welfare, housing, Medicaid, and food stamps laws earn more than $10 thousand per year without paying any taxes.	Yes
29125	You voted 126 times against the proposed tax reduction after they made their proposal.	Yes
29182	The Kerr bill provided for the benefit of all individuals who were not on Social Security.	Yes
29051	The Israelis have received more than 45 percent of the economic and military aid we have provided since the establishment of Israel two decades ago.	Yes
6215	And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.	No
7336	Now, let me just share something.	No
6002	We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.	Yes
28261	If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.	No
23993	And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man.	No
9735	But the last point I want to make is this.	No
29220	I was proud to have filled my Cabinet and senior staff, as the University of New York in Albany conducted a survey across all 50 states and discovered that my state had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.	Yes
6107	So here's what we do.	No
17749	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	No
11676	I don't think we agree on that.	No
5570	Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?	No
5527	And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.	No
6406	I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.	No
29110	You will be imposing taxation on health care benefits for the first time in history.	Yes
7657	Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.	No
16316	I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power.	No
8010	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	Yes
28438	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.	No
16015	He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.	Yes
9244	Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.	Yes
29027	Our job losses in the past month have been totalled out to 160,000.	Yes
9164	Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.	No
15646	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	No
16276	Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.	No
13469	I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.	No
16233	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	No
11327	But here's what I do know.	No
29242	The unemployment rate in this country remains uncut due to the complete record.	Yes
6276	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	No
29252	The number of people waiting in line to legally arrive is 4 million.	Yes
10713	I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.	No
10687	So that would be priority number one.	No
16340	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.	No
26794	All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	No
6596	When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.	Yes
2879	And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.	Yes
16853	And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.	Yes
29219	The cost of the proposed elimination of estate tax, as well as the impact on corporate and tax code changes, is estimated to be $5 trillion.	Yes
16131	It's a contract between generations.	No
29328	Our team has undergone a 25% decrease since my first year as president.	Yes
24495	The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.	Yes
24087	(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.	No
26982	But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.	No
10275	The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.	No
15751	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
29258	The suggestion to decrease the corporate tax rate is shared by both me and Governor Romney.	Yes
29307	Even though we distributed less than five percent of the total technical assistance funds globally, we still gave them some.	Yes
5565	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.	No
29088	During your debate with Senator Clinton, you didn't tell the American people the truth because you were caught on camera negotiating with John McCain about public funding.	Yes
8255	Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.	No
7269	But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.	No
29195	Governor Reagan's campaign involves a push for the Constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion.	Yes
23906	It's a question of character and judgment.	No
24117	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	No
29144	Despite the fact that one percent of Americans received an $89 billion tax cut last year, people's dedication to their families and upbringing are overshadowed by politicians who disregard family values.	Yes
7082	I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.	No
29268	Even though we may not be completely blameless, we have witnessed the most significant surge in deficit spending and national debt in our history over the past eight years.	Yes
10753	Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.	Yes
29156	I have never implied that Cuba was lost except for the present.	Yes
5654	Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.	Yes
16828	Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.	No
29148	A significant coalition was formed in 1990 to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.	Yes
12922	If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.	No
10469	Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.	No
29191	Governments are taking $0.44 from every dollar they earn, which is a problem caused by pre-emptive actions taken by the Federal Government and cities.	Yes
16388	Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.	No
16236	But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.	No
16308	But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.	No
6289	So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.	No
29161	An attempt was made by this Administration to provide a billion and equivalence for five years on long-term loan, which they opposed.	Yes
28965	(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end.	No
17331	It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.	No
29127	On 277 occasions, he cast his vote in favor of breaking the budget limit.	Yes
12609	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	Yes
1342	Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.	Yes
10692	We do need to look at our records.	No
29016	I think we need to show some flexibility, and the FDA is making efforts to make new and experimental drugs available to those with a high risk of AIDS from January onwards.	Yes
5736	We need to move in a new direction.	No
29207	With the availability of natural gas, we can create 600,000 jobs and 100 years of energy for our benefit.	Yes
29291	At present, we have a peacekeeping force deployed to Darfur and African Union forces working to put an end to the genocide that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.	Yes
29189	Our program for the Community Trust Fund has received a contribution of $4 billion, and we have already disclosed its source.	Yes
26344	Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.	Yes
7102	The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.	No
29229	Governor Romney not only objected, but he also proposed that employers should have the authority to determine whether a woman is covered by her employer's insurance plan for contraception.	Yes
9190	Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.	Yes
29062	Fannie and Freddie Mae's subprime lending situation was the catalyst for the housing market collapse in America.	Yes
10699	That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.	No
24821	I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.	Yes
24819	And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.	No
24790	I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people.	No
20456	I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday.	No
29077	The government's spending has been completely out of control, with a $10 trillion dollar debt being handed over to children and tens of millions of dollars owed to China.	Yes
10630	And we need to reform.	No
29064	It is clear to everyone that we are currently undergoing the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
29042	One in six people living in poverty serves as evidence.	Yes
5498	The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.	Yes
29244	Despite efforts to reduce unemployment rates, there are still 23 million Americans who are unemployed.	Yes
5830	But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.	No
11340	That's what's at stake in this election.	No
29203	The oil production has reached its highest point in 16 years with this increase.	Yes
3698	So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.	No
15418	I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.	No
15789	We were proud of them.	No
17692	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	Yes
29136	The president's actions are causing the most significant deficits in American history.	Yes
2136	My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.	No
5780	Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.	Yes
3436	Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.	No
29058	Every year, we send $700 billion abroad to countries that are not fond of us.	Yes
29132	Despite the lack of a record, my involvement in writing was crucial as I was one of the original authors on early childhood health care and the expansion of healthcare during the mid-1990s.	Yes
21237	I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.	No
29046	The Soviet Union is keeping Radio Free Europe occupied.	Yes
5948	But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.	No
29201	It's becoming evident that 23 million people in this country are having difficulty finding work.	Yes
28900	And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.	No
29150	Are you aware that $73 billion is being spent by the US government to assist 10 million low- and middle-class families in obtaining higher education?	Yes
29111	Taxing health care benefits for the first time in history will be your responsibility.	Yes
11081	But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.	No
8188	Is the United States standing still?	No
29238	Our efforts have resulted in the preservation of 1,000 jobs.	Yes
17034	We must make this next century the century of the individual.	No
18074	It's the hardest decision a president makes.	No
3695	And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.	No
18933	My opponent opposed the missile defenses.	Yes
15801	These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.	No
7747	Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.	No
9367	I don't think the American people believe that.	No

29162	Mr. Nixon has made an error in stating the record regarding the depressed area bill.	Yes
29319	The Vice President's proposal, which is an extension of Mr. Benson'S program, I reckon will raise the cost by a billion dollars more than the current program currently at about six billion per year, and it has been the most expensive in history.	Yes
29175	In January of this year, Senator Kennedy expressed his preference for aid for school construction, rather than aid to pay teachers.	Yes
27391	Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.	Yes

15578	He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it.	Yes

18509	"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""	No
10799	Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.	Yes

27815	My dad was head of a car company.	No

29231	Despite being correct, his deficits were twice the size of those he created during his four years.	Yes
3896	Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.	Yes
6132	I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.	No
29036	$4 billion is the annual amount paid by the oil industry to corporations for corporate welfare.	Yes
15829	I had something very nice to say in there.	No
6291	Look, we must improve education in this country.	No
24089	If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.	No
29170	We have never explicitly stated our readiness to protect Quemoy and Matsu in case of an attack.	Yes

10586	And we've got to give them a chance.	No
28369	I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.	No
24426	We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.	No
29116	The fact that they didn't align with Senator Obama's ideological beliefs led him to vote against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts.	Yes

26145	But we have to prove we can pay for them.	No
4390	And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.	No
29202	We have achieved our highest oil production in 16 years.	Yes
29060	Due to his lack of faith in a timetable, Senator McCain opposed the funding for troops provided by such legislation.	Yes
7021	And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs.	Yes

29159	Our position received seventy votes, whereas they did not receive any votes.	Yes

3029	Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.	No
3013	As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.	Yes
1502	That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.	No
15409	I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.	No
12780	What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.	Yes
26564	Those are my best ideas about it.	No
2156	But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.	No
29017	We need to demonstrate some flexibility, and the FDA is making efforts to make new and experimental drugs available to those with a high risk of AIDS from January onwards.	Yes
7064	We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.	Yes
1600	We might have to do it slowly.	No

9632	In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs.	Yes
13198	But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.	No
6213	We have to change the culture of America.	No
29226	An economy with 23 million individuals seeking employment opportunities is not a robust economy.	Yes
1128	But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.	No
5512	I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
9693	Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	No
18117	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	No
29139	This president is the first to oversee a job-less economy in 72 years in an American economy that has experienced job losses of 1.6 million.	Yes

7539	I want to thank you for listening tonight.	No
9656	Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.	Yes
9704	He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.	Yes

29067	The majority of small business income taxes, equivalent to 50%, are paid by small businesses.	Yes
24429	But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.

24693	I mean, look at the facts.	No
17773	I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.	No
15527	They want to judge it on the record itself.	No
10629	Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.	Yes
29227	It is not a strong economy when 23 million people are on the lookout for work.	Yes

6910	If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.	No
29293	The energy supply to Europe is largely dependent on the presence of Georgia and Ukraine.	Yes

29209	There has been a 14 percent decline in oil production on government land.	Yes
29066	Small businesses pay 50 per cent of small business income tax.	Yes
15597	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	No
6993	We're going to protect Social Security.	No
29075	The American people must understand that the $750 billion rescue package can provide taxpayers with a refund if it's properly managed, especially as I am responsible for its implementation.	Yes
5894	And the facts are facts and records are records.	No
