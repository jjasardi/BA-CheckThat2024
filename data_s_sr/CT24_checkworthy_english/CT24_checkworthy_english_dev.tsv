13413	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	No

16233	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	No

32419	That's one that I haven't...	No
1247	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	No
19975	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	No
27907	Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.	No
29763	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	No
30386	But it's bad, bad experience.	No
17747	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	No
12604	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	Yes
18412	I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do.	No
4132	And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	No
27273	And they include you and me.	No
32519	I want to invest in hard-working families.	No

876	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.	No
15591	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	No
4354	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	No
3019	If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.	No
25254	What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?	No
18181	Does that make you feel safer in America?	No
20223	I come from West Texas.	No
37440	There's no way they would give it up.	No
17619	You can't wish it away.	No
12931	Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.	Yes
27622	Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	No

22029	Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	No
1272	And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.	Yes
22631	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	No
27990	I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	No
7068	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	No
12886	We can put the Communists on the defensive.	No
15934	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	No
6589	We raise the student loans.	No
7301	"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"	No
25457	As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.	No
27969	I want to see peace.	No
19190	They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.	Yes

7314	No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.	No
1320	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	No

22566	So I complain about that.	No

28453	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	No

8594	We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.	Yes
11427	And we have to keep our military strong.	No
5687	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	Yes
28638	The Vice President is right, by the way.	No
14049	I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.	Yes
34158	He has consistently denied what is...	Yes
24395	One last point on the missiles.	No
13693	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	Yes
20954	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	No
16203	I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.	Yes
24199	Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it.	No
22801	"But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, ""Nope."	Yes
24266	We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	Yes
18967	Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.	No
29780	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	No
22851	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	No
11973	As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.	No
19336	You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.	Yes
1397	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	No
13425	He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.	No
33333	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	No
19566	That would be my position.	No
8341	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	No
13091	I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.	No
22088	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	No
68	But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	No
23853	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	Yes
24948	What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	No
7151	We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.	No
11290	Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions.	No
8857	I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.	No
18453	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	No
15512	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	No
24730	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	No
30387	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	Yes
15909	But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions.	No
19487	But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.	Yes
22714	Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections.	No
16296	Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	No
24429	But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.	Yes
4339	We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	No
23755	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	No
11064	So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.	No
32025	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	Yes
6590	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	No
22243	By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	No
16361	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	No
21761	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	No
31992	So don't tell me about words.	No
12130	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	Yes
17720	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	No
9518	My five-point plan does it.	No
26675	It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	No
8317	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	No
18731	And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	No
16270	And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	No
3831	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	No
3356	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	No
27420	First of all, Israel is a true friend.	Yes
10892	I'm just trying to keep up with John.	No
13748	One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.	Yes
18096	As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	Yes
20657	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	No
21154	I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.	No
23837	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	No
27358	But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts.	Yes
9033	I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.	No
34081	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	Yes
15569	So I'm pledged to do that.	No
5514	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	Yes
22693	Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.	Yes
29374	I'm very proud of it.	No
1572	I served an a hospital authority.	No
6136	If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	Yes
15981	And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic.	No
13376	But Social Security is a tax.	No
10224	That's total over the last four years.	Yes
11510	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	No
7203	One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.	Yes
34241	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	No
21610	We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	No
20389	Let me call your attention to the key word there.	No
22297	My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.	No
8738	Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.	No
23930	When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket.	No
25505	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	Yes
21407	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	No
2638	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	No
12870	They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	No
17023	Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	Yes
9809	He hasn't done that either.	No
30217	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	Yes
10481	And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.	No
16275	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	No
13303	On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.	No
27547	Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.	No
3788	It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.	No
3806	And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.	No
9942	And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.	No
15208	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	Yes
28163	We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient's bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that's been left out.	No
26633	And that's the economic package again.	No
15296	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.	No
3649	It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.	No
26734	People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.	No
3333	This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.	Yes
24818	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	No
2389	If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.	No
14520	The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.	No
14029	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	No
19235	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	Yes
21891	That's the way the game's played now.	No
12914	I have always opposed drawing a line.	Yes
14454	And that will be my policy.	No
17577	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	No
12773	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	No
12532	One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.	Yes
13596	It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	No
30212	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	Yes
25292	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	No
4283	What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	No
3729	But John is right we have to make cuts.	No
33967	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	Yes
11681	Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.	No
28982	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	No
2065	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	No
39198	And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to conf--to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate.	Yes
29104	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	No
16502	When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.	Yes
19673	I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.	No
10688	Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.	Yes
26570	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	No
33276	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	No
19571	Devastated states like California and others.	No
16520	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	No
17729	It's ruining us in trade.	No
14898	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	Yes
11036	He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.	No
32967	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	Yes
7699	We are in a very difficult time.	No
8443	On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.	Yes
24327	National security, economic strength, democracy.	No
18461	My opponent calls it a mistake.	No
2471	That's already offered in the private marketplace.	Yes
27405	Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.	No
7664	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	No
13276	That's not the position he's taking.	Yes
20679	I'm going to rebuild our military power.	No
6683	Let me start with the Pell Grants.	No
3262	Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.	No
10681	And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.	Yes
5952	We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.	No
25138	In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.	No
10970	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?	No
28328	I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.	No
4405	That's where I get my name.	No
4384	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	No
614	We're going to have to do that.	No
1296	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	Yes
29886	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	No
18033	I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.	No
27461	would agree with us as well.	No
2679	We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.	No
10802	Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.	No
5834	Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies.	No
15227	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	Yes
3049	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	No
33822	I believe it was her campaign that did it.	No
1817	But that -- that is not the case.	No
23707	That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.	Yes
28145	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	No
28271	And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.	Yes
17555	He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.	Yes
33767	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.	No
11797	So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â Now, we trust freedom.	No
27804	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	No
26127	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	No
3241	I don't agree with that statement.	No
4227	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	No
702	You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.	No
9907	"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation."""	Yes
24649	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	No
13018	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	No
33701	So I just left some high representatives of India.	No
12350	I apologize, Mr. Vice President.	No
19790	But Kenny was a great talker.	No
20898	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	Yes
16473	At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	Yes
9259	So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.	No
23823	This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	No
137	It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.	No
433	I don't think most people do.	No
24157	So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.	No
14813	Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	No
26244	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	No
791	Now we have a chance.	No
15391	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	No
31991	Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.	No
11650	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	No
7653	Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.	No
32403	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	Yes
24191	Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.	No
16488	That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.	Yes
29516	You know what that is?	No
12915	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	No
23176	He's been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasn't addressed it.	Yes
24516	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	No
12933	Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.	No
9174	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	No
27426	I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.	No
14702	I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.	No
188	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	No
10930	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	Yes
23064	We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles.	No
24087	(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.	No
24139	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	No
34334	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	No
19596	We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.	No
22656	And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.	No
11669	I want to be judicious in its use.	No
461	And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	No
28758	Tell you what I hear.	No
385	This is a question of organizing the housing community.	No
23131	And that's saying something in that bunch.	No
33037	I will bring our energy companies back.	No
32209	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	No
13143	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	No
14551	Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.	No
33386	I voted for border security, and there are...	Yes
11240	The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.	No
25464	Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.	No
33312	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	Yes
32692	And Iran is killing ISIS.	Yes
6912	You want to buy into it, you can.	No
14430	And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	Yes
29772	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	No
27640	We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.	No
18173	And there are a long list of thing.	No
6895	It gives you the choice.	No
30371	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	No
28543	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	No
13513	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	Yes
951	We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.	No
2202	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	Yes
5733	But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.	No
22818	You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.	No
2532	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	No
28043	And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured.	No
38619	It's important that people know.	No
10613	We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.	No
15816	He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	Yes
3463	And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.	No
15751	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
30409	Where did you find this?	No
5494	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	No
38169	Excuse me, he made a statement.	No
23608	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	No
20595	As the vice president is.	No
19747	We've lost credibility around the world.	No
28367	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	No
8045	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	No
10226	We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.	No
27522	We need to indict Ahmadinejad.	No
20420	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	No
12939	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	No
12205	He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	Yes
25574	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	No
3265	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	No
25856	Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	No
886	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	No
8140	He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	Yes
12213	We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.	Yes
474	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	No
8573	They start from a much lower base.	No
5589	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	Yes
32340	How do you do that?	No
37677	If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me.	No
12076	And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.	No
34362	It may be because of our experiences.	No
23780	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	No
15443	I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	No
842	And he's kept his head up.	No
3082	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	No
2551	But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.	No
10526	I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.	No
14301	But look who's around with him there.	No
3675	We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.	Yes
6480	As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.	No
11349	The challenges that we face are unprecedented.	No
15639	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	No
27116	As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible.	Yes
23012	Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.	No
25942	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	Yes
17886	Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	No
29517	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	No
32941	Five million homes were lost.	Yes
40882	If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under - in three years - than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely.	Yes
20635	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	No
13182	There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.	Yes
2218	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	No
13031	In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	No
24347	And we're going to keep on doing that.	No
2159	In fact he is on Medicare.	Yes
17882	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	No
16613	I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.	No
18478	Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.	Yes
3044	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	No
21979	It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	Yes
32683	She wants to fight for rebels.	Yes
26324	He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.	No
21139	We need to think differently about the issue.	No
12955	We had a recession in fifty-four.	No
20512	I support a woman's right to choose.	No
19213	But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.	No
33283	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	No
28120	Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.	Yes
23744	Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.	No
34352	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	No
26478	Credit card debt has never been higher.	Yes
13642	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	No
11032	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	No
23865	We need a new approach.	No
1691	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	No
166	A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.	No
6663	"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """	No
23279	I mean, you've got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.	No
31979	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	No
16059	And I'm very proud of it.	No
28694	I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	No
24099	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	Yes
22491	We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.	No
13335	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	No
18001	No, I don't believe it's going to happen.	No
7931	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	No
27372	I was on the world of business for 25 years.	No
34038	So let me just give you one other thing.	No
25198	But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	Yes
17647	We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.	Yes
25199	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	No
14709	It's not trickle down economics.	No
24445	A family involves at least one parent, whether natural or adoptive or foster, and children.	No
16621	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	No
7496	More than ever, we need to be united as a country.	No
24932	It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.	Yes
26958	Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	Yes
7737	Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.	No
12278	He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.	Yes
3034	Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.	Yes
2740	But they lead in very different directions.	No
18144	More in September than in August.	Yes
22942	If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.	Yes
34443	We have a depleted military.	Yes
19409	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	No
13011	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	Yes
23549	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	Yes
30280	At the same time, we have to be prepared.	No
33829	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.	No
26936	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	No
29182	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	No
23055	You know what he said?	No
15091	Barbara, you've asked that question twice.	No
7440	So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.	Yes
5715	I have fought against spending.	Yes
458	But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.	No
32860	So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.	No
7997	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	No
3433	And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.	Yes
16572	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	No
32992	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	Yes
33890	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	Yes
896	But you talk about judgment.	No
27634	And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.	No
8669	I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.	No
40482	The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there?	No
8270	It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.	No
17507	And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	No
15102	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	No
23382	Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs.	Yes
40771	I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord.	No
723	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	No
10717	And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.	No
10297	They hack into our computers.	Yes
20271	The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.	Yes
7503	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	No
1510	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	No
12896	We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.	No
12322	I'm not for command and control techniques either.	No
19929	Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.	No
6562	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	No
33625	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.	Yes
3205	If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.	No
1418	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	No
5583	But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.	No
12143	It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.	No
17158	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	Yes
3015	This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.	No
3021	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	Yes
9357	The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.	No
955	Who has the experience that we trust?	No
23613	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	No
33852	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	Yes
17850	Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?	No
7759	It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.	No
33717	I've visited so many communities.	No
15421	I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.	No
8159	And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	No
9970	I don't check it that often.	No
11560	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	No
4247	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	No
201	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	Yes
5724	I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.	Yes
13865	Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	No
12018	I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.	No
21608	I went to a boys' club.	No
6268	Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.	No
15976	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	Yes
6717	That's not what we want.	No
28128	All right, here we go again.	No
4410	And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.	No
27396	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	No
25606	A President must know right then.	No
11365	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	No
6643	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	Yes
34427	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	No
6215	And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.	No
20807	I want to say something, Jim.	No
16553	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	Yes
26780	Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.	No
2292	And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.	Yes
18216	The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?	No
32578	Why didn't you do it?	No
4070	What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.	Yes
22718	Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.	No
15043	To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.	No
17306	It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.	No
9620	"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?"""	No
3280	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	Yes
1679	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	No
10245	That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here.	No
543	The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.	Yes
7286	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	No
5765	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	No
1231	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	Yes
673	It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.	No
11461	We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.	No
5708	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	No
29830	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	Yes
10548	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	No
15261	It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.	Yes
15081	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	No
20157	I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.	No
20116	He didn't do all these things.	Yes
23460	Dick Cheney's counted as a small business.	No
7872	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	No
5768	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	Yes
15448	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	No
17365	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	No
28342	I'm not just saying this.	No
13098	We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.	No
19298	We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.	Yes
22460	And we have got to put our nation back to work.	No
20332	My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.	No
12539	That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.	No
26965	You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.	No
207	The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.	No
26755	That's the way the system works.	No
12910	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	No
9759	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	Yes
2689	But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.	No
13460	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	No
29972	And I'm very, very proud of it.	No
20245	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	Yes
19367	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	Yes
27741	It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	Yes
3148	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	No
17878	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	No
12657	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	No
29176	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	Yes
20514	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	No
10053	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	No
5608	Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.	Yes
8167	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	No
11108	So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.	Yes
33071	A lot of them lost their lives.	No
6612	I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.	No
7210	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	No
37802	"Many of your Democrat Governors said, \President Trump did a phenomenal job.\"""""	Yes
2947	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	No
32050	Because you'd be in jail.	No
6029	The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.	Yes
6902	You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.	Yes
14088	What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.	No
28565	Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.	No
19752	We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.	Yes
13990	He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.	Yes
15974	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	Yes
10253	"They say, ""We feel like we're under attack from our own government."""	No
9539	That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.	Yes
9795	We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.	No
21890	Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through.	No
11335	Wages and incomes have gone down.	Yes
9452	Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.	No
6720	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	Yes
19408	I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.	Yes
19402	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	No
34173	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	No
11485	Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.	Yes
29571	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	No
1067	Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.	No
18722	Let me say -- I certainly hope so.	No
99	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	No
662	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	No
39673	Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.	No
13025	One other point I would make: what could you do?	No
10936	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	No
24055	Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.	No
14103	Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests.	No
25608	And that's why this election is so terribly important.	No
18613	And that's why it is essential we not leave.	No
22299	It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.	Yes
21469	And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.	No
6606	It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.	No
1206	Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.	Yes
28088	Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.	No
10928	And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.	Yes
29532	I get audited by the IRS.	Yes
15844	I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.	No
5658	I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.	Yes
17477	I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	No
24585	I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	No
25113	Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.	Yes
425	I'm also very tough on violent crime.	No
13341	I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.	No
24291	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	No
8361	Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.	Yes
4133	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	Yes
29263	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	No
26344	Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.	Yes
2536	And I said that at that time.	No
2901	This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.	No
17724	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	No
498	But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.	No
25220	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	Yes
8118	If we fail, then freedom fails.	No
2419	What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.	Yes
13969	I have a realistic approach to trade.	No
20938	Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?	No
7797	I believe we can do it.	No
23097	John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.	No
19924	Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.	Yes
8110	In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.	No
19446	I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.	No
18135	Some of them got it for a birthday present.	No
13913	See, there's a lot I don't understand.	No
19666	Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.	Yes
11016	That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.	No
19936	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	No
19216	But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.	No
24991	We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.	Yes
25900	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	No
38862	And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets.	Yes
20053	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	No
39876	The foreign countries are paying you a lot.	Yes
28890	It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.	No
15793	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	No
25212	We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.	Yes
12790	Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.	No
17173	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	No
32626	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	Yes
38194	I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax.	Yes
10543	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	No
24617	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	No
7842	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	Yes
21332	So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.	No
2709	And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.	No
14692	We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.	No
6248	He's health for the mother.	No
17028	It was a superb occasion.	No
7974	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	No
28501	I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.	No
22124	And only the US could do this.	No
7535	We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate.	No
14324	And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.	No
23495	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	No
20671	The warning signs are real.	No
20858	I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance.	No
12070	I also believe in the Golden Rule.	No
14733	And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?	No
11070	Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.	Yes
10068	I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.	No
21509	And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.	No
29236	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	Yes
13326	I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.	Yes
25523	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	Yes
29923	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	No
14849	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	No
2858	The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.	No
11397	What's in the best interests of our people?	No
21814	Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.	No
26585	And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.	No
17288	This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.	Yes
18495	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	No
27437	Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.	Yes
15408	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	No
14727	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	No
11943	I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.	Yes
6285	Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.	No
22750	The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	No
14863	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	No
18124	That's the plan for victory.	No
19364	I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.	No
18134	I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.	Yes
19483	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	Yes
3775	Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.	Yes
33964	I'd like to mention one thing.	No
30412	... she's going to vote this November.	No
18501	You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.	No
28323	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	No
33573	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	No
7886	Let me make my position cl ear.	No
16237	If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.	No
9523	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	No
6744	My opponent was against it.	No
26001	First of all, there are two different things.	No
22247	Those schools belong to you.	No
7678	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	No
29936	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	No
19533	We turn it over to the United Nations.	Yes
14827	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	Yes
16346	And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.	No
95	And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.	No
10025	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	No
2158	And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.	No
11146	Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.	No
416	They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.	Yes
29411	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	No
27584	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	No
21382	I'd like the government to have that.	No
21758	I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.	No
7232	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	No
12522	I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.	No
27872	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	No
23250	Do you know what he presented us with?	No
16313	Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?	No
27403	But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.	No
33794	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	No
25298	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	No
27644	We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.	Yes
14840	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	No
10579	Americans' workers are the best in the world.	No
30017	Look at the mess that we're in.	No
757	Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	Yes
19892	And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.	Yes
6328	And we need to fix a lot of the problems.	No
2315	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	No
557	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	No
7318	I was chairman of it once.	No
18661	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	No
4158	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	No
15193	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	No
32747	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.	No
33671	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	No
18981	But we always have to stand up for democracy.	No
30172	And that was before the war started.	No
22613	But 9/11 changed it all.	No
13446	Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.	No
18202	But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.	No
493	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	No
11520	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	No
22998	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	No
19185	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	No
19527	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	Yes
22377	Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	No
32937	That was a terrible time for our country.	No
8591	And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.	Yes
6251	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	No
8679	I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.	No
15605	(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.	No
19458	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	Yes
12535	We learned from their mistakes.	No
3554	This one's kind of old.	No
10615	We are mortgaging our children's future.	No
28712	And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.	No
28324	We need to have accountability.	No
9462	The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.	No
6751	And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.	No
6247	Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.	No
3873	I was honored to speak to those troops.	No
28252	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	Yes
25506	Many of them are now the contras.	Yes
10879	Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.	No
1181	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	No
1541	But those are not the things that count.	No
21648	I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.	No
12537	We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.	Yes
8733	possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	Yes
22273	And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage.	No
18050	First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.	No
33913	In partnership with the American Health Association...	No
6992	And that's what we're going to do.	No
12782	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	No
3175	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	No
19599	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	No
23921	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	No
18132	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	No
20964	I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.	No
27463	I would tighten those sanctions further.	No
10227	What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.	No
3703	We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.	No
1886	That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	No
27169	We didn't ask for it.	No
12948	I served it uh - in the war.	No
6187	I would consider anyone in their qualifications.	No
9704	He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.	Yes
24773	Now I'm back to square one.	No
23034	And we've just got to make sure, before somebody thinks they're buying a product, that it works.	No
8977	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	No
2707	When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.	No
32339	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	Yes
29861	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	No
10238	And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.	Yes
21037	If I could respond, Jim.	No
891	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	No
29116	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	No
25630	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	No
12067	But there's a larger law.	No
33686	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	No
33247	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	No
1243	This has not been done, unfortunately.	No
12446	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	No
19820	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	No
17892	Will our children be better off?	No
16508	And this is what the Republicans have done to us.	No
17700	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	No
1594	Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.	No
3878	We don't want our kids coming back here.	No
6076	That will -- that will reduce costs.	No
15437	And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.	No
7191	So I don't intend to see it undone.	No
8302	The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.	Yes
2500	But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.	Yes
5892	So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.	No
16642	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	No
26517	Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.	No
17860	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	Yes
21073	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	Yes
17098	So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	Yes
17182	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	Yes
19041	The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.	No
10614	We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.	No
10630	And we need to reform.	No
18268	We didn't guard the borders.	No
23621	Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.	No
6111	Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.	No
19326	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	No
2441	It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?	No
21009	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	No
8390	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	No
19100	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	Yes
31892	But this is locker room talk.	No
40156	I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy.	No
5595	We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.	No
8438	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	No
14837	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	No
32999	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	No
7744	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	No
24567	We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	No
27605	And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.	No
32987	And I think that this is so important.	No
9703	President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	Yes
33475	... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	No
2921	And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.	No
26765	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	No
25322	And I supported this bill.	Yes
30028	Look what happened to her.	No
7035	If you have a child, you got tax relief.	Yes
13208	I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.	No
559	And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	No
7154	Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.	No
7486	They don't let me get away with anything.	No
16378	We can do better than that.	No
21899	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	No
27784	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	No
39414	And by the way, our military--they've been voting by ballots for since the end of the Civil War, in effect.	Yes
21560	The ideas I express are mine.	No
17556	In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	Yes
10815	I want to get to Medicare in a second.	No
25307	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	No
24928	I have ordered an investigation.	Yes
26182	I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.	No
23361	Boy, to listen to that -- the president, I don't think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment.	No
9309	So what I've tried to do is be consistent.	No
7324	The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.	No
6129	Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.	No
13257	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	No
312	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	No
2145	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	No
23680	And I'll take responsibility for them.	No
24341	We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.	No
38294	And plenty of companies that are already here, they'll leave for other places.	Yes
29960	It was very easy to do.	No
4367	In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.	No
10875	The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	Yes
488	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	No
32560	Why didn't she do something about it?	No
2821	And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.	Yes
4197	It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	No
28240	We have huge difference between us on this question.	No
12770	I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.	No
11775	The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	No
11145	It'd be fine with me.	No
12601	Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	No
10137	We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.	No
16622	I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	Yes
3926	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	Yes
20227	I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	No
9793	I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.	No
9709	I came through small business.	No
12310	I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.	No
23296	We've got battling green eye shades.	No
25753	I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked.	No
25760	They're looking to us for leadership.	No
33327	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	No
26627	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	Yes
5653	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	Yes
26007	And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century.	Yes
21047	It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.	Yes
4381	We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.	Yes
3962	You don't say that out loud.	No
24740	We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government.	Yes
27442	The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.	Yes
37778	And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing.	No
27210	We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	No
32218	... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	No
23913	But I -- I couldn't do that.	No
6981	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	Yes
13747	"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!"""	No
12838	I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.	No
2071	That is not a recipe for growth.	No
22425	I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.	No
9331	You want me to answer a question --	No
32879	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	No
7149	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	No
20876	They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.	No
32676	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	No
33030	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	Yes
3028	Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.	Yes
14080	I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.	No
25129	And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.	No
20825	A guy named Michael runs the school.	No
33844	I did not say that.	Yes
11452	We need to do more.	No
17758	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	No
9700	I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.	No
11332	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	No
2426	We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.	No
27538	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	Yes
24244	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	No
5840	In fact, some T-shirts that are very...	No
20735	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	No
10873	It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.	No
16662	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	No
13450	But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.	No
18865	I don't think that's my job or my business.	No
2092	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	Yes
28987	And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	Yes
17560	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	No
22898	For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.	Yes
29569	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	Yes
16610	This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	No
7492	And I think we're both very lucky.	No
7706	They set a low standard of materialism.	No
2490	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	Yes
7115	We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.	Yes
26365	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	Yes
34259	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	Yes
29624	We're a serious debtor nation.	Yes
7998	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	No
24353	They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.	No
17405	Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	No
19372	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	Yes
26795	This is what it's all about.	No
23104	You can pull it off of the Internet.	No
20144	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	No
17748	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	No
13373	I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.	No
17117	One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.	No
19203	Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.	Yes
5861	But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.	No
16723	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	No
29912	Secretary Clinton also fought it.	Yes
1026	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	No
15295	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	No
17959	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	No
11704	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	Yes
15024	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	Yes
26758	You see it in the church burnings.	No
29948	I would love to respond.	No
17788	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	Yes
17519	Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.	No
23918	"How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, ""Well, I'm not going to go."	No
34244	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	No
29633	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	No

12171	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	Yes
40439	Who built the cages, Joe?	No
22152	I'd rather answer her question first and then I'll be glad to.	No

12805	The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.	No
969	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	No
16494	It has some good provisions in it.	No
22204	First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.	No
23282	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	No
14411	Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	No
23857	We have got to have the courage to change.	No
7587	Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.	Yes

23600	Will we have equal opportunity?	No
14521	My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.

12011	That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.	Yes
24825	This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	No
27337	So I'd get rid of that one from day one.	No
4072	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	No
463	And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.	No

20652	And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	No
492	I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.	No
2645	And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.	No
2483	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	No

22484	Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.	No
9861	And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.	No
1444	It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.	No
23032	I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	No
