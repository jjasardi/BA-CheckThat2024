11141	It'd be fine with me.	No
4045	By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.	No

29962	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	No
11458	I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.

12395	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	Yes
27652	You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	No
24019	And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War.	No
16230	Now we've got three of them.	No
13378	It comes right out of your paycheck.	No
1684	This is obviously a very tender topic.	No
11348	And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.	No
10597	Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.	No
16945	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	No
33149	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	Yes
11879	I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.	No
3632	Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.	No
1592	But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	Yes
8179	Where, then, do we disagree?	No
16013	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	No
33729	She did call it the gold standard.	Yes
17865	We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.	Yes
32666	You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.	No
32370	And they don't want them.	No
1892	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	Yes
9833	He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.	No
21876	A senator runs every 6 years.	No
15911	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	No
6894	The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.	No
5500	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	Yes
21211	And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.	No
18456	He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.	Yes
6306	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	Yes
25346	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	Yes
21748	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	No
24186	Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.	No
6559	I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	No
10021	So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.	No
28922	If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?	No
27434	So their economy is in a shambles.	Yes
28956	I promise you I will keep mine.	No
27655	The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.	Yes
20569	A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.	No
27524	Bob, let me just respond.	No
29062	For those of you for me, thanks for your help.	No
4344	And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.	No
11885	Is anybody being discriminated against?	No
3513	And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	No
19923	The American people should make up their own mind.	No
13313	We must not be divided on this issue.	No
26051	What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.	No
8437	My objection here is not the cost in dollars.	No
27761	They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?	No
27586	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	No
27525	Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.	No
6505	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	No
7961	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	No
33199	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	Yes
22296	I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	No
12643	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	Yes
3626	"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich."""	No
15784	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	No
12755	Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.	No
21462	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	No
10539	There were others who took a hike.	No
22496	We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	No
28362	He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.	Yes
10371	That's not what I believe.	No
19345	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	No
750	Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.	No
33509	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.	No
18502	I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.	No
25754	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	No
12569	And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.	No
11492	The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.	No
2226	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	No
2494	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	Yes
16142	Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.	No
13495	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	No
32080	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	No
9707	And then let's take the last one, championing small business.	No
13017	Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	No
22954	I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.	No
17424	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	No
27999	I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.	No
11268	But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.	No
16044	I won't support judges like that.	No
23980	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	No
28824	I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.	Yes
25975	I think I did the right thing.	No
11207	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	No
2044	Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.	Yes
2849	The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.	Yes
2305	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	No
19459	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	No
16554	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	Yes
4157	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	No
16910	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	No
10375	That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.	No
34056	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	Yes
16066	These appointments are for life.	No
23643	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	No
19749	Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.	No
39018	Now, so, and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out.	No
9315	That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.	Yes
13801	Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.	No
25325	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	No
22849	And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.	Yes
6153	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	Yes
29281	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	No
1331	So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.	No
27726	And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.	No
17853	So far, it is only a beginning.	No
26787	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	No
6942	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	No
27602	And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	No
29950	You treated him with terrible disrespect.	No
24151	And there will be a significant transition.	No
24681	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	No
22679	And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	No
16625	But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	No
15235	I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.	No
25395	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.	No
23376	In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they're doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality.	Yes
5568	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	Yes
29703	We have to work with the police.	No
13462	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	No
4024	And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.	No
21494	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	No
33058	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	No
20386	They have had their chance to get something done.	No
1959	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	No
16599	This needs to be changed.	No
25902	I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don't believe that will be the request.	No
22457	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	No
14452	We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.	Yes
2903	So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	No
29128	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	Yes
4311	And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.	Yes
23086	Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.	Yes
21253	We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind.	No
26733	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	No
11157	"Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" who called for the annihilation of North Korea."	No
32812	As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.	No
2555	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	No
27607	And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.	No
1755	But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.	Yes
23778	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	No
19617	And the United States needs help from other countries.	No
19776	But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.	No
11783	I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.	No
22783	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	No
33401	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	Yes
26916	Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.	No
271	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	No
18749	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	Yes
27502	And that clock is ticking.	No
27497	And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.	No
33630	But they have to pay up.	No
8228	The question is the means.	No
40705	They should be going into treatment across the board.	No
2929	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	Yes
24949	He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	No
23504	This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	No
26569	"One vote doesn't make a difference."""	No
3030	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	No
345	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	No
25449	Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?	No
28039	And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.	No
24385	He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.	No
28804	What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.	No
14207	We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.	No
17279	I have a deep religious faith.	No
27121	We -- we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.	Yes
7908	There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.	Yes
25062	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	Yes
14915	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	Yes
2931	The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.	Yes
7762	Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.	Yes
24001	Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, it's minimum-wage jobs.	Yes
2388	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	Yes
4220	It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.	No
14328	Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.	No
17813	This administration seems to run that every morning.	No
7326	Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.	No
6346	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	Yes
25919	But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.	No
19510	We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.	Yes
2113	We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.	No
610	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	No
28825	I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.	No
32459	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	No
2485	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	Yes
25374	What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	No
18872	And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	No
24103	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	No
19107	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	No
32380	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	Yes
29748	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	Yes
20781	No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts.	No
32551	So we won't make them famous.	No
20660	First of all Ã‚ I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.	No
20529	I just think that we ought to support the decision.	No
5971	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	No
32013	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	No
23506	They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise.	No
20340	Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.	No
11399	Is it in our nation's interests?	No
19477	Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.	No
16228	The American people are up to here with debates.	No
4151	By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.	No
11731	I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.	No
22249	Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get.	No
14412	I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.	No
25380	We'll even give it to you.	No
9306	We're encouraging it and working with the industry.	No
30032	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	No
3226	Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.	Yes
32848	And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.	No
2337	It wasn't thought through properly.	No
1775	I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	No
18564	"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	No
20855	We agree on a couple of things on education.	No
26555	Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.	No
17874	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	No
2946	I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.	Yes
22320	I commend it to anybody.	No
28325	The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.	Yes
24607	We're funding them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	Yes
25985	The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven't done anything on drugs.	No
